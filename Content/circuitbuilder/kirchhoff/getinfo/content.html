<div class="title">Kirchhoff's Laws</div>

<p align="center"><img src="KirchhoffCurrent.gif"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

<p>Figure 1 shows a junction in an electric circuit at which three
branches are joined.  Positive directions have been defined in the
branches.  They are indicated by arrows.  A current has a positive
value if its direction coincides with the positive direction in the
branch where the current is.  The branches in the diagram above are
labeled 1 to 3, and the currents in the branches will be labeled
<i>I<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>I<sub>3</sub></i>, accordingly.</p>

<blockquote>Kirchhoff's Junction Rule (Current Law) says that the sum
of the currents entering a junction is equal to the sum of the
currents leaving the junction.

<p>In the case of the situation in Figure 1, this amounts to</p>

<p class="equation"><i>I<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>I<sub>2</sub></i> =
<i>I<sub>3</sub></i>.</blockquote>

<p>For the purpose of this rule, a current is considered to be
entering (leaving) the junction if the direction assigned to the
branch in which the current is points to (away from) the junction.  In
our example, currents 1 and 2 are entering the junction and current 3
is leaving it.

<p>The real directions of the currents may be different from what this
terminology suggests.  E.g., current 1 may be directed to the left,
i.e., away from the junction.  We will still treat the current as if
it were entering the junction, but will assign it a negative value
because its direction is opposite to that defined as positive by the
arrows in branch 1.  The direction of the arrows is a matter of
choice, not fact.

<p>In writing down the junction equation, one assumes that all
currents are in the positive directions.  The resulting equation will
be correct, no matter what the actual current directions are, as long
as the currents are given the appropriate sign.</p>

<p>The physics underlying Kirchhoff's Junction Rule is the
conservation of electric charge.  We are assuming the circuit is
operating in a steady state.  Then electric charge cannot be building
up at a junction.  Because of charge conservation, the amount of
charge entering the junction per unit time must then be equal to the
amount of charge leaving the junction, in other words, the sum of the
currents entering the junction must equal the sum of the currents
leaving the junction.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Kirchhoff's Loop Rule (Voltage Law)</p>

<p align="center"><img src="KirchhoffVoltage.gif"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

<p>Figure 2 shows an electric circuit with three branches, labeled 1,
2, and 3.  Resistors, resistances, and currents in these branches will
be subscripted with the branch numbers.

<p>Starting from point A, one can move in a closed loop via resistor
R<sub>1</sub>, junction B, resistor R<sub>2</sub>, and junction C back
via the battery to point A.</p>

<blockquote>Kirchhoff's Loop Rule (Voltage Law) says that the sum of
the potential differences encountered in going around a loop in a DC
Circuit is equal to zero.

<p>If the currents in resistors <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>2</sub> are
denoted by <i>I</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>2</sub>,
respectively, where the signs of the currents are chosen relative to
the positive branch directions indicated by arrows in Figure 2,
then Kirchhoff's Loop Rule amounts to the following equation for the
loop described above:</p>

<p class="equation">-<i>R</i><sub>1</sub><i>I</i><sub>1</sub> +
<i>R</i><sub>2</sub><i>I</i><sub>2</sub> + 12 V = 0 .</blockquote>

<p>The signs in this equation can be understood as follows.  Pretend
the currents are in the directions indicated by the arrows.  In going
from A to B one goes in the direction of current <i>I</i><sub>1</sub>.
Currents go from high to low potential.  (We are assuming the
conventional current direction.)  The magnitude of the potential
difference across resistor <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> is equal to
<i>R</i><sub>1</sub><i>I</i><sub>1</sub>.  Since the potential is
decreasing in the direction of the current, the potential difference
in going from A to B is -<i>R</i><sub>1</sub><i>I</i><sub>1</sub>.  In
branch 2 we are moving against the current.  Therefore the potential
changee in going across <i>R</i><sub>2</sub> is
+<i>R</i><sub>2</sub><i>I</i><sub>2</sub> because the potential is
increasing in going against the current.  Finally, in going from C to
A we are crossing the battery from the negative to the positive pole
and therefore are gaining a potential difference of +12 V.


<p>Kirchhoff's Loop Rule holds for any loop that one can find in a
circuit.  Let's apply it to another loop in the present circuit, the
one that goes from A to junction B, then to junction C via the 6-V
battery on the right, then back to A.  If <i>I<sub>3</sub></i> denotes
the current in resistor R<sub>3</sub>, Kirchhoff's Loop Rule gives</p>

<p class="equation">-R<sub>1</sub><i>I<sub>1</sub></i> + 6 V -
R<sub>3</sub><i>I<sub>3</sub></i> + 12 V = 0 .</p>

<p>Kirchhoff's Loop Rule is a consequence of energy conservation, in
the following sense.  Electric potential is defined as the electric
potential energy of a test charge q, divided by q.  Thus, Kirchhoff's
Loop Rule is effectively saying that when a charge q moves around a
loop in a circuit the changes in the potential energy of the charge
add up to zero, which is equivalent to saying the potential energy of
the charge is the same after completing the journey around the loop as
at the start.  This is analogous to the gravitational potential energy
of a roller coaster car.  It does not change overall from the starting
point around the track back to the starting point.</p>

<p>Note that a charge loses electric potential energy as it moves
through a resistor.  The electric potential energy of the charge is
converted in the resistor into thermal energy.  The resistor becomes
warmer.  There must be a source of energy in the loop that does an
equal amount of work on the charge in order to raise its potential
energy back to the original level.  In the circuit illustrated above,
the energy source is a battery.  The battery converts chemical energy
stored within its chemicals into electric potential energy of the
charges passing through it.</p>
