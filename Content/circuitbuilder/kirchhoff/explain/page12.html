<div class="title">Several Batteries</div>

<p>The circuit on the left contains three batteries and three
resistors.  Because of the way the batteries and resistors are
positioned, the resistors are neither in-series nor in-parallel and we
need to go back to Kirchhoff's Laws to calculate the currents in the
circuit.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  How many different currents are there in this
circuit and how many equations are necessary to calculate them?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  There are three branches in the circuit and one
current in each branch, thus a total of three currents.  Each branch
contains one battery.  We need three equations to solve for these
currents.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  How many current and voltage equations are
necessary?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  There will be one current equation, say, the
equation at junction A.  (The equation at junction B gives no new
information.)  In addition, there will be two voltage equations, one
for the loop on the left, one for the loop on the right.</p>

<p>Try to write down these three equations, taking the positive
directions in the three branches to be upward through all three
batteries, and going around the two loops in the clockwise sense.
When done, go to Page 13 to compare.</p>
