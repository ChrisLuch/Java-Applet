<div class="title">The Wheatstone Bridge</div>

<p>A combination of five resistors like that shown on the left is used
in a resistance measuring apparatus called <i>Wheatstone Bridge</i>.
You may want to try to break down this circuit into in-series and
in-parallel combinations of resistors.  It should prove impossible to
do.  To calculate the currents in the different branches of the
circuit we need to use Kirchhoff's Laws.</p>

<p>There are six branches, the branch containing the battery and the
five branches containing one of the five resistors each.  Let us
denote the currents in the six branches by <i>I<sub>0</sub></i> to
<i>I<sub>5</sub></i>, where <i>I<sub>0</sub></i> is the current in
branch 0 containing the battery and <i>I<sub>1</sub></i> to
<i>I<sub>5</sub></i> are the currents in branches 1 to 5 containing
the correspondingly labeled resistors.</p>

<p>We need six equations to solve for the six unknown currents.  Try
to <b>write down</b> three current equations and three voltage
equations that are independent of each other.  When done, go on to
Page 9 to compare.</p>
