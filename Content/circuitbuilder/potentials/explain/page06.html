<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>: The electric potential energy PE of a particle of
charge q at some point is equal to q times the electric potential V at
that point,
</p>

<div class="equation">PE = qV.</div>

<p>The electric potential energy PE of any charge, positive or
negative, decreases in going through a resistor because a resistor
heats up when charged particles pass through it and this thermal energy is
taken from the electric potential energy of the particles passing
through.
</p>

<p>If the PE of a charge q decreases as q goes through a resistor,
then, if q is positive, q must be moving from high to low potential.
Since positive charges move in the conventional current direction,
this direction is from high to low potential as well.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>: How is the potential drop across a resistor related to the
resistance and the current in the resistor?
</p>

<p>The answer will be given on the next page.&nbsp; In the meantime,
you may want to measure the current in the resistor with an
ammeter.
