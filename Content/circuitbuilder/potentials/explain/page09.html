<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p>The potential at point A is 0 V, and it is 12 V at point B.&nbsp;
Thus, the potential change in going from A to B is:
</p>

<div class="equation">V<sub>B</sub> - V<sub>A</sub> = 12 - 0 = 12 V.</div>

<p>
This time the potential change in the direction of the current is
positive. In terms of the analogy between electric potential and
elevation, why should this be so?
</p>

<p>On a hike in the mountains, if you leave your camp in the morning
and return in the evening, you will have gone uphill some of the time,
and downhill at other times. The sum of all the elevation changes will
be zero, because at the end of the day your elevation is the same as
at the beginning of the day.
</p>

<p>Electric potential is analogous to elevation.  Thus, in going
around an electric circuit, when one returns to the starting point one
returns to the same potential, and the sum of the potential changes
around the circuit must be zero.
</p>

<p>In the present circuit, we have two stretches of wire where the
potential changes are zero, we have to go across a resistor where the
potential change is -12 V, and we have to go across a battery where
the potential change is +12 V. This adds up to a total potential
change around the circuit equal to 0 V.
</p>

<p>This can be generalized to one of the two fundamental laws of DC
circuits:
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Kirchhoff's Loop Rule</div>


<p>The sum of the potential changes around
any closed loop in a DC circuit is equal to zero.
