<div class="subtitle">Fluid flow analogue of electric potential</div>

<p>The simulation shows fluid flowing in two pipes of different
diameters and slopes.  The two pipes are a segment of a complete
circuit.  The fluid has different speeds in the two adjoining pipes,
faster in the narrower pipe, so that the current (fluid mass per
second passing a given point) is the same in the two pipes.
</p>

<p>As the fluid moves down the pipes, the gravitational potential
energy of the fluid decreases.  (The loss in potential energy is equal
to the heat generated in the pipes.)
</p>

<p class="definition"><b>Definition</b>.  The <i>gravitational
potential</i> at any point P is equal to the gravitational potential
energy of a particle of mass <i>m</i> at that point divided by the
mass <i>m</i>.  The gravitational potential is independent of <i>m</i>.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  What is the gravitational potential in the pipes
at points with elevation y = 10 m, y = 3 m, and y = 2 m?  Take the
acceleration of gravity, <i>g</i>, to have the value 10 m
s<sup>-2</sup> to make the numbers simple.  When done, go on to the
next page.
