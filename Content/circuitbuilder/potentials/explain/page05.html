<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>: The change in potential as you go from point A to point B across the
resistor is <b>minus</b> 12 V,
</p>

<div class="equation">V<sub>B</sub> - V<sub>A</sub> = 0 - 12 = -12 V.</div>

<p>The potential changes by -12 V rather than +12 V because change is defined
as 'final minus initial value'.&nbsp; In going from A to B, not from B
to A, the potential changes from 12 V to 0 V.&nbsp; The potential decreases
and changes by -12 V.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>: Thus, as one goes across a resistor in the direction of
the current, the potential decreases.&nbsp; Why?
</p>

<p class="hint">Hint: You need to consider how the electric potential energy of an electric
charge changes as it moves through the resistor.
</p>

<p>Once you know what happens to the electric potential energy, you
also know how the electric potential changes, if you know how the two
quantities are related.&nbsp; To review this background, see Electric
Potential under Get Information.
