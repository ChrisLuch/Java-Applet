<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p>Now let us consider how the potential changes as we go around the
entire circuit in the direction of the current.
</p>

<p>You have already checked that the potential does not change along
the wires, because their resistance is negligible. Check again if you
like.  And you have just seen that the potential changes by -12 V when
going across the resistor in the direction of the current.
</p>

<p>The final step in going around the circuit involves going through
the battery, from its negative to its positive pole, from left to
right in the present set-up.&nbsp <b>Question</b>: What is the
potential change in this step? Think carefully, and compare your
answer to that given on the next page.
