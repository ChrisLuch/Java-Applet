<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p>Notice that the direction of the current, outside the battery, is
from high potential to low potential.&nbsp; This is the conventional
current direction which is defined to be that in which positive
electric charges would move.&nbsp; For more information on current
direction, see 'Current' under Get Information.
</p>

<p>Electric potential is analogous to elevation, and electric current
is analogous to a current of water.&nbsp; As water flows from higher
to lower elevation, so does positive electric charge move from higher
to lower electric potential.
</p>

<p>The electric potential changes only in the parts of the circuit
where there is resistance.&nbsp; It does not change significantly
along the wires because wires have very small resistance.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>: What is the change in the electric potential as
you go from the immediate right of the resistor to its immediate left
in the circuit shown here?&nbsp; The answer will be given on the next
page.
