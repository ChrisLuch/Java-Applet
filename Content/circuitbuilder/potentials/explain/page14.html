<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>: The potential difference across the burnt-out light
bulb is 100 V.  The reason is that the filament of the bulb is broken
so that there is now a gap in the circuit and the light bulb acts like
an open switch.  The situation is analogous to that discussed for the
open switch on p.9.  The potential difference across the bulb is equal
to the battery emf, i.e., 100 V. This way the sum of the potential
differences around the circuit is zero.  (100 V is the
<b>magnitude</b> of the potential difference across the burnt-out
bulb.  The actual potential change across the bulb would be -100 V if
we went around the circuit clockwise.)

<p><b>Question</b>: Here is an even harder question.  What will happen if you
now open the switch?  What will be the potential difference across the
bulb?  The answer will be given on the next page.
