<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p>Now that you know the basics about electric potentials in DC
circuits, you are ready to tackle a situation that may be a bit tricky
at first.&nbsp; The circuit shown on the left has a switch inserted in
the wires on the right.&nbsp; The switch is closed so that there is a
current in the circuit.&nbsp; Now open the switch by selecting the
Open Switch button in the display area below the circuit.&nbsp; When
you have done this correctly, the switch will be open and the current
will have stopped.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:&nbsp; What is the change in potential as you go
across the switch when it is open?&nbsp; Or, in other words, what is
the 'potential difference' across the switch?&nbsp; Potential
difference means the difference V<sub>B</sub> - V<sub>A</sub> where A
is a point on one side of the switch and B a point on the other
side.
</p>

<p>The answer will be given on the next page, but try to think of the
answer yourself, <b>with reasons</b> that are based on the
understanding of the electric potential developed on pages 1 to 7.
</p>

<p>You may want to find the answer by connecting a voltmeter to
measure the potential difference across the switch.&nbsp; If you do
that, you still should try to explain what you observe.
