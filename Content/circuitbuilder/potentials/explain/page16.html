<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p>The circuit shown on the left is identical to the one on the
previous page, but with the two meters removed.  The switch is still
open and the light bulb still burnt out.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  What is the potential difference now across the
burnt-out bulb?
</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  It is impossible to say what the potential
difference across the burnt-out light bulb is when the switch is open.
The reason is that the bottom part of the circuit containing the
resistor is now disconnected from the rest of the circuit containing
the battery.
</p>

<p>The potential must be constant along the bottom part because there
is no current here and because the resistance is finite everywhere.
However, one cannot say what this constant value is unless one knows
the capacitances of the burnt-out light bulb and the open switch.
This information is usually unavailable.  (Don't worry if you don't
know what a capacitance is.  This question was added only to show that
not all questions can be answered easily.)
</p>

<p>If you click on any grid point in the bottom part of the circuit,
the program will display a potential with a question mark.
