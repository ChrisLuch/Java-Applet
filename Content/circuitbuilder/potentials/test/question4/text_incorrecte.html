<div class="title">Incorrect</div>

<p>There are three identical resistors in the circuit.  So one might
think that each resistor has one third of the total potential
difference of 12 V across it, which would be 4 V for each resistor.
This would be true if the resistors were all in series.  However, they
are not.</p>

<p><u>Hint</u>. The single resistor on the left is in series with the
in-parallel combination of two resistors on the right.  How is the
total 12-V potential difference divided among these two in-series
resistance elements?</p>

<p>Remember that each of the three resistors has the same
resistance. Let's call it <i>R</i>.  To answer the preceding question,
you need to work out the combined resistance of the in-parallel
combination of resistors in terms of <i>R</i>.  (For the necessary
equation see Resistance under Get Information.)</p>
