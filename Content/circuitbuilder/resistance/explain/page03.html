<div class="title">The Concept of Resistance</div>

<p>Now let us turn to electrical resistance.  The resistor in the
circuit on the left corresponds to the pipe on the preceding two
pages.  There is an electric potential difference of 12 V across the
resistor.  The current in the resistor is 1.2 A.
</p>

<p>Now set the emf of the battery to 24 V and observe the changes in
the circuit.
</p>

<p>When you have done this correctly, the potential difference across
the resistor will have doubled, to 24 V, and so will have the current in
the resistor, to 2.4 A.  Thus, as in the case of water flowing through
a pipe, the current in the resistor is proportional to the potential
difference across the resistor.
</p>

<p>As in the fluid flow case, one defines the resistance R of the
resistor by 
</p>

<div class="equation"><i><font
face="symbol">I</font></i> = (1/<i>R</i>) <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>.</div>

<p>Solving for <i>R</i>, this equation becomes
</p>

<div class="equation"><i>R</i> = (<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>)/<i><font
face="symbol">I</font></i>.</div>

<p>The SI-unit of electrical resistance is the <i>ohm</i>, symbol: <font
face="symbol">W</font>.  A resistor that requires a potential
difference of 100 V to produce a current of 2 A has a resistance of
100/2 = 50 <font face="symbol">W</font>.
