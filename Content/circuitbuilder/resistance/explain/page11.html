<div class="title">Resistance</div>

<p>The two circuits, the top one with a single bulb and the bottom one
with two bulbs in parallel (both identical to the top bulb), are
identical to the circuits shown on Pages 9 and 10, except that in the
bottom circuit ammeters have been inserted into the parallel branches.
The readings of these meters confirm that the current in each bulb in
the parallel set-up is identical to that of the single bulb in the top
circuit.  Adding a second bulb in parallel to the first one does not
change the conditions affecting the first bulb.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  What happens to the potential difference across
and the current in the first bulb in the bottom circuit if the second
bulb is not identical to but different from it?  Try it by changing
the design voltage of the second bulb from 6 V to 3 V (by selecting
the Select Tool and then clicking on the second bulb and changing the
design voltage in the display below).
</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The conditions affecting the first bulb do <b>not</b>
change.  If you have changed the second bulb correctly, the current in
it is increased from 0.6 A to 2.4 A and the total current in the
circuit from 1.2 A to 3.0 A, but the potential difference across and
the current in the first bulb are unchanged, 6 V and 0.6 A,
respectively.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  What is the resistance of the parallel
combination of the two bulbs now?  The first bulb has a resistance of
10 <font face="symbol">W</font> and the second one now has a
resistance of 2.5 <font face="symbol">W</font>.  (See the display of
values when the bulb is selected.)
</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The resistance <i>R</i> of the parallel combination
of the two bulbs is
</p>

<div class="equation"><i>R</i> = (<font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>)/<i><font
face="symbol">I</font></i><spacer type="horizontal" size="5"> = (6
V)/(3 A) = 2 <font face="symbol">W</font>.
</div>

<p>In general, if two resistors are connected in parallel whose
resistances are <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>2</sub>, the
resistance <i>R</i> of the parallel combination is given by the
equation
</p>

<div class="equation">1/<i>R</i> = 1/<i>R</i><sub>1</sub> +
1/<i>R</i><sub>2</sub> .</div>

<p>You may want to try to prove this general theorem.  Let's verify
it for the case considered here.  For <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> = 10 <font
face="symbol">W</font> and <i>R</i><sub>2</sub> = 2.5 <font
face="symbol">W</font> it gives
</p>

<div class="equation">1/<i>R</i> = 1/10 + 1/2.5  =  O.5 <font
face="symbol">W</font><sup>-1</sup>. </div>

<p>Thus, <i>R</i> = 2 <font face="symbol">W</font>, as above.
