<div class="title">The Concept of Resistance</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The tanker truck at the top will fill twice as fast
as the one at the bottom.  The reason is that the elevation change of
the top pipe is twice that of the bottom pipe.  This causes the water
to move twice as fast in the top pipe.  Water current is proportional
to change in elevation.
</p>

<p>However, the current in the pipe does not only depend on the change
in elevation along the pipe.  It also depends on how much resistance
there is to water flow through the pipe.  A pipe with smaller diameter
will allow less water to flow per unit time, for a given change in
elevation.  One says it has more <i>resistance</i>.
</p>

<p>One <b>defines</b> the resistance, <i>R</i>, of a pipe by
</p>
<div class="equation"><i><font face="symbol">I</font></i><spacer
type="horizontal" size="5"> = (1/<i>R</i>) <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>.
</div>

<p>Here, <i><font face="symbol">I</font></i><spacer type="horizontal"
size="5"> is the current and <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> is
the change in gravitational potential.  (Gravitational potential is
the same as the change in elevation except for a constant factor.  See
Gravitational Potential under Get Info.)
</p>

<p>Note that this equation says that <i><font
face="symbol">I</font></i><spacer type="horizontal" size="5"> is
proportional to <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>, which is as it
should be.  However, since <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> is
<b>divided</b> rather than multiplied by <i>R</i>, <R</i> is defined
so that <font face="symbol"><i>I</i></font><spacer type="horizontal"
size="5"> is <b>inversely</b> proportional to <i>R</i>.  This is so
because resistance should be defined so that for a larger resistance
one gets a smaller current.
