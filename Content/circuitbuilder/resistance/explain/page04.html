<div class="title">Ohm's Law</div>

<p>In the simulation on the left, the current in a resistor and the
potential difference across it are proportional to each other.  You
can check this by varying the battery emf and observing <font
face="symbol">D</font>V and <i><font face="symbol">I</font></i><spacer
type="horizontal" size="5"> for the resistor.
</p>

<p>This means that the resistance of the resistor, <i>R</i> = (<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>)/<i><font
face="symbol">I</font></i><spacer type="horizontal" size="5">, is
constant.  The statement that <i>R</i> is constant as the current is
varied is known as <b>Ohm's Law</b>.
</p>

<p>Metals obey Ohm's Law, as long as the temperature is constant.  As
the temperature increases, the resistance of a metal increases.  Below
a certain temperature, some metals have no resistance at all and are
then said to be <i>superconducting</i>.  Thus, metals do not obey
Ohm's law if one allows their temperature to vary.
</p>

<p>The variation of temperature and resistance is very noticeable in
light bulbs.  The resistance of a light bulb increases quite a bit as
the current increases from when the filament is glowing red to when
it is white hot.
</p>

<p>Our electric circuit simulation assumes that all circuit elements,
wires, resistors, batteries, <b>and</b> light bulbs obey Ohm's Law.
For light bulbs this is quite unrealistic, but this technicality is
not important for learning the concepts that the simulation is
designed to teach.  It would only complicate matters, unnecessarily,
to treat light bulbs more realistically. (It would also make the
simulation quite a bit harder to program.)
</p>

<p>Note that one defines the resistance of a circuit element as
<i>R</i> = (<font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>)/<i><font
face="symbol">I</font></i><spacer type="horizontal" size="5">, whether
<i>R</i> is constant or not, and that this equation must be
distinguished from Ohm's Law.  
</p>

<p>Ohm's Law is often stated in the form
</p>

<div class="equation"><font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> = <i>R<font
face="symbol">I</font></i><spacer type="horizontal"
size="5">.</div>

<p>However, this equation is really no more than the <b>definition</b>
of resistance.  Therefore, the equation is correct whether <i>R</i> is
constant or not.  However, if <i>R</i> <b>is</b> constant or,
equivalently, if <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> and <i><font
face="symbol">I</font></i><spacer type="horizontal" size="5"> are
proportional to each other, then the circuit element obeys Ohm's Law.
