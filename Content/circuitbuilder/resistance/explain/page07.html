<div class="title">Voltage Dividers</div>

<p>The simulation shows a 4-<font face="symbol">W</font> and an
8-<font face="symbol">W</font> resistor in series.  According to the
theorem on Page 6, the resistance of this series combination is 4 + 8
= 12 <font face="symbol">W</font>.  This is born out by the ammeter
reading of 1.0 A.  The current in the resistors should be equal to the
ratio (total potential difference)/(total resistance) = (12 V)/(12
<font face="symbol">W</font>) = 1 A.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  How would you calculate the potential differences
across the resistors as shown by the voltmeters?
</p>

<p class="hint">Hint: According to Kirchhoff's loop rule (voltage
law), the potential differences across two resistors in series should
add up to the total potential difference across the series
combination, which in this case is equal to the battery emf of 12 V.
This is one condition. Can you think of another condition that the two
potential differences must satisfy?  (Note that the currents in the
voltmeters are negligible because voltmeters have very high internal
resistances. Thus, the presence of the meters does not affect the
conditions in the circuit.)
