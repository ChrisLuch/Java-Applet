<div class="title">Resistors In Series</div>

<p>The illustration at the bottom shows (i) two identical pipes of
length a <i>in series</i>, i.e., connected so that all the water
leaving one pipe enters the next pipe and (ii) the corresponding
electrical analog with two light bulbs in series.
</p>

<p>The illustration at the top shows similar circuits, but with only
one pipe of length a or one light bulb, respectively.  The changes in
potential (gravitational or electric) between the top and bottom ends
of the pump or battery, points F and E, are the same in both
illustrations.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  If the resistance of one pipe of length a or one
light bulb is <i>R</i>, what is the resistance of the two identical
pipes or bulbs in series?
