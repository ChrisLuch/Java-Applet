<p>Your value is not correct.  

<p>Hint: The power dissipated in a resistor can be calculated if the
resistance of the resistor and either the potential difference across
or the current in the resistor are known.</p>

<p>The resistance is given as 6 <font face="symbol">W</font>, but
neither of the other two quantities are.  However, they can be
calculated.  To calculate the current, you need to first find the
total resistance of the circuit.  To calculate the potential
difference across the 6-<font face="symbol">W</font> resistor, it is
helpful to look at the arrangement as a potential divider.</p>

<p>For more background information, see Resistance and Potential (see
'Addition of Potential Difference') under Get Information.</p>
