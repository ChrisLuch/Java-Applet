<div class="title">DC Circuits</div>

<p>What is an electric circuit?  What does the word 'circuit' suggest
to you?  What are the basic elements of an electric circuit?
</p>

<p>In your Notebook, jot down a few answers to these questions.  
</p>

<p>The animation shows a circuit consisting of pipes in which a fluid
is circulating.  This kind of system is in several ways analogous to
an electric circuit (but not in all!).  The <b>fluid flow analogy</b>
will be used to answer the questions above.
</p>

In particular, the following concepts will be explained:

<ul>
<li>electric circuit</li>
<li>electric current</li>
<li>electric potential</li>
<li>source of electric potential difference</li>
<li>emf</li>
<li>resistance.</li>
</ul>
