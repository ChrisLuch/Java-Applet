<div class="title">DC Circuits</div>

<p><b>Circuit</b>.  A basic circuit is a loop in which some substance
can circulate.  In the fluid flow example on the left, fluid
circulates up through the pump, down the inclined narrow pipe, and
back to the pump in the wide horizontal pipe.
</p>

<p>In the analogous electric circuit shown here, the circulating
'fluid' consists of electrically charged particles.  The pump is a
battery, and the pipes are <i>conducting</i> metal wires, the narrow
pipe being the high-resistance wire of a heating coil (as in a toaster).
</p>

<p>Conductors are materials containing movable charged particles.
Metals are the most common example.  They contain movable
negatively charged electrons.  In a solid metal, the atoms that give
up the <b>movable</b> electrons have <b>fixed</b> positions.  They
become positively charged ions after giving up an electron to the
movable electron fluid.  Overall, the metal is neutral.
