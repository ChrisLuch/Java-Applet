<div class="title">DC Circuits</div>

<p>This session is titled "DC Circuits".  'DC' stands for 'directed
current'.  This means that the current in a circuit is always in one
direction.  If a battery is the source of potential difference in
a circuit, the currents in the circuit will be DC.
</p>

<p>In most households around the world, people are provided with
alternate currents (AC).  These are currents that alternate in
direction.  In North America, the frequency the current is 60 Hz.
This means that the current changes direction every 1/100th of a
second.  Elsewhere, the frequency is 60 Hz.
</p>

<p>As long as one is dealing only with resistors and light bulbs and
does not include capacitors and inductors in a circuit, the principles
of DC circuits can be applied without change to AC circuits, as long
as one ignores the fact that the currents are constantly changing
direction and the potential differences are constantly changing sign.
It turns out that one can work with averaged current and potential
difference values, so-called rms values, as if they were DC
quantities.
</p>

<p>Now, in your Notebook, summarize the essential features of DC
circuits, the concepts needed to deal with these circuits, and their
explanation in terms of the fluid flow analogy.  For more information
on the concepts discussed in this session, go to DC Circuits/Current,
DC Circuits/Potential, and DC Circuits/Resistance.
