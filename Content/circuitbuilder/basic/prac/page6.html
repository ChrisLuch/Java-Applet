<p><b>Potential</b>. When the pump lifts an amount of fluid
of mass m from the bottom to the top through a vertical distance h, it
increases the fluid's gravitational potential energy in lifting the
fluid, by the amount mgh.
</p>

<p>The increase in the potential energy <b>per</b> mass lifted, which
is equal to
</p>

<center>mgh/m = gh,</center>

<p>is called the <i>change in gravitational potential</i> as one goes
from the bottom to the top of the pump.
</p>

<p>Distinguish between gravitational <b>potential</b> and
gravitational <b>potential energy</b>.  If the vertical lift of the
pump is h = 5.0 m, the gravitational potential at the top of the pump
is gh = 9.8x5.0 = 49 m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-2</sup> greater than at the
bottom. Up to a constant factor, g, the change in gravitational
potential between the bottom and top of the pump is just the elevation
change.
</p>

<p>We have defined the <b>change</b> in gravitational potential.  What
about the gravitational potential itself?  Just like gravitational
potential energy, one can choose it to be zero at a convenient point.
Let that point be at the bottom of the pump.  The gravitational
potential at the top of the pump is then equal to gh = 49
m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-2</sup>.
</p>

<p>The important thing about the gravitational potential is that it is
unrelated to the mass m.  It simply characterizes points in the
circuit, no matter whether there is a mass there or not.  It is a
property of the gravitational field created by the earth.  It has a
definite value at every point in the circuit (and outside the
circuit).  This is equal to gy where y is the elevation of that point
relative to the point at the bottom of the pump.
</p>

<p>If one multiplies the potential at a point by the mass m of fluid
at that point, one gets the potential energy of the fluid mass at
that point.
</p>

<p>The concept of <b>electric</b> potential is analogous.  If a
positive charge q moves through a battery from one battery terminal to
the other, the battery does work on the charge and increases the
electric potential energy of the charge.  The change in electric
potential energy of the charge <b>per</b> charge is defined as the
<i>change in electric potential</i> as one goes from one battery
terminal to the other.  Using the fluid flow analogy, <b>electric
potential change can be visualized as elevation change</b>.
</p>

<p>Again, the electric potential (like elevation) is a quantity that
is defined at every point in an electric circuit (and at points
outside the circuit) and that is independent of any charge present at
that point.  The electric potential is a property of the electric
field that exists in the circuit and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>The SI-unit of the electric potential is the <i>volt (V)</i>.  A
9-V battery is a battery that has a 9-V potential difference between
its terminals.  Read about <i>emf</i> on Page 7.
