<div class="title">Electric Circuits</div>

<p>The animation shows the hydrologic cycle. Electric circuits are in
several basic ways like the hydrologic cycle.</p>

<p>First of all, both are circuits. Can you explain what is the
essential characteristic of a circuit?

<p>In addition, in both the hydrologic cycle and electric circuits two
fundamental conservation laws are realized. Can you think of which
ones?  (The two conservation laws realized in the two kinds of
circuits are not the same, but analogous.)

<p>After you have thought about these questions, go on to Pages 2 and
3 to compare.</p>
