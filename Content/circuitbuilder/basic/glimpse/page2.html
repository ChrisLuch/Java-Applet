<div class="title">Electric Circuits</div>

<p><b>Circuits</b>.  The essential thing about a <i>circuit</i> is
that it is a closed path.  Whatever it is that is moving in a circuit
must follow this closed path and eventually return to the starting
point and continue on from there.  Any point along the circuit can be
thought of as the starting point.</P>

<p>In the case of the hydrologic cycle, let's take the point where the
two people are as the starting point.  The stuff that is moving is the
water.  It goes downstream from there into the ocean, evaporates and
rises, moves inland, falls down in the form of rain or snow, and
eventually passes the starting point again, or comes down another
river.  (The hydrologic cyle is not the simplest kind of circuit
consisting of a single loop.  Instead, in contains many parallel
branches.  Electric circuits too can contain parallel branches.)</p>

<p>The stuff that is moving in an electric circuit is particles that
carry electric charge, e.g., electrons.</p>

<p>Now what two quantities are conserved while water is going through
the hydrologic cycle or charged particles are moving around an
electric circuit?

<p>For an answer, go to Page 3.</p>
