<p><b>Conservation Law 1: Conservation of Stuff</b>.  The 'stuff' that
is going around the circuit is conserved.  In the hydrologic cycle
this is the water, in electric circuits it is the electric charge.</p>

<p>The total amount of water on the earth is constant as the water
cycles around.  Similarly, the total amount of electric charge moving
in an electric circuit is constant as the charge moves around the
circuit.  Charged particles moving into a light bulb that is part of a
circuit and cause the bulb to light do not get 'used up' in the bulb,
but move through the bulb and emerge from the light bulb at its other
end in unchanged numbers and with the same amount of charge on
them.</p>

<p><b>Conservation Law 2: Energy Conservation</b>.  The application of
this law to the two kinds of circuits is a bit different from the
manner in which water or charge are conserved in the circuits.  In
both the hydrologic cycle and an electric circuit, energy is
continually being fed into the circuit by a kind of pump that keeps
the 'stuff' moving through the circuit, while at the same time the
energy in the circuit is being dissipated at the same rate at which it
is being fed in. Energy dissipation means that the energy in the
circuits is converted into thermal energy that then leaves the
circuits and heats the environment.</p>

<p>In the hydrologic cycle, the pump is the mechanism that uses solar
radiation to evaporate ocean water and 
increase its gravitational potential energy by raising the vapour. The source of this
energy is the sun.  The gravitational potential energy gained by the
vapour is dissipated when the vapour, after condensing into water or
snow and ice, precipitates down to the ground and ultimately moves
back into the ocean.  Also, the energy inserted into the cycle in the
evaporation process is freed up and dissipated when the vapour
condenses into liquid or solid matter later on.</p>

<p>In an electric circuit, the pump that keeps the charged particles
moving is a battery (or other power supply).  Batteries convert stored
chemical energy into eletric potential energy of the charged particles
moving through the battery.  This electric potential energy is
dissipated into thermal energy in the resistive elements in the
circuit, e.g., an electric hot plate.</p>

<p>These two conservation laws are the basic physics principles that
allow you to understand DC circuits, as well as important practical
aspects of AC circuits.  (Some aspects of AC circuits require
additional physics principles.)</p>
