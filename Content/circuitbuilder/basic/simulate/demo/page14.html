<p>There is one more useful attribute of the Select Tool that you need
to know about.  Select the Select Tool and then click on a wire
segment.  At the bottom of the display about this segment, there are
three buttons, marked with either arrows or a dash, respectively.
Click on one of the two arrow buttons.  This will let you choose a
direction in the branch of the circuit containing the wire segment.
This will be useful in applying Kirchhoff's laws when solving circuit
problems.  Clicking the button with the dash will deselect the
direction.</p>

<p>The only remaining tools are the Zoom-In Tool&nbsp;
   <img SRC="../../../images/zoomInButton.jpg" height=26 width=37 align=ABSCENTER>
and the Zoom-Out Tool&nbsp;
   <img SRC="../../../images/zoomOutButton.jpg" height=26 width=37 align=ABSCENTER>
.&nbsp; Click on these to see what effect they have on the display.

<p>All tools are now active, and you may want to experiment freely
with the simulation before quitting this demo.  You can do so also by
going to Electrical Circuits/Basic Facts/Simulate It/Practice.  There
you will have the entire window area available for the Circuit Lab
Simulation.
</p>

<p>If you point the mouse to one of the tool icons, a tool tip will
appear indicating the function of the tool.</p>
