<div class="title">Short Circuit</div>

<p>The circuit on the left is a very
basic circuit.&nbsp; It is formed by a battery (circuit
symbol:&nbsp;&nbsp;<img SRC="../../../images/batteryButtoninv.jpg" height=26
width=36 align=ABSCENTER>) and a wire loop connecting one battery
terminal to the other one.
</p>

<p>Our circuit is a <i>short circuit</i>,
which means that there is very little resistance in the circuit,
resulting in a very large current.&nbsp; In a real life short circuit
there is rapid heating and melting of the wires.&nbsp; Therefore, the
circuit simulation will show the wires in red if there is a short
circuit.&nbsp; (In reality, because of the melting of the wires, a
short-circuit will be short-lived.)
</p>

<p>The conventional current direction, the direction in which positive
charge carriers would move, is simulated.  On the outside of the battery, this
direction is from the positive pole (long bar of the battery symbol)
to the negative pole of the battery.
