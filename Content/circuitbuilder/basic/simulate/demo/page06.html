<div class="title">Batteries</div>

<p>Select the Select Tool&nbsp;<img
SRC="../../../images/arrowButton.jpg" BORDER=0 height=26 width=37
align=ABSCENTER>.&nbsp; Then click on the battery in the
circuit.&nbsp; Information about the battery will be displayed,
including its emf and its internal resistance.
</p>

<p>Their values are characteristic of the battery and do not depend on
anything else in the circuit.&nbsp Change them via the data entry
fields.  When done, click the Calculator icon to implement the new
values.  Observe how the other values on display change.
</p>

<p>The other listed quantities, the
current in the battery, the voltage across the external terminals of
the battery, and the power of conversion of chemical to electrical
energy in the battery, are not properties of the battery alone, but
depend also on the other circuit elements.
</p>

<p>You can change the polarity of the battery
so that the positive pole is on the right rather than on the left by clicking
the "Switch Polarity" button.&nbsp; Try it, and observe how the current
direction changes.
