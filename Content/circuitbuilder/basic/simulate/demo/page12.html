<div class="title">Light Bulbs Continued</div>

<p>The circuit now contains a light bulb in series with a
resistor.&nbsp; There is no current in the circuit because the switch
is open, and the bulb does not glow.
</p>

<p>Close the switch (click on the Select Tool, then on the switch;
then deselect Open Switch).&nbsp; The bulb should light up.
</p>

<p>Now double the emf of the battery. (See p.6 on how to do this.)&nbsp; Observe the
change in brightness of the light bulb.&nbsp; Try to find the emf
values at which the bulb either burns out or gets dimmed to the point
where it is no longer giving off light.
</p>

<p>Try to vary the light output of the bulb by changing the resistance
of the resistor.
</p>

<p>You can also change the design voltage and power of the bulb (click
on the Select Tool, then the bulb; etc.).&nbsp;
Observe the changes in light output.
