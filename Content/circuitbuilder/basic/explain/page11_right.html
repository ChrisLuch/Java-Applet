<p>The picture shows the essential elements of a light bulb.  The
picture shows the bulb cut open at the bottom so that you can see how
the filament is connected to the outside metal contacts.
</p>

<p>The filament is the part that gets heated by the current and emits
the light.  One end of the filament is connected to the metal thread
by which the bulb is screwed into the socket.  The other end is
connected to a metal contact at the base of the bulb.
</p>

<p>There is insulating material between the base of the bulb and the
thread so that no charges can move directly between the base and the
thread and 'short out' the filament.</p>

<p>To light the bulb, its metal thread must be connected to one pole
of the battery and the metal contact at the base to the other.  So,
given a battery and only one piece of wire, how can you make the bulb
burn?
