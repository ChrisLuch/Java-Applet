<p><b>Energy Conservation</b>.  In raising the fluid from the bottom
to the top, the pump gives it gravitational potential energy.  This
energy is dissipated in the form of heat when the fluid encounters
friction while moving through the sloping narrow pipe.  Note that
potential energy is not converted into kinetic energy as the fluid
moves down the pipe because the constancy of the current along the
pipe implies constant fluid speed, assuming the pipe's diameter is
constant.
</p>

<p>Actually, we will assume that fluid speeds are so small throughout
the circuit that the kinetic energy of the fluid is negligible
altogether.  A narrow pipe can bring this about.  For electric
circuits, it is an excellent assumption to neglect the kinetic energy
of the moving charged particles.</p>

<p><b>Related fact</b>. What do you think is the speed with which
electrically charged particles move in a typical electric circuit,
assuming they all have the same speed and all move in the same
direction?  This may surprise you, but the speed is incredibly small.
Its order of magnitude is 1 meter per <b>hour</b>!  The speed is
<b>not</b> something approaching the speed of light.  What <b>is</b>
fast is the speed with which <b>changes</b> in one part of a circuit
are transmitted to another part.  E.g., if a switch is closed in a
circuit, the electric charges in a light bulb in the circuit start
moving and the bulb starts burning almost immediately, not hours after
the switch was closed.
