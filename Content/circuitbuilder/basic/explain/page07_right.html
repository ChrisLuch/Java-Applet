<p><b>Emf</b>.  The <i>emf</i> of a battery is defined as the work
done on a charge <i>q</i> when the charge moves through the battery,
divided by <i>q</i>. (Emf stands for the quaint and misleading term
'electro-motive force.)
</p>

<p>If there is no 'friction' (internal resistance) inside the battery,
causing some of the work done by the battery to be dissipated as heat
inside the battery, the battery emf is equal to the potential
difference between the battery terminals.  If the battery does have
internal resistance, the terminal potential difference is less than
the emf.  Reason: If some of the work done by the battery on a charge
<i>q</i> is dissipated as heat inside the battery, less than the total
work done remains to increase the charge's electrical potential
energy, by energy conservation.</p>

<p>One often sees the symbol <font face="symbol">e</font> for emf.
<font face="symbol">e</font> is the Greek letter 'epsilon'.  In MAP,
emf is also denoted by <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>. The SI-unit for emf is
the same as for electric potential, namely, the volt (V).
</p>

<p>The picture illustrates a situation that can easily arise when a
car battery whose emf is 12 V is used to start up the engine.  In this
situation, when there is a current in the circuit, the battery
terminal potential difference is somewhat less than the battery emf of
12 V.  The emptier the battery gets, the smaller the terminal
potential difference will be and the less able the battery will be to
turn over the starter motor.  This is so because the internal
resistance of the battery increases as the battery gets emptier.  The
emf always remains equal to 12 V.
