<div class="title">Electric Circuits</div>

<p><b>Potential</b>. When the pump lifts an amount of fluid of mass
<i>m</i> from the bottom to the top through a vertical distance
<i>h</i>, it increases the fluid's gravitational potential energy by
the amount <i>mgh</i>.  We will need another quantity, the
<i>gravitational potential</i>, which is related to the gravitational
potential energy and defined as follows.
</p>

<p>The increase in the potential energy <b>per</b> unit mass lifted,
which is equal to
</p>

<div class="equation"><i>mgh</i>/<i>m</i> = <i>gh</i>,</div>

<p>is called the <i>change in gravitational potential</i> as one goes
from the bottom to the top of the pump.
</p>

<p>Distinguish between gravitational <b>potential</b> and
gravitational <b>potential energy</b>!  If the vertical lift of the
pump is <i>h</i> = 5.0 m, the gravitational potential at the top of
the pump is by <i>gh</i> = 9.8x5.0 = 49 m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-2</sup>
(or 49 J/kg) greater than at the bottom. The change in gravitational
potential between the bottom and top of the pump is nothing but the
elevation change, except for the constant factor <i>g</i>.
</p>

<p>We have defined the <b>change</b> in gravitational potential.  What
about the gravitational potential itself?  Just like gravitational
potential energy, one can choose it to be zero at a convenient point.
Let that point be at the bottom of the pump.  The gravitational
potential at the top of the pump is then equal to <i>gh</i> = 49
m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-2</sup>.
</p>

<p>Here is an important feature of the gravitational potential: it
does not depend on the mass <i>m</i>.  The potential characterizes
points in the fluid circuit, no matter whether there is a mass there
or not.  It is a property of the gravitational field created by the
earth.  It has a definite value at every point in the circuit (and
outside the circuit).  If one takes the potential to be zero at the
bottom of the pump, the gravitational potential at a point of
elevation <i>y</i> relative to the bottom of the pump is equal to
<i>gy</i>.</p>

<p>If one multiplies the potential at a point by the mass <i>m</i> of
of a fluid particle at that point, one gets the potential energy of
the fluid particle at that point.
</p>

<p>The concept of <b>electric</b> potential is analogous.  If a
positive charge <i>q</i> moves through a battery from one battery
terminal to the other, the battery does work on the charge and
increases the electric potential energy of the charge.  The change in
electric potential energy <b>per</b> unit charge, as charge moves from
one battery terminal to the other, is defined as the <i>change in
electric potential</i> as one goes from one terminal to the other.
Using the fluid flow analogy, <b>electric potential change can be
visualized as elevation change</b>.
</p>

<p>Again, the electric potential (like elevation) is a quantity that
is defined at every point in an electric circuit (and at points
outside the circuit) and that is independent of any charge present at
that point.  The electric potential is a property of the electric
field present in the circuit and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>The SI-unit of the electric potential is the <i>volt (V)</i>.  A
9-V battery is a battery that has a 9-V potential difference between
its terminals.  Read about <i>emf</i> on Page 7.
