<p>All circuits on the preceding pages were simple loops. Circuits can
also have branches.  An example of a fluid flow circuit with two
parallel branches, the pipes labeled 'c', is illustrated on the left
above.  The circuit diagram for an analogous electric circuit is
illustrated on the right.</p>

<p>Both circuits contain four resistive segments, labeled 'a', 'b',
'c' and 'c'.  Because of mass or charge conservation, the current in
each of the identical segments c must be half that in segment a or
b. The current in segment b is split into two equal portions upon
leaving segment b and entering the two segments c.</p>
