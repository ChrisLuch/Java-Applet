<p><b>Resistance</b>.  What determines the magnitude of the current in
the fluid flow circuit shown on the left?  Let's assume the pump moves
just enough fluid to the higher elevation to supply what is drained
away from that point by the sloping narrow pipe.  In other words, the
pump is not putting pressure on the fluid at the entrance to the
sloping pipe.  This situation corresponds to the electric case.
</p>

<p>The agent that moves the fluid through the narrow pipe is gravity,
and the rate at which gravity is able to move fluid through the narrow
pipe determines the magnitude of the current in the entire circuit.
One says the pipe has <i>resistance</i>.  (Let us assume that the
horizontal pipe is quite wide and resistance-less and therefore does
not need to be sloped.)
</p>

<p>The resistance of the narrow pipe is defined so that it is
inversely proportional to the current in the pipe.  You will agree
that the current will be smaller and therefore the resistance greater
if the pipe is made narrower or longer.  One can show that the
resistance is proportional to the length of the pipe.</p>  

<p>The resistance is due to friction and causes the potential energy
of the fluid to be dissipated in the pipe in the form of heat as the
fluid moves through the pipe.
</p>

<p>Similar to the fluid circuit shown, in the electric circuit
illustrated here the wires and battery have negligible resistance,
but the heating coil is made of different material and has quite a bit
of resistance.  Therefore, the coil determines the magnitude of the
current in the circuit (given the battery emf), and all of the
electric potential energy gained by charge when moving through the
battery is given up by the charge and converted into heat as the
charge moves through the resistive coil.
