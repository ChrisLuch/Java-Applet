<div class="title">Electric Circuits</div>

<p>Physicists (and electrical engineers) use schematic <b>circuit
diagrams</b>, like the one at bottom left, to represent the circuit
represented by the more realistic looking drawing at top left.
</p>

<p>The symbol with the long and short bar represents a battery.  The
long bar represents the terminal with higher potential (the so-called
'positive' pole) and the short bar the terminal with the lower
potential (the 'negative' pole). (The battery symbol is misleading
because it looks as if the circuit is interrupted inside the battery.
This is not the case in reality.  Charges can move inside the battery
from one terminal to the other.)  The straight lines are wires, and
you will be able to recognize the light bulb.
</p>

<p>The schematic diagram does not indicate how wires must be connected
to a real light bulb, with its thread on the side and metal contact at
the base.  So, it can be challinging in the lab to connect the
elements of a circuit as indicated in a circuit diagram.</b>  

<p>Nevertheless, circuit diagrams are extremely useful.  For example,
the diagram here shows that a light bulb has <b>two</b> contact
points, not one.  It does not indicate that the circuit is continued
inside the bulb from one contact point to the other.  Neither does the
battery symbol indicate that the circuit is continued inside the
battery, via the conducting battery fluid.  Thus, it takes a bit of
practice to interpret schematic circuit diagrams correctly.  They are
not the whole story.
