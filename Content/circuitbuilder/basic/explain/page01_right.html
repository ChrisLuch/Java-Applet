<p><b>Preparation</b>: Electric Circuits/Basic Facts/Get A Glimpse.</p>

<p>What is an electric circuit?  What does the word 'circuit' suggest
to you?  What are the basic elements of an electric circuit? In your
Notebook, jot down a few answers to these questions.
</p>

<p>The animation on the left shows another kind of circuit, consisting
of pipes in which a fluid is circulating.  This kind of system is in
several ways analogous to an electric circuit (but not in all!).  You
will learn in this session how the <b>fluid flow analogy</b> can help
answer the questions above.
</p>

In particular, the following concepts will be explained in terms of
the fluid flow analogy:
