<div class="title">Electric Circuits</div>

<p>The remaining pages in this session are based on the preceding
material and will deal with some practical considerations involving
electric circuits.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  Suppose you have a battery, a light bulb, and a
metal wire.  How can you connect the three together so that the bulb
will light?
</p>

<p>Three suggestions are shown on the left.  Which one(s) will work?
</p>

<p>Hint: For a bulb to burn, there must be a current in the bulb,
i.e., electric charges must be moving into the bulb at one end and out
the other.  The next page will give some relevant information about
what light bulbs look like on the inside.
