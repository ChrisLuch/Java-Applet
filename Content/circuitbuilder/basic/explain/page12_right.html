<p>Only one of the three arrangements on Page 10 will make the bulb
burn: arrangement (c) shown here.  The reason will now be explained.
</p>

<p>Electric current consists of moving electric charge.  To have a
current in the filament, electric charge must move into the bulb at
contact point B and out at contact point C, or the other way around.
(The direction in which charge moves depends on whether it is positive
or negative and on how the battery is connected.)
</p>

<p>The reason why charge that goes into the bulb must again come out
of the bulb is that <b>electric charge is conserved</b>.  Conservation
of electric charge is a fundamental law of nature.  If charge were not
conserved, charge might go into the bulb at contact B and not come out
at contact C.  It could get 'used up' in the bulb.  However, this is
not what happens.  Charge simply moves <b>through</b> the bulb,
without any loss or gain in amount.
</p>

<p>For the same reason, the battery cannot create or destroy charge.
The role of the battery is to keep charge moving through the circuit
and supply the energy that gets dissipated in the bulb in the form of
heat and light.  To be able to move the charge through the circuit and
the bulb, the battery be connected as shown in the picture.
</p>

<p>After leaving the bulb at C, the charge enters the battery at C,
from there moves inside the battery to A and then through the wire
back to B.  Thus, electric charge moves in a closed loop, from C to A
to B and back to C.  Such a closed loop is called an <i>electric
circuit</i>.  For a steady electric current to exist in the bulb
filament, the filament must be part of a circuit, as in arrangement
(c).  The circuit must also contain a 'charge-moving agent' like a
battery.
