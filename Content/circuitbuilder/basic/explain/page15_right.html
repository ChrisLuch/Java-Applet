<p><b>DC vs. AC Circuits</b></p>

<p>The electric circuits on the preceding pages have all been <i>DC
Circuits</i>.  'DC' stands for 'directed current'.  This means that the
current in such a circuit is always in one direction.  If a battery is
the source of potential difference in a circuit, the currents in the
circuit will be DC.
</p>

<p>In most households around the world, people are provided with
<i>alternating currents</i> (AC currents).  These are currents that
alternate in direction.  In North America, the frequency of household
currents is 60 Hz.  This means that the current changes direction
every 1/120th of a second and goes through a complete cycle 60 times
every second.  In many other parts of the world, the frequency is 50
Hz.
</p>

<p>As long as a circuit includes only resistors and light bulbs and no
capacitors and inductors, the principles of DC circuits can be applied
without change to AC circuits, provided one ignores the fact that the
currents and potential differences are constantly changing sign.  It
turns out that one can deal with such AC circuits simply by using
averaged current and potential difference values, so-called <i>rms
values</i>, as if they were DC quantities.  The 120-V AC potential
difference supplied to North American households is such an rms
potential difference.

<p>Now, in your Notebook, summarize the essential features of electric
circuits, the concepts needed to deal with these circuits, and their
explanation in terms of the fluid flow analogy.  In particular, note
which aspects of circuits depend on mass or charge conservation and on
energy conservation.</p>

<p>To get more into the details of the concepts touched on in this
session, work through the Circuit Lab Demo in Electric Circuits/Basic
Facts/Simulate It/Demo and then go to

<br>Electric Circuits/Current,

<br>Electric Circuits/Potential, and

<br>Electric Circuits/Resistance.
