<p><b>Think About It</b>.  Each of the two in-parallel bulbs in the
bottom circuit has a potential difference of <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>/3
across it.  This is less than the <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>/2 potential
difference across either one of the bulbs in the top circuit.  Thus,
the two in-parallel bulbs in the bottom circuit are less bright than
the bulbs in the top circuit.  The simulation shows this.
