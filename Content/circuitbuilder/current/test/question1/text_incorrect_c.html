<div class="title">Incorrect</div>

<p>
You picked choice (c), saying that bulb <b>B</b> will burn less bright
than bulb <b>A</b>.
</p>

<p>Maybe your reasoning was that there is a total amount of power
available that is shared among three bulbs in the bottom circuit, not
just among two as in the top circuit.  One cannot reason this way
because the power dissipated in a circuit depends on the configuration
of the circuit.
</p>

<p>Hint: In the top circuit, bulb A is in a series with a single bulb,
identical to A.  In the bottom circuit, bulb B is in series with a
parallel combination of two bulbs identical to B (and A).
</p>

<p>What is the resistance of these two bulbs in parallel?  Is it
greater than, equal to, or less than that of a single bulb?
