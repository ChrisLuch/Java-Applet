<p><b>Set It Up and Solve It</b>.  Let the common resistance of bulbs
A and B be <i>R</i>.  In the top circuit, bulb A has another bulb of
the same resistance <i>R</i> in series with it.  Thus the potential
difference across each bulb is <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>/2.
</p>

<p>The resistance of the combination of two in-parallel bulbs in the
bottom circuit is <b>less</b> than <i>R</i>.  In fact, it is equal to
<i>R</i>/2.  (See Resistance under Get Information.  You will find an
equation that lets you calculate this resistance.  You can also review
the theory of in-parallel resistors in Electric
Circuits/Resistance/Explain It.)
</p>

<p>The potential differences across resistors in series are
proportional to the respective resistances.  Thus, in the bottom
circuit, the potential difference across bulb B is twice that across
the in-parallel combination of bulbs, or (2/3)<i>V<sub>0</sub></i> across
bulb B vs. (1/3)<i>V<sub>0</sub></i> across the in-parallel
combination.  (2/3)<i>V<sub>0</sub></i> is more than the
(1/2)<i>V<sub>0</sub></i> across bulb A.  Thus, bulb B burns
brighter.
