<div class="title">Making A Light Bulb Burn</div>

<p>
<b>Correct!</b></p> 

<p>To have the bulb burn, there must be electric current in its
filament.  Electric current consists of moving electric charge.  To
have a current in the filament, electric charge must move into the
bulb at contact point B and out at contact point C, or the other way
around.</p>

<p>The reason why charge that goes into the bulb must again come out
of the bulb is that <b>electric charge is conserved</b>.  Conservation
of electric charge is a fundamental law of nature.  If charge were not
conserved, charge might go into the bulb at contact B and get 'used
up' in lighting the bulb.  If that were so, the charge would not come
out at contact point C and we would not need to connect point C to the
battery.</p>

<p>See Page 2 for what happens to the charge inside the battery.</p>
