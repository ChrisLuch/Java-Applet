<div class="title">Electric Current</div>

<p class="subtitle">Definition</p>

<p>Electric current is a quantity that is defined at every point in a
circuit and can have different values at different points in a circuit
(in different branches of a circuit).  Imagine a cross section through
a circuit element (wire, resistor, battery, etc.) at a given point of
a circuit.  The <i>current <font face="symbol">I</font></i> at that
point is defined as the rate in time at which electric charge is
crossing the cross section at that point, i.e., as the ratio
</p>

<div class="equation"><i><font face="symbol">I</font></i> =
d<i>Q</i>/d<i>t</i></div>

<p>where d<i>Q</i> is the amount of charge passing through the cross
section in the interval d<i>t</i>.
</p>

<p>The SI-unit of current is the <i>ampere</i> (short form:
<i>amp</i>), which has the symbol 'A'.
</p>

<p>If an amount of charge d<i>Q</i> = 2.4x10<sup>-4</sup> C passes a
given point in a time interval d<i>t</i> = 1.2x10<sup>-3</sup> s, the
current at that point is equal to
</p>

<div class="equation"><i><font face="symbol">I</font></i> =
(2.4x10<sup>-4</sup>)/(1.2x10<sup>-3</sup>) = 0.2 A .</div>

<p class="subtitle">Kirchhoff's Junction Rule (Current Law)</p>

<p>At a junction (node) in a circuit, the sum of the currents going
into the junction is equal to the sum of the currents leaving the
junction.  
</p>

<p>This law is a consequence of electric charge conservation.  The
amount of charge going into a junction is equal to the amount coming
out, in a given time interval.
