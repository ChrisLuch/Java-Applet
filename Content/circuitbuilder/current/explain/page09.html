<div class="title">Electric Current</div>

<p><b>Explanation</b>: In the fluid flow analogy, a pump (battery)
elevates the fluid (charge) from E to F by equal amounts (6-V potential
difference) in both circuits.
</p>

<p>From point F, the fluid (charge) moves downhill (decreasing
potential) through the bulb(s).  A single bulb is represented by a
narrow pipe of length <i>a</i>.  You can see that two pipes of total
length 2<i>a</i> (two bulbs in series) will be sloped less than a
single pipe of length <i>a</i> if the vertical drop of the pipes is
the same in both cases.
</p>

<p>Less slope means the fluid will move downhill more slowly which
means that the current will be smaller in the bottom circuit, which is
what we wanted to explain.
</p>

<p><b>Important note</b>.  The fluid current in a given pipe is
proportional to the elevation change.  Similarly, the electric current
in a given bulb is proportional to the electric potential difference
across the bulb.
