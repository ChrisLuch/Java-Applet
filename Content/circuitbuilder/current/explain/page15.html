<div class="title">Electric Current</div>

<p>On the left are shown are two identical circuits with identical
bulbs.  Bulbs 2 and 3 are connected in parallel, and this parallel
combination is connected in series with bulb 1.  There are three
switches in the circuits.  The only difference in the two circuits is
in the states of the switches, whether they are open or closed.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  When you close the open switch in the top
circuit, how will the three bulbs in the top circuit burn compared to
those in the bottom circuit?  Think about this and then check your
answer by closing the switch.
</p>

<p>Suggestion: You may want to insert ammeters in both circuits to
measure the currents in all bulbs.  This requires three meters per
circuit.  Meters show more clearly than the bulbs' brightness how
large the currents are in each bulb.
