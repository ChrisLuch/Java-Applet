<div class="title">Electric Current</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  All bulbs burn equally bright, which is consistent
with the fact that the current in the bulb in the top circuit is the
same as the current in each bulb in the bottom circuit, as indicated
by meters 2 and 3.
</p>

<p>In addition, you can observe that meter 1 shows twice as much
current as either meter 2 or 3.
</p>

<p><b>Task</b>: Try to explain these observations in terms of the
fluid flow analogy of an electric circuit.
