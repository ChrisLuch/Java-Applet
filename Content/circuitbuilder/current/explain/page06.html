<div class="title">Electric Current</div>

<p>The ammeter must be inserted <i>in series</i> with the bulb to
measure the current in the bulb.  This way the current is the same in
both the meter and the bulb because the same amount of charge moves
through the meter every second as through the bulb.  Remember that
charge is conserved (cannot be created or destroyed) and that, in the
steady state, it does not accumulate at any point in the cirucuit.
</p>

<p>The ammeter shows a current of 0.6 A (ampere; or 'amp' for short).
This means that 0.6 coulomb of charge pass through the meter (and the
bulb) every second.
</p>

<div class="definition"><b>Definition</b>

<p>The magnitude of a current at a point in a circuit is defined to be
1 ampere (A) if 1 Coulomb (C) of charge passes that point in 1 second
(s),
</p>

<div class="equation">1 A = 1 C/s.</div>
