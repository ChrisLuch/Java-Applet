    <div class="title">Gravitational Field Outside and Inside a Uniform
    Sphere</div>

    <p>The Applet on Page 2 simulates the gravitational field outside and
    inside a sphere of uniform mass density.  In another mode, the applet
    simulates the electric field outside and inside a sphere of uniform
    charge density.

    <p>Detailed information on how to use the applet is available from
    Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
