 <div class="title">Electric Field Outside and Inside a Uniform
 Sphere</div>

 <p>The Applet on Page 2 simulates the electric field outside and
 inside a sphere of uniform charge density.  In another mode, the applet
 simulates the gravitational field outside and inside a sphere of uniform
 mass density.

 <p>The applet will be loaded in its default mode, which is the
 Gravitational mode.  To set it to the Electric mode, click the radio
 button labeled "Electric".

 <p>Detailed information on how to use the applet is available from
 Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
