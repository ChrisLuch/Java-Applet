 Charges</center></div>

 <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the electric field and the
 corresponding equipotential lines (curves) accompanying two electric
 charges.  The applet displays the electric field vectors due to the
 individual charges as well as the combined field vector, thus
 demonstrating the superposition of field vectors. The locations of
 the charges and the charge amounts can be varied.

 <p>A dipole mode can be chosen in which the charges are automatically
 equal in magnitude and opposite in sign and in which the magnitude of
 the electric dipole moment is constant as the amounts of charge or
 the separation of the charges are varied.

 <p>For detailed information on how to use the applet, please see
 under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
