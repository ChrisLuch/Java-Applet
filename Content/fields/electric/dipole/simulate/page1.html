        <div class="title"><center>Electric Field Accompanying Two Electric
        Charges</center></div>

        <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the electric field and the
        corresponding equipotential lines (curves) accompanying two electric
        charges.  The applet displays the electric field vectors due to the
        individual charges as well as the combined field vector, thus
        demonstrating the superposition of field vectors. The locations of
        the charges and the charge amounts can be varied.

        <p>A dipole mode can be chosen in which the charges are automatically
        equal in magnitude and opposite in sign and in which the magnitude of
        the electric dipole moment is constant as the amounts of charge or
        the separation of the charges are varied.

        <p>For detailed information on how to use the applet, please see
        under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
