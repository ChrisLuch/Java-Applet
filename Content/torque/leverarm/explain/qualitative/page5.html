<div class="title">The Lever Arm</div>

<p>Point B where the 200-N force is acting has been moved to the right
compared to where it was on Page 4.  The beam is now balanced.  Check
it by clicking RELEASE.
</p>

<p>The lever arm is indicated in green.  The blue line indicates the
lever arm that we had on Page 3, where the system was balanced when
the 200-N force was <b>vertical</b>.  Note that the green and blue
lines have the same lengths.  That must be so if both times the 200-N
force is to balance the 100-kg weight.  It must have the same torque
at both times.  (Torque = force x lever arm.)
</p>

<p>When first learning about torques and lever arms, students often
take the line segment from the rotation axis to the point where the
force is applied, O to B in the present situation, as the lever arm.
This is <b>not</b> the lever arm when the force has the direction
shown.  The lever arm is shorter than the the segment OB.
</p>

<p>The lever arm is always <b>perpendicular</b> to the force.</p>
