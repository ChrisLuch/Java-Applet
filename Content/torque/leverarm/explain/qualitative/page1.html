<div class="title">The Lever Arm</div>

<p>The diagram shows a force vector, in mustard color, and a rotation
axis perpendicular to the screen through point O, in red.  The point
at which the force is acting, in blue, is at the tail end of the force
vector.  The corresponding lever arm is shown in green.  The dotted
line is the 'line along which the force is acting'.
</p>

<p>You can vary the following by dragging:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>position of rotation axis</li>
  <li>force vector (drag its tip)</li>
  <li>point at which force is applied.</li>
</ul>

<p>Observe how the lever arm changes.
