<div class="title">The Lever Arm</div>

<p>You can see a force vector and a rotation axis.  The following
sequence will take you through the construction of the lever arm for
this situation.  The lever arm depends on both the force vector and
where it acts in relation to the axis.
</p>

<p><u>Step 1</u>.  Draw the line along which the force is acting.
To do this, click STEP 1.
</p>

<p><u>Step 2</u>.  Drop the perpendicular from the axis onto the line
along which the force is acting.  To do this, click STEP 2.  The
perpendicular, in green, is the lever arm.
</p>

<p>To repeat the sequence with a different force, click NEW FORCE.
