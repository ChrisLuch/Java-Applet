<div class="title">The Lever Arm</div>

<p>The turning effect of a force is not determined by the magnitude
of the force, but by its torque,
</p>

<p class="equation">torque = force x lever arm. </p>

<p>Thus, even a small force can have a large turning effect (torque)
if its lever arm is large enough.  (Note that torques and forces are
vectors, and that 'torque' and 'force' in the equation above denote
the magnitudes of these vectors, not the vectors themselves.)
</p>

<p>In the situation on the left, there are two forces trying to turn
the beam, the 1000-N force due to the 100-kg ball (taking g = 10 m
s<sup>-2</sup>) and the applied 200-N force.  The 1000-N and 200-N
forces are trying to turn the beam clockwise and counter-clockwise,
respectively.
</p>

<p>Right now, Point B is chosen so that the two torques balance.  If
you click RELEASE, the beam will not turn.  For this to be true, the
lever arm of the 200-N force, shown in green, must be 5 times as long
as the lever arm of the 1000-N force, shown in red.
