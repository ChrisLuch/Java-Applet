<div class="title">The Lever Arm</div>

<p>Point B is in exactly the same position as on p.3, where the beam
was balanced.  However, now the 200-N force is not acting vertically,
but at an angle.  This changes the lever arm, and therefore the torque
due to the 200-N force.  The torque due to the ball is unchanged.  As
a result, the beam is no longer balanced.
</p>

<p>Can you predict which way the beam will turn?  Think about it and then
check your prediction by clicking RELEASE.
</p>

<p>Then try to find the position in which the beam is balanced.  When
done, go on to the next page to compare.
