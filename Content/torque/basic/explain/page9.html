<div class="title">Torque and Rotation</div>

<p>The motion of any rigid object can be thought of as a combination
of a translational motion of the CM of the object and a rotation of
the object around the CM.</p>

<p>You may never have thought of a pendulum's motion this way.  It
seems much easier to think of this motion as a pure rotation around the
axis through O.  Nevertheless, it is instructive to think of the
pendulum's motion as a translation of the CM and rotation around the
CM.  Only this point of view will allow you to understand and
calculate the force of constraint exerted by the axle on the rod at
point O.

<p>The force of constraint creates a torque about the CM that causes
the pendulum bob to rotate about the CM.  The gravitational force does
not create a torque about the CM and does not make the bob rotate
around the CM.</p>  

<p>In addition, the CM undergoes accelerated translational motion.
This acceleration is determined by the net force, the sum of the
gravitational force and the constraint force exerted by the axle.
Without the constraint force, the bob's acceleration would be
vertically downward.  You can display the acceleration of the CM by
selecting button 2.  The acceleration is represented by the blue
arrow.  It is anything but downward!  (The green arrow represents the
velocity of the CM.)
</p>

<p>Note that the force of constraint exerted by the axle on the rod is
a complicated force that changes both in direction and magnitude
during the pendulum's motion.</p>

<p>Now, in your Notebook, express in your own words how forces can
affect the motion of objects and under what conditions an object will
start rotating or change its state of rotation.
