<div class="title">Torque and Rotation</div>

<p>On Pages 1 to 7, you could observe how an object will respond to
one or two applied forces if the object is allowed to move freely.  On
the remaining two pages, you will be able to observe the response of a
<i>constrained</i> object, in this case an object that is constrained
to rotate around a fixed axis.</p>

<p>The object is a <i>physical pendulum</i> consisting of a flat disk
rigidly attached to a rigid massless rod.  The pendulum can oscillate
in the plane of the screen around an axis perpendicular to the screen
through the fixed point O.</p>

<p>When you select button 1, the forces acting on the pendulum will be
displayed by red arrows.  One force acting on the pendulum is the
gravitational force. The gravitational force can be thought of as
acting at the object's CM.  Will there be any other forces acting on
the pendulum?  What do you think?</p>

<p><b>Question</b>: What would be the pendulum's motion if the
gravitational force were the only force acting on it?</p>  

<p><b>Answer</b>: The pendulum would fall straight down without any
change in the orientation of the rod.  The motion would be like that
of the object on Page 4, if you set the initial velocity of that
object equal to zero.  (Drag the red velocity vector until its length
is zero.)</p>

<p>Of course, this is not what will happen to the pendulum if its rod
continues to be supported at O.  Now click the PLAY button, with
button 1 selected so that you can observe both the motion of the
pendulum and the forces acting on the pendulum.</p>

<p>Are the two forces that are acting on the pendulum, the
gravitational force acting at the CM and the force that the axle
support exerts on the rigid rod at point O, consistent with the
pendulum's oscillatory motion?</p>

<p>You may want to increase the radius of the disk substantially, to
something like 4 m.  Use the data entry field for the radius.  You can
also drag the bob to a different initial position and change the
length <i>l</i> of the pendulum this way.  The magnitude and direction
of the constraint force, especially at the moment when the pendulum is
released, will become more apparent when you make the bob's radius
very large.</p>
