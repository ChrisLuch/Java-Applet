<div class="title">Torque and Rotation</div>

<p>The quantity that causes rotation, or, more accurately, angular
acceleration, is called <i>torque</i>.  Here, a few observations
related to torque will be presented.  Explanations will be given
elsewhere.  The goal right now is to just observe the relationship
between torque and rotation.</p>

<p>However, before observing the actual motion, drag the force vector
around in the object, and observe the value of the corresponding
torque.  The value is printed at the bottom of the applet area.  (Note
that the torque that we are dealing with here is the torque <b>about
the CM</b>.  Elsewhere, we will also consider torques about other
points.)</p>

<p>Observe that the torque is positive when the force is acting at a
point to the left of the CM and negative when acting at a point to the
right of the CM.  The magnitude of the torque increases in proportion
to how far the force is away from the CM in the horizontal direction.
This horizontal offset of the force is called the <i>lever arm</i>.
(The lever arm is horizontal because the force is vertical.  When the
force is not vertical, the lever arm will not be horizontal.)</p>

<p>PLAY the simulation and observe the rotation of the object when the
point at which the force is acting is to the left or to the right of
the CM.  The motion is again shown in the CM frame.
</p>

<p>When the motion is started with the force acting at a point to the
left of the CM, the rotation is counter-clockwise at first and its
rate is increasing.  The torque is positive in this case. What you
should take away from this is that a force has a <b>positive</b>
torque when it tends to rotate an object in a <b>counter-clockwise</b>
sense.</p>

<p>Similarly, a force has a negative torque when it tends to rotate an
object in a clockwise sense.</p>

<p>What does the phrase 'tends to rotate' mean that was used in the
last two sentences?  It means that when a torque is applied to an
object at rest, the object will start rotating.  What will happen if
the object is already rotating?  Suppose an object is rotating
<b>counter-clockwise</b> at some instant when a negative torque is
applied.  The negative torque will tend to make the object rotate
clockwise.  This means that the effect of the torque in this case will
be to slow down the rotation, eventually cause it to stop, and then
start the object rotating clockwise.  What this means in technical
terms is that <b>torque is related to angular acceleration</b>, in the
same sense as force is related to acceleration.  The details will be
dealt with elsewhere.</p>

<p>The simulation lets you observe all this.  Continue to run the
simulation and observe what happens when the torque becomes negative.
At this point the rotation is still counter-clockwise, but the rate of
rotation is starting to slow down (negative angular acceleration)
until it finally stops and the object starts rotating clockwise.
Eventually the torque will turn positive again and the clockwise
rotation will start slowing down, etc.  STEP through the motion to be
able to observe things more slowly.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the torque depends on where the force is acting.
In our simulation, the torque is changing in magnitude, as well as in
sign.  The torque is zero when the point at which the force is acting
is directly below or above the CM, always assuming the force is
pointing straight down.
