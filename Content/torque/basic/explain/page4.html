<div class="title">Torque and Rotation</div>

<p>If you did not yet observe the motion when the force is acting at
the CM, please do so now.</p>

<p>PLAY the simulation while the constant force is acting at the CM
and the initial velocity is in some direction that is not parallel to
the force.  The resulting motion is projectile motion: parabolic
motion of the CM without wobble around the CM.</p>

<p>Drag the force vector so that it acts on the object at a point
to the left or right of the CM and PLAY the simulation again.  
</p>

<p>You still get the same parabolic motion of the CM, but this time
there is a wobble around the CM.  The rotational motion around the CM
depends on <b>where</b> the force is acting on the object.  Is the
rotation clockwise or counter-clockwise when the force vector acts to
the left or to the right of the CM?  <b>Try to observe!</b>
