<p><b>Question</b>. If one or several forces are acting on an object,
how will the object move?
</p>

<p>The simulation above lets you explore this question.  Buttons
<b>A</b> and <b>B</B> let you apply forces to the object.  Select one
of these buttons, click at the point in the object where you want a
force to act, and then draw the force vector by dragging the mouse
with the mouse button depressed.  If you select the other button, you
can apply a second force to the object.</p>

<p>The point denoted CM is the center of mass of the object.  You
can choose the initial velocity of the CM.  To do so, select button
<b>v</b>, click anywhere on the object, and then draw the velocity
vector by dragging the mouse with the mouse button depressed.</p>

<p>To erase a force or velocity vector, select the eraser and then
click on the vector.

<p>Click on the PLAY button and observe the motion.</p>

<p>The simulation assumes that the point at which a force is acting on
the object is at the tail end of the force vector, that the force does
not change during the motion, and that it continues to act at the same
point of the object during the motion.</p>

<p>A STEP button is available to step through the motion in small
steps.  

<p>The path followed by the CM will be drawn.
