<div class="title">Torque and Rotation</div>

<p>To make it easier to observe the rotational motion, let's pretend
we are in the reference frame in which the CM of the object is at rest
(CM frame).  The CM frame is a frame that is moving along with the CM.
Relative to this frame, the CM is stationary.
</p>

<p>The simulation is now set to let you view the object's motion in
the CM frame of reference.  PLAY it and observe just the rotational
part of the motion.  The velocity of the object relative to the LAB
frame will be indicated by the red arrow.
</p>

<p>Is the rotation clockwise or counter-clockwise when the force
vector acts to the left or to the right of the CM?</p>
