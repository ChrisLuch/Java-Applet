<div class="title">Torque About an Axis</div>

<p>Make a single force act on the object and then click the PLAY
button.  Barring exceptional circumstances, the object will rotate.
One says that the force creates a <i>torque</i> and that it is this
torque that makes the object rotate.  Sometimes a <b>non-zero</b>
force will create a <b>zero</b> torque.  Then the object will not
rotate.  Try to find an arrangement like this.
</p>

<p>The torque (about an axis) is a scalar that has a sign and a
magnitude.  It is important to understand what determines these two
attributes of a torque.</p>

<p><b>Sign of torque</b>. Let a single force be acting on the object.
Arrange things so that the torque is positive and observe the sense of
rotation.  Then arrange things so that the torque is negative and
observe the sense of rotation.
</p>

<p>If a torque makes an object rotate counter-clockwise, one defines
the torque to be <b>positive</b>.  The torque is <b>negative</b> if it
makes the object rotate clockwise.
