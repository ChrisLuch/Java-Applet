<div class="title">Torque About an Axis</div>

<p>Although the torque due to a force depends on
</p>

<ol>

<li>the magnitude of the force</li>

<li>the direction of the force</li>

<li>the reference point</li>

<li>the point at which the force is acting,</li>

</ol>

<p>it does not depend on items 2 to 4 <b>independently</b>, but
depends on them only <b>through</b> the <i>lever arm</i>.  If you
select SHOW LEVER ARM, the lever arm for the given configuration will
be shown in green.
</p>

<p>If the letter <i>l</i> denotes the lever arm, <i>F</i> the
magnitude of the force, and <font face="symbol">t</font> (read: "tau")
the torque, then
</p>

<p class="equation"><font face="symbol">t</font> = (sign) <i>Fl</i> .
</p>

<p>In this equation it is assumed that the force vector lies in the
plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, as in our simulation.
Otherwise, we would have to consider the component of the force in
this plane.  A force component parallel to the rotation axis would not
contribute to the torque about this axis.</p>

<p>Observe how the lever arm changes when you change one of the items
2 to 4.  However, if several of these are varied such that the lever
arm and the sign do <b>not</b> change, the torque does <b>not</b>
change.
</p>

<p>For more information on the lever arm, go to Torque/Lever
Arm/Explain It.  Also see the Get Information item.
