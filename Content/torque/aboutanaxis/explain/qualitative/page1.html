<div class="title">Torque About an Axis</div>

<p><b>Preparation</b>: Torque/Basic Facts/Explain It.
</p>

<p>The quantity that makes an object rotate about an axis is called
the <i>torque about that axis</i>.

When an object rotates about an
axis of fixed direction (the axis itself does not need to be fixed),
then it is sufficient to work with the scalar component of the torque
in the direction of this axis, also called the <i>torque about this
axis</i>.</p>


<p>For a general rotation in three dimensions that is not about an
axis whose direction is fixed, the explanation of the motion requires
torques that are vectors.  When an object rotates about an axis of
fixed direction (the axis itself does not need to be fixed), then it
is sufficient to work with the scalar component of the torque in the
direction of this axis, also called the <i>torque about this
axis</i>.</p>

<p>Being the scalar component of a vector, the torque about an axis
can take on both positive and negative values.</p>

<p>In this section, we will consider only rotations about an axis
fixed in direction so that only the torque about this axis is needed,
and not the torque vector.  We will follow common practice in such
cases, which is to refer to 'the torque about the axis' simply as the
<i>torque</i>, for brevity.
</p>

We will examine

<p>

<ul>

<li>the sign of the 'torque'</li>

<li>the physical significance of the 'torque'</li>

<li>the situations in which only a single scalar component of the
vector torque is needed.</li>

</ul>
