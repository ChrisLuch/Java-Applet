<div class="title">Torque About an Axis</div>

<p><b>What is unrealistic about the present simulation?</b>
</p>

<p>The purpose of the present simulation is to illustrate the
definition of torque about an axis, to give an indication of when the
torque is large or small, and to show when it is positive or negative.
This is done by <b>pretending</b> the axis about which the torque is
taken is fixed.  The corresponding rotation is shown with an angular
speed that is larger if the net torque is larger and with a sense
corresponding to the sign of the torque.
</p>

<p>The simulated motion is unrealistic in several respects:
</p>

<ul>

<li>It is a rotation about a fixed axis through O even though in
reality there may be no fixed axis through O and the motion of the
object may be quite different.</li>

<li>It has constant angular speed and therefore zero angular
acceleration, while in reality a non-zero net torque produces
<b>non</b>-zero angular acceleration.</li>

<li>It stops as soon as the object has rotated to the point where the
net torque is zero.  In reality, the motion would overshoot this point
and then oscillate around it, assuming that the forces don't change
and that they continue to act at the same points in the body.</li>

</ul>
