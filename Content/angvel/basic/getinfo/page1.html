   <p><b>Angular velocity as a scalar quantity</b>.  The following
   diagram illustrates the definition of the (scalar) angular velocity
   of a moving object.

	<p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

	<p>A car is moving in a straight line along a road.  The center of
	the car marks the car's position.  From a fixed point O a dashed
	line has been drawn to the car.  The car's position can be defined
	by the length <i>r</i> of this line and the angle <font
	face="symbol">q</font> between this line and a horizontal reference
	direction pointing to the right.  The pair of coordinates
	(<i>r</i>,<font face="symbol">q</font>) is called the car's
	<i>polar coordinates</i>.

	<p>The time-rate-of-change of <font face="symbol">q</font> is
	called the car's <i>angular velocity</i>.  For a review of the
	concept of "time-rate-of-change" go either to the link under
	Related Items or to Term'logy & Not'n/Time-rate-of-ch'ge.

	<p>The time-rate-of-change of <font face="symbol">q</font> is
	denoted <i>d</i><font face="symbol">q</font> / <i>dt</i>.  It is
	customary to denote this quantity by the symbol <font
	face="symbol">w</font> (Greek letter: read "omega").  Thus, the
	angular velocity is

	<p align="center"><font face="symbol">w</font> = <i>d</i><font
   face="symbol">q</font> / <i>dt</i> .</p>

   <p>It is customary in dealing with angular velocity to measure
   angles in radians.  The corresponding SI-unit of the angular
   velocity is rad/s.  For a review of the radian measure of an angle,
   go either to the link "Angle" under Related Items or to
   Kinematics/Angle/Get Information.

	<p><u>Comment 1</u>. The angular velocity is positive when the angle <font
   face="symbol">q</font> is increasing, i.e., when the dashed line
   from the reference point O to the moving object is rotating in the
   positive (counter-clockwise) sense.  It is negative if the dashed
   line is rotating in the negative sense.

	<p><u>Comment 2</u>. The value of <font face="symbol">w</font>
	depends on the location of the reference point O.  The farther the
	point O is away from the path of the object, the smaller is <font
	face="symbol">w</font>.  This is different from the velocity.
	Velocity is equal to the time-rate-of-change of the position
	vector, but changes in the position vector do not depend on the
	origin from which the position vector is taken.
