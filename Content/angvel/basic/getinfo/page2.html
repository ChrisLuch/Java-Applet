   <div class="title">Angular Velocity</div>

   <p><b>Angular speed and speed</b>.  The <i>angular speed</i> of an
   object is the magnitude of the object's angular velocity.  It too
   is denoted by <font face="symbol">w</font>.  It can be related to
   the object's speed as follows.  Let's look at the case of circular
   motion first.

   <p>Angular velocity can be defined not only for straight-line
   motion, as in Figure 1 on Page 1, but for arbitrary curvilinear
   motion.  In fact, the most frequent application of the concept of
   angular velocity is in circular motion.

   <p>The following Figure 2 illustrates the quantities involved in
   the definitions of the angular speed <font face="symbol">w</font>
   and the speed <i>v</i> of a particle moving in a circle.

   <p align="center"><img src="AngSpeedCircle.gif"></p>

   <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

	<p>The particle itself is not shown in Figure 2, but the instants
	of time are indicated when the particle is at different points on
	the circle: time <i>t</i> = 0, time <i>t</i>, and time <i>t</i> +
	<i>dt</i>.  In the time interval from <i>t</i> = 0 to <i>t</i>, the
	particle travels a distance <i>s</i> and its angular coordinate
	increases from <font face="symbol">q</font> = 0 to <font
	face="symbol">q</font>.  During the subsequent very small time
	interval <i>dt</i>, the particle travels an additional distance
	<i>ds</i> and changes its angle by <i>d</i><font
	face="symbol">q</font>.

	<p>From the definition of the radian measure of angles (go
	either to "Angle" under Related Items or to
	Kinematics/Angle/Get Informtion), it follows that

	<p align="center"><i>s</i> = <i>r</i> <font face="symbol">q</font>
	<img src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (1)</p>

	and

	<p align="center"><i>ds</i> = <i>r</i> <i>d</i><font face="symbol">q</font>
   <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (2)</p>

	<p>Dividing both sides of Equation (2) by the time <i>dt</i>
	elapsed while the particle is moving through the angle
	<i>d</i><font face="symbol">q</font> and moving the distance
	<i>ds</i> gives

   <p align="center"><i>ds</i> / <i>dt</i> = <i>r</i> <i>d</i><font
   face="symbol">q</font> / <i>dt</i> <img src="small.gif" height="1"
   width="40"> (3)</p>
	
	which with the symbols for speed and angular speed is

   <p align="center"><i>v</i> = <i>r</i> <font face="symbol">w</font>
   .  <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (4)</p>

	<p><u>Comment 1</u>. Mathematically, in order to get Equation (4),
	one must take the limits of the ratios in Equation (3), such that
	both the numerators and denominators go to zero.  In standard
	calculus notation, these limits are denoted <i>ds</i> / <i>dt</i>
	and <i>d</i><font face="symbol">q</font> / <i>dt</i>.  In our
	derivation, we have let this notation do double duty and denote
	both ratios of very small quantities and the limits of these
	ratios.

	<p><u>Comment 2</u>.  Compare Equations (1) and (4).  Both of them
	relate angular quantities to quantities measured along the
	circumference of the circle.  In both cases the angular quantity,
	angle or angular speed, is multiplied by the radius <i>r</i> to
	give the quantity along the circumference, distance or speed,
	respectively.

	<p>Equations (1) and (4) are used frequently.  You need to remember
	the factor of <i>r</i>.  It is easy to know, on dimensional
	grounds, that this factor must be on the side of the angular
	quantities.

	<p><b>Question</b>.  Suppose a paricle is moving along some
	arbitrary trajectory, as in Figure 3 below.  How are the particle's
	speed and angular speed related then?

	<p align="center"><img src="AngSpeedArbitrary.gif"></p>

	<p align="center"><b>Figure 3</b></p>

	<p>Again, the diagram in Figure 3 does not show the particle, but
	indicates the locations of the particle on the trajectory at times
	<i>t</i> and <i>t</i> + <i>dt</i>.  The particle is moving from
	right to left, generally speaking.

	<p>Angle <font face="symbol">a</font> is the angle between the
	particle's position and velocity vectors at time <i>t</i>.  (The
	position vector goes from point O to the particle, the velocity
	vector points along the trajectory.)

	<p>The small arc of length <i>b</i> which can be treated like a
	straight line in the limit of vanishing <i>d</i><font
	face="symbol">q</font> is related to <font face="symbol">q</font>
	and <i>ds</i> by

	<p align="center"><i>b</i> = <i>r</i> <i>d</i><font
   face="symbol">q</font> = <i>ds</i> <i>sin</i> <font
   face="symbol">a</font> . <img src="small.gif" height="1"
   width="50"> (5)

	<p>Dividing both sides of the last equality by <i>dt</i> gives

   <p align="center"><i>r</i> <font
   face="symbol">w</font> = <i>v</i> <i>sin</i> <font
   face="symbol">a</font> . <img src="small.gif" height="1"
   width="50"> (6)	

	<p>For <font face="symbol">a</font> = 90<sup>o</sup>, this equation
	reduces to Equation (4).

	<p>One can use Equation (6) to measure the speed of the car shown
   in Figure 1 on Page 1 as follows.  One could aim a telescope from
   point O to the car, measure the distance <i>r</i> from the telescope
   to the car, the angle <font face="symbol">a</font> between the line
   of sight and the road, and the angular speed <font
   face="symbol">w</font> of the telescope as it is keeping the car in
   view.  Given these three values, the car's speed <i>v</i> can be
   calculated using Equation (6).
