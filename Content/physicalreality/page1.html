  <div class="title">Physical Reality</div>

  <p>The physicist and natural philosopher Henry Margenau described
  physical reality by means of diagrams like the one below.</p>

  <p>The <i>P-plane</i> on the right represents the phenomena and our
  perceptions of them.  E.g., we see the sky blue at times and the sun
  red, and we see the sun moving through the sky in the course of a
  day.  These are perceptions from the P-plane.  "P" stands for
  "perceptions" or "phenomena".

  <p>Physicists make abstract models in order to organize and predict
  the happenings on the P-plane.  These models form the
  <i>C-field</i>.  The models employ constructs or concepts.
  Therefore the name "C-field".  The constructs are connected among
  each other to form a network.  The layperson too works with a
  C-field to order his or her experiences of physical nature, but this
  C-field is different from the one that has been developed by
  physicists. This is one main reason why physics is difficult, but
  exciting to learn.  (Another difficulty is the mathematical nature
  of the C-field of physicists.)  It is never easy to change one's
  pattern of thinking, but it is exciting to experience new ways of
  looking at things.

  <p>Having to change one's pattern of thinking applies to beginning
  students of physics and experienced physicists alike.  The reason is
  that physics is constantly changing, sometimes rather abruptly.  The
  models created by physicists to understand nature do not last
  forever, but evolve or sometimes are replaced entirely.  This is in
  order to accommodate new experimental discoveries or to achieve a
  simplification in one's understanding.

  <p>Thus, the models of physics have a limited life.  They are also
  limited in their range of applicability.  These limitations make
  room for the creative process.  The creative process in physics is
  guided by similar considerations as the creative process in art:
  beauty, simplicity, structure, to name only a few.

  <p>Some of the constructs in the C-field are connected to elements
  of the P-plane. This map of the C-field onto the P-plane allows us
  to "explain" the observations in the P-plane in terms of the C-plane
  model.  It is via the C-field that two observations in different
  parts of the P-plane can be linked: each observation is linked to
  constructs in the C-field and these are linked within the C-field to
  each other.  For example, the blue color of the sky can be linked to
  wireless radio reception.  These two phenomena seem unrelated on the
  P-plane.  However, they are related through Maxwell's theory of
  electromagnetism (plus other theoretical developments): blue light
  is an electromagnetic wave, and so are radio waves.  Only the wave
  lengths are different.

  <p>Notice that the C-field contains deeper lying constructs
  not directly connected to the P-plane.  They don't have a direct
  intuitive interpretation, but are essential elements of the model,
  i.e., theory. 

  <p>Physics constructs tend to be expressed mathematically.  Already
  Galileo, about 400 years ago, said that mathematics is the language
  of physics.  The mathematical approach has been extremely succesful
  in modeling the natural world, surprisingly so, and has made it
  possible to make very accurate quantitative predictions. E.g., we
  can predict to a minute that there will be an eclipse of the sun
  hundreds of years from now.

  <p>Even introductory physics courses require a certain amount of
  mathematics, and being comfortable with this mathematics will
  certainly make learning the physics easier.  MAP reviews and
  provides exercises on some of this mathematics in the section titled
  "Mathematics".
