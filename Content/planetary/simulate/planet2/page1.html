  <div class="title">Planetary Motion</div>

  <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the motion of a planet around the
  sun (or another fixed star), or the motion of a moon or satellite
  around a planet.</p>  

  <p>For detailed information on how to use the applet, go to Applet
  Help on the applet's Help menu and look at Help and ShowMe.  A
  Lesson accompanying the applet is available there as well.
  </p>

  <p>The applet is available in two versions: "Planet Motion 1" and
  "Planet Motion 2".  The applet on Page 2, "Planet Motion 2", allows
  you to vary the shape of the planet's orbit by varying the energy
  and angular momentum of the planet-sun system.  In "Planet Motion
  1", you can vary the shape of the orbit by varying the eccentricity
  and semi-major axis of the orbit.  "Planet Motion 1" is found at
  Energy/Energy Conservation/Simulate It/Planet Motion/Planet Motion 2.</p>

  <p>
    When the eccentricity and semi-major axis of a planet's orbit are
    set, the values of the energy and angular momentum are uniquely
    determined, and vice versa.  In either applet, if the values for
    one pair of values are set by the user, the values for the other
    pair are calculated and displayed in that applet's data box.
