  <div class="title">The MAP System</div>

  <p>The title of this page is ambiguous.  It can be interpreted in
  two ways that will now be described.</p>

  <ol>

  <li>MAP (Modular Approach to Physics) is the name of a computer
  tutorial system in physics.  The system uses a content management
  system called CANU (Content Arranging and Navigating Utility).  CANU
  has two main functions: (a) to allow an instructor to arrange
  content in tree-like fashion and (b) to allow a learner to navigate
  through this content.  At the moment you are using the CANU
  Navigator.  The CANU Navigator starts running when you click the
  Start button on the MAP front page.  The CANU Arranger is available
  only to instructors.<br>

  <br>CANU delivers content in packages called "courses".  When
  starting the CANU Navigator you are asked to select one of these
  courses from the Content menu.  One of them has the name "MAP".  It
  has the same name as that of the entire tutorial system because it
  is part of that system.  MAP introduces the basic concepts
  physicists use to describe and understand nature.  There may also be
  a course arranged by your instructor.  It may use some material from
  the course MAP and some new material added by your instructor.</li>

  <br>

  <li>The content of MAP is arranged according to a system.  (Here
  and in the remainder, "MAP" refers to the course MAP, not to the
  entire tutorial system.)<br>

  <br>One learns by doing.  MAP presents its content in the form of
  learner activities.  When navigating down a branch of MAP, you will
  always end up at a set of buttons similar to that illustrated
  below.<br> 

  <br>All buttons in the set carry labels describing activities. The
  set of activities represented here is a typical sample. The nature
  of these activities is described below.  Each kind of activity lets
  you approach the subject in a different way.<br>

  <p align="center"><img src="MAPactivities.jpg"></p>

  The rectangular buttons when pressed will open up a content item.
  The oval buttons are branch points.  When pressed, they will lead to
  one or more content items or further branch points.  For example,
  Test Yourself would be a branch point leading to a set of
  questions.<br>

  <br><ul>

  <li><u>Get A Glimpse</u>. Introductory material that tries to draw
  your attention to an important aspect of the concept to be studied,
  without being technical.  The presentation might involve a video or
  flash animation, or a picture with some text.</li>

  <br>

  <li><u>Explain It</u>.  Lesson-like material that explains the
  concept in an interactive manner, often with the aid of one or more
  interactive applets.  The accompanying text may have an audio
  track.</li>

  <br>

  <li><u>Simulate It</u>. Simulation(s) used in the Explain-It items.
  Here, the simulations are not embedded in a lesson, but are made
  available directly . This allows quick access to the simulations for
  in-class use as 'dynamic overheads' by the instructor and for
  experimentation by the learner.  The simulations under Simulate It
  usually have a larger screen format than when used in the Explain-It
  context.<br>

  <br>Detailed explanations of the features of a simulation (applet)
   are available under Help on the applet's menu bar (top left corner
   of the applet window).  Go to Applet Help on the Help menu and look
   at both the Help and ShowMe files where available.<br>

  <br>Some simulations have suggested Activities to be carried out with
  the simulations.  These would be available from the Related Items
  panel in the lower left-hand corner of the CANU Navigator window.</li>

  <br>

  <li><u>Test Yourself</u>.  Collection of questions, e.g., in
  multiple-choice, numerical answer, or fill-in-the-blank format.
  These questions are based on the material dealt with in the other
  items related to the given concept.<br>

  <br>The questions will usually require not mere repetition, but an
  application of the concept to a somewhat different situation.
  Therefore they may at times give the appearance of presenting new
  material.  Beginning learners should not get discouraged if they
  find quite a few of the questions challenging.  Full solutions are
  always provided and can be used to learn the material.  Eventually,
  and when preparing for exams, learners should be able to answer the
  questions correctly and be prepared to handle similar ones on their
  own.</li>

  <br>

  <li><u>Get Information</u>.  Textbook-like material that summarizes
  the important points.  This material is not presented in interactive
  fashion.  Often, Get Information items are linked to other content
  items to provide quick access to relevant background information.
  Such links are provided in the Related Items panel in the lower
  left-hand corner of the CANU Navigator window.  To see an example,
  click on the item 'Physical Reality' under Related Items. The item
  will be presented in a second (pop-up) window.  When done with the
  item, close that window like any other browser window.</li>

  <br>

  <li><u>Other Kinds of Content Items</u>.  The kind of content items
  available will vary from concept to concept.  At times you will
  encounter fewer content items than those shown above or other ones,
  e.g., Go To Lab.</li>

  </ul>

  <br>For detailed information on how to use MAP, e.g., on how to
  search for topics, go to the User's Guide on the Content menu at
  the top left corner of the CANU Navigator window.<br>
