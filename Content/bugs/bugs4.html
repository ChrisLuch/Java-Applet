         New applet that lets you steer a changing velocity vector by
         controlling an acceleration vector in an acceleration dial.

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request --> 
		  
		  <p>This applet will be located at Acceleration/Basic
		  Facts/Simulate It/Accel. vs. Veloc.  Another instance of it,
		  somewhat reduced in size vertically, will be at
		  Acceleration/Basic Facts/Explain It, pages 5 to 7.

		  <p>The applet is very similar to the applet under Velocity
        that lets you control a car's motion by dragging a velocity
        vector in a velocity dial.  Here, the car is replaced by a
        velocity vector and the velocity dial by an acceleration dial.
        There is no analogue of the speedometer and compass on he
        right-hand side of the applet screen in Acceleration Space.

		  <p>The portions of the applet window are titled 'Velocity
		  Space' on the left and 'Acceleration Space' on the right.
		  Acceleration Space contains only an acceleration dial in the
		  middle of this space.  Velocity Space contains a very short
		  pair of axes at the center to mark the origin of velocity
		  space and a velocity vector whose tail end is attached to this
		  origin.  The tip of the vector can be dragged to any point in
		  Velocity Space, but not beyond.  The entire vector cannot be
		  dragged, i.e., its tail end remains attached to the fixed
		  origin at the center.

		  <p>As soon as one clicks in the acceleration dial, an
		  acceleration vector is drawn and the tip of the velocity
		  vector starts moving in a direction and at a rate as dictated
		  by the acceleration vector.  The motion is frozen when the tip
		  of the velocity vector reaches the boundary of Velocity Space
		  or when the mouse button is released.  At this point, the tip
		  of the velocity vector can be dragged to some other point, and
		  the motion can be resumed by clicking at some point in the
		  acceleration dial.

		  <p>If one clicks in the acceleration dial right in the center,
		  with a bit of an error margin, one sets the acceleration to
		  zero and one gets a constant velocity.  There should be a
		  display somewhere in Acceleration Space that the acceleration
		  is zero, or unequal to zero, whatever the case may be.

		  <p>There is a trace toggle button.  When that is selected, the
		  trace of the velocity vector's tip will be shown, as in
		  One-Ball the trace of the ball is shown. Clicking the button
		  again will hide the trace.

		  <p>There is a REPLAY button.  This becomes active only after
		  the velocity vector has been moved around.  When the button is
		  clicked, the initial velocity vector selected by the user
		  before clicking in the acceleration dial will be restored and
		  the initial acceleration vector will be attached with its tail
		  end to the tip of the velocity vector.  A forward STEP button
		  becomes active at this point as well.  This button lets you
		  step through the recorded motion of the velocity vector in
		  steps of reasonable and fixed size.  At every step, the
		  acceleration vector will be shown attached to the tip of the
		  velocity vector.  It will also be shown in its acceleration
		  dial.  The trace may be on or off during the stepping process.
		  After the first step, a back-step button will become active as
		  well that lets you step backward.  See the Work-Kinetic Energy
		  applet in this connection.

		  <p>There is a RESET button that resets everything to the default.

		  <p>There is a toggle button labeled 'Object'.  When this
		  button is selected, a disk is placed on the screen.  This disk
		  is in Position Space which one should imagine as being
		  superimposed on both Velocity Space and Acceleration Space.
		  Thus, the disk can move freely on top of both of these spaces.
		  It should have a transparent appearance if that is possible,
		  so that any vectors or boundary lines that it may happen to
		  cover will still be visible through the disk.  The disk can be
		  dragged by hand to any point in Velocity or Acceleration
		  Space.  When the acceleration has been set and the velocity
		  vector is responding, the disk moves accordingly representing
		  the corresponding position.  See the Work-Kinetic Energy
		  applet in this connection.  When the acceleration is zero, the
		  disk will be the only thing moving on the screen.  When the
		  disk crashes into a boundary, the motion is frozen.  It will
		  resume when the disk is either dragged away from the boundary
		  or the velocity vector is reset to point to the inside of the
		  boundary.

		  <p>The disk's motion will continue when the 'Object' button is
		  unselected.  Selecting it again will show where the disk is at
		  that moment.  Since one has taken the mouse off the
		  acceleration dial to select this button, one will have to
		  restart the motion by clicking in this dial.

		  <p>When one is in REPLAY mode and the object is selected, the
		  acceleration vector will be shown attached to the object.  It
		  is also shown attached to the velocity vector in this mode.
		  The attached acceleration vector will make it clear that the
		  acceleration vector never points to the outside of the
		  object's path.

		  RFE/BUG 2001.07.25.001

        </font> <!-- brief description -->
        <p>
		  There are two items to be done in the Energy Race, one alteration and one bug fix.
        </p>

        <!-- the url that this rfe or bug relates to (might be multiple urls here)-->

		  url: <a href="energy/energy_cons/simulate/race/">Energy/Energy Conservation/Simulate It/Energy Race</a>

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->
        <p>
		  BUG: In its default setting, the applet displays the message
		  "Turn Friction Off" on both buttons underneath the two
		  inclines.  Since the friction is already set to zero, the
		  buttons should display the message "Turn Friction On".  After
		  one has toggled the buttons, the buttons perform correctly.

		  <p>ALTERATION: During the race, the colored blocks are
		  randomly transformed from blue to red and pink.  Change this
		  so that, for each of the two systems, only the blocks on the
		  left are transformed into red TK blocks (starting with the
		  block in the top left corner, going down the first column,
		  then continuing at the top of the second column, etc.), and
		  only the blocks on the right are transformed into pink RK
		  blocks (starting with the block in the bottom right corner,
		  going up the last column, continuing at the bottom of the
		  second last column, etc.)  The blue blocks in the middle are
		  gradually being transformed.  This way, it is easier to see
		  what is going on and the colors in the system correspond to
		  the three colors underneath the system box.

        <p>
		   This is an applet that takes up the full content screen
		   width, but less than the full content screen height, to leave
		   some room for text underneath the applet.  The applet will go
		   on pages 2 and 4 of the content item above, with the text on
		   those pages underneath the applet.  Pages 1, 3, and 5 will
		   have only text in the content area.

		  <p>
		    The applet area is divided by a vertical line into two
		  areas: the area on the left is titled "Position Space" and the
		  area on the right "Velocity Space".  Position space could be
		  somewhat wider than velocity space.

		 <p>
		   The controls include a button that toggles between the
		 picture of a race car and a flat disk (orange?).  The car is
		 the default on p.2.  It is placed in the center of position
		 space and can be dragged to a new location.

		 <p>
		   Velocity space contains a circle (velocity dial) in its lower
		   half and a speedometer (needle moving across a horizontal
		   scale) and direction indicator (compass dial with unit vector
		   rotatable around fixed point at center).  The default setting
		   has the velocity vector equal to zero.

		 <p>
		   The object in position space and the velocity vector in the
		   velocity dial in velocity space are both draggable.  When the
		   object is being dragged, this is just to set the position of
		   the object.  There will be no effect on the velocity vector
		   in the dial.

		 <p>
		   When one clicks anywhere in the velocity dial, the system
		   draws a velocity vector from the center of the dial to this
		   point and the object moves with this velocity.  If one
		   releases the mouse button, the motion is frozen.  Clicking
		   again somewhere else in the velocity dial, will resume the
		   motion with the new velocity.  Not releasing the mouse button
		   and dragging the velocity vector with the mouse will
		   continually update the object's velocity and move the object
		   accordingly.  The speedometer and compass always correspond
		   to what is shown in the velocity dial.  If the object is a
		   car, the car's image always points in the direction of the
		   car's velocity.  If the object hits the boundary of position
		   space, the motion is frozen and will resume only if the
		   velocity is changed to a value that moves the car to the
		   inside of position space.  Alternately, one could drag the
		   object and then get the motion going again by clicking in the
		   velocity dial.  While one is dragging the object, the velocity
		   vector in the dial responds accordingly.

		 <p>
		   There is a trace button that allows the object's trace to be
		   displayed.  There is a REPLAY button and a STEP button that
		   work together as follows.  After having moved the object,
		   either by dragging the object itself or by dragging the
		   velocity vector, one can click REPLAY which, in the first
		   place, will restore the object to its initial position.  If
		   one then clicks STEP repeatedly, the object will retrace its
		   path in steps and the corresponding velocity vector in the
		   dial will be shown at each step.  IN ADDITION, the velocity
		   vector will be superimposed on the object at each step.
		   Already upon clicking REPLAY, the initial velocity vector
		   that started the motion will be superimposed on the object.
		   The programming done in the Energy/Work-Kinetic/Explain
		   applet may be useful here.  The step size should be
		   reasonably large (and fixed), and the program will have to
		   store position readings at much shorter time intervals in
		   order to be able to calculate good instantaneous velocities
		   to display at each step.  The trace could be on or off during
		   this stepping process.  If it is on, it should be apparent
		   that the instantaneous velocity vectors are tangential to the
		   trace.  One should be able to step forward and backward along
		   the object's path, as in the Wk-Kin applet.  When one has
		   taken at least one step, in the REPLAY mode, a back-step
		   button will become active to allow stepping back.

		 <p>
		   There should be a RESET button that restores the applet to
		   its default setting.

        BUG 2001.07.18.001<br>

        </font> <!-- brief description -->

        <p>
		   (a) There are two columns of text in the applet window.  The
		   right column must be shifted left somewhat so that the 'm/s'
		   unit of the last average velocity item comes into view.
			<p>
			(b) When one clicks in the applet window, the ball is
			positioned at that spot.  The clock does not start running
			until one moves the ball.  Change this so that the clock
			starts running as soon as one clicks in the window, even if
			the ball does not get dragged.
        </p>

		  <p>
		  Adjustment (b) is needed so that one can simulate the
		  situation in which an object has zero velocity for a while,
		  then non-zero velocity, then again zero velocity.  With this
		  one can show that the average velocity is not equal to the
		  mean of the initial and final velocity.
