        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->

		  <p>RFE: It is often of interest to start both balls at exactly the
		  same position, in order to compare differences in their
		  subsequent orbits, e.g., when one ball has air resistance and
		  the other one does not, or when the two balls start with
		  different velocities.  It is tedious to manipulate one ball
		  into exactly the same position as the other.  So it would be
		  good to be able to accomplish this upon clicking a button.  Or
		  maybe instead of a button one could double-click on the
		  ball. Maybe double-clicking is preferable because it would
		  save a button.  Also one could make both balls
		  double-clickable.  Whichever ball is double-clicked gets moved
		  on top of the other one.  Right now, it is always ball 1 that
		  is on top, even if ball 2 has been moved last.  It is sometimes
		  desirable to have a choice in which ball is the one that is
		  movable (and whose velocity vector can be dragged) when they
		  are superimposed.

		  Double Clicking on the background will swap ball1 behind ball two. Double click again and it will sap back in front.

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->

        <p>The Acceleration/Basic Facts/Explain It session has eight
         pages.  I will describe what needs to be done on each page.

		  <ul>

		  <li>Page 1.  There will only be the existing text.</li>

		  <li>Page 2.  On the left-hand side place the applet from
		  Torque/About An Axis/Apply It/Physical Pendulum.  Set the
		  radius of the bob to 0.4 m and the length of the pendulum to 5
		  m.  Select button 2 so that the velocity and acceleration
		  vectors are displayed.  Make all other buttons inactive,
		  including the START/PAUSE button.  The pendulum should be
		  swinging as soon as the applet has loaded.  It should be
		  swinging between -120 deg and 120 deg.  Text is on the
		  right-hand side.</li>

		  <li>Page 3.  Place the 4-motions applet from
		  Interactions/Basic Facts/Get A Glimpse on the left and text on
		  the right, as has already been arranged.  There are a couple
		  of problems with the 4-motions applet.  (a) When one selects
		  choice (d), the response page has a 1-page pagebrowser at the
		  bottom.  Get rid of this.  (b) Some of the applet is chopped
		  off at the bottom because space is taken up for both the page
		  navigator and the choice button navigator.  Is there anything
		  one can do about this?  I could live with the way things are
		  at present, although not ideal.</li>

		  <li>Page 4.  There will be only text on this page.  No changes
		  required.</li>

		  <li>Pages 5-7.  Divide the content area into an upper and a
		  lower portion, about 2/3 for the upper and 1/3 for the lower
		  portion.  The new applet in which a velocity vector will be
		  steered by means of an acceleration vector (Acceleration/Basic
		  Facts/Simulate It/Accel. Vs. Veloc.) will be in the upper
		  portion and the existing text in the lower portion. The full
		  applet will be available on all three pages.</li>

		  <li>Page 8.  Existing text only.</li>

		  </ul>

		  A number of alterations of the existing displacement applet
		  are requested.  These were worked out together with Gary Raab.
		  I think they will significantly improve the applet.
        </p>

		  <p>The average velocity applet will have corresponding
		  alterations.  See under Velocity below.

		  <ol>

		  <li>Add another button to the applet.  The button is titled
		  'Initial Position'.  Until this button is clicked and
		  depressed, one can do nothing with the applet.  When it is
		  depressed, one can click anywhere on the screen to place the
		  ball at that point.  One can then drag the ball elsewhere as
		  long as the mouse button stays depressed.  As soon as the
		  mouse button is released, the ball's position is set and the
		  Initial-Position button is raised.  The button could be
		  clicked again and the ball's initial position could then be
		  set somewhere else.  When the button is clicked and one clicks
		  on the ball itself while it is still at the origin, the ball's
		  position does not get changed, unless one drags the ball.</li>

		  <p>

		  <li>After clicking the Initial-Position button, if one drags
		  the ball with the shift key depressed, the ball moves along a
		  horizontal, vertical or 45<sup>0</sup> direction, whichever is
		  closest to the direction in which one is dragging.</li>

		  <p>

		  <li>Add a button labeled 'Position Vectors'.  When clicked,
		  this button will draw position vectors to the initial and
		  final ball positions.  These vectors will be labeled
		  <b>r</b><sub>i</sub> and <b>r</b><sub>f</sub>, respectively.
		  The <b>r</b> will have an arrow above it.</li>

		  <p>

		  <li>Add a 'grid' toggle button that will extend the x,y axes
		  to a grid, to make it easier to set the position of the ball
		  to a grid point.</li>

		  <p>

		  <li>To make it easier to set the ball to a grid point, replace
		  the ball by a 'hollow' one (transparent may be a better word)
		  with a pair of horizontal and vertical diameters inside the
		  ball to define the center point of the ball, which then can be
		  aimed towards a grid point.</li>

		  <p>

		  <li>Enhance the tip of the green displacement arrow so that
		  one can see clearly in which direction the arrow is
		  pointing.</li>

		  <p>

		  <li>Change the display of the numerical values as follows.  In
		  the top left corner, create a column headed 'distance
		  traveled' and in the top right corner a column titled
		  'displacement'.  To the left of the title 'distance traveled'
		  draw a small red square color-coded with the red curve traced
		  out by the ball.  To the left of the title 'displacement' draw
		  a small green square color-coded with the green displacement
		  vector.

		  <p>The only entry under 'distance traveled' is 's =
		  ... m'. This is currently the last entry on the right.</p>

		  <p>The only entry under 'displacement' is <b>d</b> =
		  (<i>d</i>,<font face="symbol">q</font>) = (... m,
		  ... deg). The <b>d</b> should have an arrow above it, as
		  should all boldface symbols listed in the following
		  paragraph.</p>

		  <p>Add a toggle button titled 'More Data'.  When that button
		  is depressed, the following additional entries are placed in
		  the displacement column on the right underneath the one entry
		  described in the preceding paragraph:</p>

		  <p><b>r</b><sub>i</sub> = (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>i</sub> = (...,...) m

		  <br><spacer type="horizontal" size="13">= (<i>r</i>,<font
		  face="symbol">q</font>)<sub>i</sub> = (... m, ... deg)

        <p><b>r</b><sub>f</sub> = (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>f</sub> = (...,...) m

        <br><spacer type="horizontal" size="13">= (<i>r</i>,<font
        face="symbol">q</font>)<sub>f</sub> = (... m, ... deg)

		  <p><b>d</b> = <font face="symbol">D</font><b>r</b> = (<font
		  face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i>,<font
		  face="symbol">D</font><i>y</i>) = (..., ...) m

		  <br><spacer type="horizontal" size="50">= (<i>d</i>,<font
        face="symbol">q</font>) = (... m, ... deg)</li>

         In two questions of the listed item, the Submit and Give Up

          Replace Edmonton library animation with our own in Potential

        <p>
          On p.4 - 12 of Energy/Potential Energy/Explain It/Uniform
          Force the applet requires the Edmonton library, while the
          similar applets on earlier pages don't require this
          library. I think the only thing the Edmonton library is used
          for is the animation.  It is our applet.  It would be good
          if we could replace the animation with our own routine,
          unless a lot of work is required.  Use the same routine as
          in Acceleration/Due to Gravity/Simulate It/One Ball.  We are
          dealing with projectile motion in the present applet, as we
          are in One Ball.  (The energy bar needs to be animated too,
          of course.)

		  <p>
			When block 2 is resting on the platform (either after
			lowering block 2 or raising the platform), the vectors F and
			T1 in the fbd for block 1 should be absent (because there
			will be no force needed to hold block 1 at rest and because
			the string will be slack), and the tension T2 in the fbd for
			block 2 should be replaced by an upward normal force vector
			labeled 'N' and equal in magnitude to W2.  The normal force
			vector should be in blue (0,0,255).  Just use the color
			constant for normal force.  There should be a comment on the
			screen saying "String is slack".  This comment will be in the
			same place where the other comments are placed, e.g., "Blocks
			held at rest".</p>

		   <p>However, as soon as block 1 is being moved left, the
			applet should behave as at present, except that the tensions
			should be shown stippled (like F) rather than greyed out.
			The symbols F and T1 and T2 should have question marks behind
			them as at present, but not be greyed out (to make them
			easier to see).  The color of the force vector F should be
			red (constant color for friction), and so should be the label
			'F'.  The tip of F vector should be the same as the tips of
			the other vectors.</p>

		 <p>
		   There should be a black dot at the center of each fbd, to
		   symbolize the object the forces are acting on.

	    <p>Raise fbd 1 slightly so that the F vector when extended is
	    above the value for KE1.  When the mass of block 1 increases,
	    the label T1 of the tension jumps from below the vector to
	    above the vector.  Keep it below the vector at all times.</p>

		 <p>Write all variables in italics, including <i>KE</i> and
		 <i>h</i>.</p>
	
       <p>
		   The motion is still a bit jerky, particularly evident in the
		   speedometer.  Is there anything one can do to make it
		   smoother?  Low priority for this request and can be ignored.

		  <ol>

		  <li>When the applet first comes on (default state), both
		  inclines are frictionless.  However, the friction buttons both
		  read "Turn Friction Off".  They should read "Turn Friction
		  On".  The buttons do function properly, i.e., when clicked
		  they turn the friction on and then read "Turn Friction Off".</li>

		  <li>When an object is selected, the button for that object
		  should indicate that the object is on the incline.  At
		  present, when one object is selected, the button does acquire
		  a green rectangular frame.  However, when the second object is
		  selected, the first button becomes unselected.  Both buttons
		  should stay selected.</li>

		  <li>At present, one has to click the START button twice to get
		  the motion going.  The motion should start on the first
		  click.</li>

		  <li>Replace the RESET icon by the REPLAY icon, because this is
		  the functionality of the button.  We don't need a RESET button
		  here.</li>

		  <li>Add the logo bar and remove the question mark button.
		  Space for the bar can come out of the white space at the
		  bottom of the area showing the colored blocks and out of the
		  grey divider between the top and bottom halves of the applet
		  window.</li>

        RFE/BUG 2001.09.12.001 <br>

        </font> <!-- brief description --> <p>There are several
        changes and enhancements required as detailed below.  In
        addition, Gary wants a version with only a single particle (no
        2 or 12 particle options).  Let's call this 'Particle in
        Electric Field (Reduced)'.  Otherwise, this applet is like the others.

        </p>

        <!-- the url that this rfe or bug relates to (might be multiple urls here)-->

        url: <a
href="force/elcrmagn/simulate/electric">Force/Electromagnetic/Simulate/Electric</a> <br>

        </p>

		  <p>Details:<br>

		  <ul>

		  <li>The data table at top right should have the colon
          immediately after the variable symbol, not just before the
          value.  At present, there are two colons in the line for the
          time t.  Delete the second one.  Add a space before m/s^2
          after the acceleration value.</li>

			 <p>

			 <li>Change the color of the velocity vector from green to
			 magenta.  Change the color of the velocity components from
			 black to the new official color.</li>

			 <p>

			 <li>For Gary's one-particle applet, provide separate sliders
			 for q and m, not a single q/m slider.  The q-slider should
			 let you set values of the charge in integer steps from -5 C
			 to 5 C.  The m-slider should let you enter mass values in
			 integer steps from 1 to 5 kg.  The value of q/m should be
			 printed out in C/kg in the control box area, somewhere near
			 the two sliders in a logical place.</li>

			 <p>

			 <li>The charge sign toggle button should be deleted, because
			 we can set the sign now with the q-slider.</li>


			 <p>

			 <li>Try to re-arrange the various items on the control panel
			 in a more logical and pleasing manner.  E.g., the two
			 buttons controlling the velocity and its components should
			 be added to the collection of the other buttons on the
			 left.</li>

			 <p>

			 <li>Delete the question-mark Help button, and add a MAP logo
			 bar with drop-down menu and Info file.</li>


			 <p>The following changes affect only the 2-particle and
			 12-particle modes and can be implemented later.  Maybe it
			 would be easiest to make a totally separate 1-particle
			 applet for Gary, starting with a copy of the existing applet
			 and stripping everything that is not needed.</p>

			 <li>In the 2-particle mode, there should be two velocity
			 vectors visible initially.  Currently there is only one
			 vector visible and adjustable.  When one runs the simulation
			 and clicks REPLAY, a second mustard vector becomes visible.
			 It should be visible and adjustable right from the
			 start.

			 <p>In this mode, de-activate the velocity-components button,
			 and let the display-velocity button act on both velocity
			 vectors, so that either both of them are displayed or
			 hidden.  (At present, the button does not do anything in
			 this mode.)  If both are displayed, keep them displayed
			 during the motion.  (At present, only the velocity vector of
			 particle 1 moves along with the particle.)</li>

			 <p>

			 <li>In the 12-particle mode, de-activate both the
			 display-velocity and velocity-components buttons.</li>

			 <p>

			 <li>In the 12-particle mode, REPLAY does not work properly.
			 It does not move the particle back to the origin and, if one
			 changes the field direction, the new motion is not oriented
			 relative to the new direction.</li>

         When the <E>-vector is set to a vector that is rotated
         counter-clockwise a bit and the velocity vector is changed to
         be perpendicular to the new <E>, and the charge is negative,
         the trajectory is not a parabola with the field direction at
         its axis.  It crosses over the field direction.  Perhaps the
         value of <E> is not properly implemented in the animation.

         In the B-applet, it can happen that clicking on the slider
         when q = 3 will produce a change in r-value, both the printed
         r-value and the simulated r-value.

        <p>
		   When m=2, v=3, q=3, B=2, an r-value of 9 is displayed, which
		   is correct.  If one now clicks on the q slider, the slider
		   tab, the r-value changes to 4.5 while the q value remains at
		   9.  If one now changes the q-value to 1, the r-value
		   increases by a factor of 3 to 13.5.  Thus, things are
		   consistent from this point on, if one takes 4.5 as correct.
		   The system behaves as if the scale factor of 9 in front of
		   the formula m*v/(q*B) has become reset.

			This effect does not occur for other settings of m, v, q, B.

		    This is a copy of an email message dated 01-05-25 requesting
		    a number of changes to the ExB applet.  I am reproducing the
		    email message below.
        </p>

        url: <a
href="force/elcrmagn/simulate/exb">Force/Electromagnetic/Simulate/ExB Drift</a> <br>

        <p>
		  Here are my thoughts on the ExB applet.  I am assuming that
things are programmed via a Galilean transformation to the drift
frame.  The steps should be as follows.

<p>I will use the &#60...&#62 notation to denote a vector, e.g.,
&#60v&#62 to denote a velocity and v the magnitude of the velocity.

<p>I will use vp to denote the numerical value of the variable v expressed in
pixels and vu to denote the numerical value of v expressed in some given
unit of v.  ('u' stands for unit.)  Similarly, Ep and Eu for the numerical
values of E in pixels and in E-units, etc.

<p>

<ol>

<li>One gets &#60vin&#62 in pixels from the green arrow.  This yields vinp and
the angle of &#60vin#62.</li>

<p>

<li>One calculates the drift velocity &#60u&#62 = &#60E&#62X&#60B&#62
in whatever units E and B may be given.  First, one obtains Ep from
the red arrow and then transforms Ep by means of a scale factor to a
new Eu.  Let the maximum value of this new Eu be 0.001, say.  (I think
the program has 0.5 at present.)  And let the minimum value of Bu be
1.  Then this would give a maximum value of uu = 0.001.  (The reason I
am choosing these funny values is that u must be much less than the
speed of light for the equations to be physically accurate, and I am
taking the speed of light equal to 1, in u-units.  It would not matter
if in the simulation we chose uu to be much bigger than 0.001, but it
helps me in visualising things if I use uumax = 0.001.)</li>

<p> 

<li>Before going to the next step one must now invent a scale factor
that translates the pixel units of &#60vin&#62 to u-units.  Suppose we
want uumax = 0.001 to be represented by 50 pixels.  Then vu = 1
corresponds to 50,000 vp and 1 vp corresponds to 2x10^-5 vu.  Thus, if
&#60vin&#62 is 100 pixels long, then vinp = 100 and vinu = 0.002.</li>

<p>

<li>In the following, let us work with a velocity scale factor such that a
numerical value of vp = 1 corresponds to vu = 0.00002 and with an E-field
scale factor such that an Ep = 120 (or some value like this) corresponds
to Eu = 0.001.</li>

<p>

<li>Now calculate &#60v'in&#62 = &#60v&#62 - &#60u&#62, where
&#60v'in&#62 is the initial velocity in the drift frame.  Here v and u
must be in the same units, either pixel units or u-units.  v'in will
then be in these units as well.</li>

<p>

<li>Now calculate the orbit in the drift frame.  This is done by
calculating &#60v'(t)&#62 rotating the vector by 90 deg, and multiplying it by
a suitable scale factor C to get a display that fits on the screen.  The
resulting vector is denoted <r'(t)>.  It is the position vector in the
drift frame.  The scale factor C used here is unrelated to the other scale
factors and is quite arbitrary because it simply determines the scale of
the representation in position space.  One cannot make a 'mistake' by
choosing C incorrectly, other than that the circle in which the particle
moves might be too large or too small for inspection.</li>

<p>To calculate &#60v'(t)&#62, one can use closed expressions of the
form v'x = v'in*cos w*t and v'y = v'in*sin w*t, where v'in = const
(calculated in Step 3) and w = (q/m)*B. w too needs to have a scale
factor D which will determine the speed of the animation, i.e., the
rate at which the particle is performing one revolution.

<p>Did Jonathan use closed expressions like these or did he use a
numerical integration?  If one does a numerical integration, one must
use for the acceleration <a> the vector product (q/m)
&#60v&#62X&#60B&#62, i.e., ax = (q/m)*B*v*y and ay = -(q/m)*B*v*x.
Again, there needs to be a scale factor introduced into these
equations that will determine the speed of the animation.  (Varying
the scale factor is equivalent to varying the size of the integration
time step dt because the expressions for ax and ay are multiplied by
dt.)

<p>Step 4 yields &#60r'(t)&#62, the position vector of the particle in
the drift frame, e.g.,

<p>x'(t) = C*v'in*sin D*w*t.  

<p>It is assumed here that w is calculated in u-units for q/m and B and v'in
is calculated in u-units as well.  C is chosen so that x' and y' are in
pixel units.</li>

<p>

<li>Now calculate &#60r(t)&#62 = &#60r'(t)&#62 + &#60u&#62*t, the
position vector in the lab frame.  We want &#60r(t)&#62 in pixel units
and must make sure that the two terms &#60r'(t)&#62 and &#60u&#62*t are
both in pixel units.  We already have &#60r'(t)&#62 in pixel units.

<p>The speed of a point on the &#60r'&#62-circle in pixels per time unit is
C*v'inu*D*wu.  We must introduce a scale factor F that translates uu to up
= F*uu such that

<p>C*v'inu*D*wu/up = v'inu/uu.

<p>Thus, 

<p>C*v'inu*D*wu/(F*uu) = (v'inu/uu) * (C*D*wu/F) = v'inu/uu

<p>whence

<p>C*D*wu/F = 1 or F = C*D*wu.

<p>Thus, we get &#60r(t)&#62p = &#60r'(t)&#62p + F*&#60u&#62u*t.</li>

        <p>Details:<br> In the default setting, the table top is just
        below the 19.60 N text for the weight.  When the acceleration
        is then made unequal to zero, the springs get compressed or
        expanded around their mid level.  Thus, upon contraction of
        the springs, the top of the springs and the block come down
        and the bottom of the springs and the table come up an equal
        amount.

On p.8 and 9, when one clicks RESET after pausing the pendulum, the
pendulum is not restored to its default position, but stays where it
is.  Only when one clicks on the pendulum, after clicking RESET, is
the pendulum restored to its default position.  However, even clicking
will not return the pendulum's default settings.  E.g., the pendulum's
size will not be restored to the default value.  Also, the buttons
will not become deselected.

There should also be a RESTART button that is distinguished from the
RESET button in the usual way.

On p.8 and 9, PLAY acts like a RESTART button after RESET.  RESET does
not restore the applet, but PLAY following RESET causes the applet to
restart the motion from the previous starting point.  This should not
be so.  PLAY should start the motion at the point at which the
pendulum is at rest.

          On p.8 and 9, when button 1 is selected, only the
          gravitational force is shown before the start of the motion.
          When the motion is started, also the constraint force is
          shown.  The constraint force should be shown whenever the
          gravitational force is shown.  Basically, the display should
          correspond to reality in a state of frozen animation.  At
          the instant of frozen animation when the pendulum is at
          rest, the constraint force is not zero.  It may be quite
          small for certain pendulum settings.  Set the radius of the
          disk to 4 m, and the constraint force will be significant,
          even when the velocity of the CM is momentarily zero.

          when the net torque is printed out as zero.  There should be
          a small, but finite-sized 'bin' of settings at which the net
          torque is printed out as zero.  In all of these settings,
          there should be no motion upon PLAY.

         Go to p.3, say, and point the mouse over the RESET button.
         The tooltip displayed is RESET DEMONSTRATION.  It remains
         visible way too long after moving the mouse pointer off the
         button.

			This may or may not be related: When one returns to the
			Presenter after typing this bug report in Secure Shell, it
			takes the Presenter forever to regenerate the various applets
			on p.3 with buttons and pagebrowser buttons.

 BUG 2001.05.31.008 <br>

        <p>
          Very slow restoration of applet after using another
          application, e.g., Secure Shell to edit text.
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose you are on p.4 of this item and then use Secure
          Shell to edit some of the text and then return to page 4, it
          takes a very long time for page 4 to get restored: the
          pagebrowser is missing at first, and so are the buttons
          under the applet.  These items get restored one by one very
          slowly and may never get completely restored.  It seems to
          help to move the mouse pointer over the places where the
          buttons are supposed.  Some buttons come on when one is
          doing this.

		      Applet that allows adding an unspecified number of vectors and that
adds vectors automatically on screen after vector coordinates (either
polar or cartesian) have been entered

		  <p>
		   This applet could use the same
			functionality as the Specifications Applet as far as vector specification
			is concerned.  Before a vector is added, the student selects one of the 4
			modes for specifying the vector, then adds the vector.  The resultant
			vector too can be displayed in any of the four modes.<br>

			Start the applet with a small cross in the middle of the screen to mark
			the point at which the tail end of the first vector will be placed.  This
			cross can be dragged at any time, to allow better placement in case the
			sum of the vectors should extend beyond the edges of the window.<br>

			Then, when the first vector has been specified, the system will display it
			when an ADD button is clicked.  Then when the next vector is specified,
			the system will join it tip-to-tail to the first vector when and ADD
			button is clicked.<br>

			There is a RESULTANT button that will display the resultant on the screen
			when clicked and will display its coordinates, in any of the four forms
			chosen.<br>

			The vectors don't need to be labeled.<br>

			One can add as many vectors as one likes, but the magnitudes of the
			vectors that one can add are restricted so that the sum of three vectors
			can always be made to fit on the screen.  Say, let the magnitude of a
			vector be restricted to 100 pixels.  The system could display magnitudes
			directly in pixels (or perhaps pixels/10 and show one decimal point).

        <p>On p.2, a student can arrange the magnitude and direction
        of the vector.  On p. 3 this vector is maintained and a second
        vector equal to the first one is added.  This is as it should
        be and should not be changed.</p>  

		  <p>On p.4, the vectors a and b are shown with different
        magnitudes than the default value on p.2.  The vectors on p. 4
        should be as follows: for <a> it should be the vector chosen
        by the student on p. 2, and for _b_ it should be the negative
        of this vector.  Also, the minus sign in front of _b_ should
        be more visible.</p>

		  <p>On p.5, there should be <a> with the direction and
		  magnitude chosen on p.2 and the corresponding b = - a.</p>

		  <p>If students randomly jump around between pages 2 and 5,
		  after having chosen a vector on p.2 initially, the system
		  should always use as the default the vector chosen by the
		  student on p.2.  Only on p.2 can the direction of this vector
		  be changed by the student.</p>

		  <p>If students directly jump to one of the pages 3-5
		  initially, from p.1, without ever going to p.2, the default
		  vector should be the vector presently used by the system.</p>

		    The present applet has three buttons.  The new applet will
		    five buttons.  I am describing the five buttons one by one
		    in the order from left to right.  The present DELETE button
		    will exist no longer and will be replaced by a RESET button
		    that deletes everything and resets the applet to the initial
		    state.
		 <ul>
		    <li>Button 1 (old): Draw-Vector button that lets you draw a
		    vector after the button has been clicked.  At the beginning,
		    this is the only button that is active.  The button must be
		    clicked again before the second vector can be drawn.  After
		    the second vector has been drawn, the button becomes
		    inactive.  Both vectors can be changed and moved around
		    freely.  The two vectors are labeled 'a' and 'b'.</li>

			 <li>Button 2 (new): Draw-Resultant button.  When clicked,
			 the system will draw the correct resultant if more than one
			 vector is on the screen.  The resultant will be drawn in
			 green off to one side as on p.4 of the existing applet and
			 labeled 'a + b'.  If there is only one vector on the
			 screen, the Resultant button is inactive.  The icon for the
			 Resultant button is a double vector slanted like the single
			 vector on button 1.</li>

			 <li>Button 3 (old): Dotted-Line button that works as at
			 present and lets you draw a dotted line at any time.</li>

			 <li>Button 4 (new): Reset.  Restores applet to its initial
			 state with an empty window and only button 1 active.</li>

			 <li>Button 5 (new): My-Answer button.  When this button is
			 pressed, the student can draw his sum of the two vectors on
			 the screen.  The vector will be labeled 'my sum' as at
			 present.  After the vector has been drawn it can be modified
			 an moved around, so there is no need for an Eraser button.
			 It would be nice to have an icon for this button, but maybe
			 'My Answer' as a label is clearest.</li>

		   In the Vector Addition/Explain It/Tip-To-Tail applet, there
		   is a rapid flicker on p.1 and subsequent pages when one moves
		   the mouse pointer over the Next Page arrow without clicking
		   on the arrrow.  The flicker does not stop right away when one
		   moves the mouse pointer off the arrow.  The tooltip never
		   appears.</p>

		 <p>I would suggest to remove the tool tip for the forward and
		 back arrows and for the page number buttons.  I think this is
		 what is causing the trouble, and the function of these items is
		 obvious anyway.</p>

		 <p>DO THIS EVERYWHERE, NOT ONLY IN THIS ONE ITEM.  THE TOOLTIPS

		  If one enters a negative angle, the angle is displayed
		  correctly as a negative angle.  This should not be allowed.
		  At present, if one enters something like a80, the computer
		  pings and does not respond otherwise.  The same should happen
		  if one enters -80.

        <p>
		  This is not really a bug, but an alteration.  It concerns the
		  list of 8 navigation possibilities in the Vector Specification
		  and Multiple-Vector Addition applets.  It was requested by
		  Gary R. and is quite reasonable and systematic.

		  At present the list starts with WofN and then goes on to EofN,
		  relating angles to north.  We would like to bump the first
		  item, WofN, to the end of the list and keep the sequence of
		  the other items unchanged.  Thus, the new list will be, in
		  sequence, EofN, NofE, SofE, EofS, WofS, SofW, NoW, WofN.  This
		  way the first two pairs will give vectors in the first
		  quadrant if the angle is less than 90 degrees, which is what
		  students will want to do most, and each subsequent pair
		  involves the same pair of geographic directions, i.e., E/N,
		  S/E, W/S, N/W.

		  This applet needs several enhancements that are parallel to

        <p>
		  Items 1 - 6 from the Displacement applet should be implemented
		  here as well.  

		  <p>Add a new item 1a:

		  <p>1a. After the ball has been set (or the ball may still be
        sitting at the origin without anything having been done to
        it), it should be possible to drag the ball to another
        location, as at present.  In order to do so, one must click on
        the ball and drag it.  Clicking outside the ball should not
        produce a movement.  When clicking on the ball one should be
        able to click anywhere inside the ball without affecting the
        starting position.  The entire ball should be the handle by
        which one can drag the ball.  This is implemented already, I
        believe.</p>

        <p>The clock should start running the instant one clicks on
        the ball.  This is NOT implemented at present.  At present,
        the clock starts running when one is actually moving the ball.
        As implemented at present, the clock should stop running when
        one releases the mouse button, not when one stops dragging the
        ball.</p>

        <p>One should be able to click on the ball again and drag it
        to another place, to be able to carry out a number of
        displacements in succession with the clock being paused in
        between.  The displacement vector will be the overall
        displacement vector.  These things are already implemented.</p>

		  <p>Item 7, the data display, needs to be modified
		  as follows.</p>

		  <p>The headings in the top left and right corners should be
		  changed to 'average speed' and 'average velocity',
		  respectively, color-coded as the corresponding items in the
		  Displacement applet.  Under 'average speed' there are three
		  entries, in the following order:</p>

		  <i>s</i>:<spacer type="horizontal" size="30"> ... m
		  <br>

		  <i>t</i>:<spacer type="horizontal" size="32"> ... s
		  <br>

		  <i>v<sub>av</sub></i>:<spacer type="horizontal" size="15"> ... m/s</p>

		  <p>Under 'average velocity' there are three entries, in the following order:</p>

		  <b>d</b> = (<i>d</i>,<font face="symbol">q</font>):<spacer
        type="horizontal" size="40"> (... m, ... deg)
        <br>

        t:<spacer type="horizontal" size="95"> ... s
        <br>

        <b>v</b><sub>av</sub> = (<i>d</i>/<i>t</i>,<font
        face="symbol">q</font>):<spacer type="horizontal" size="27">
        (... m/s, ,,, deg)</p>

		  <P>The toggle button 'More Data' adds to the three items under
		  'average velocity' the same set of extra items as in the
		  Displacement applet, plus the following additional one at the
		  end of that list:</p>

		  <b>v</b><sub>av</sub> = <font
        face="symbol">D</font><b>r</b>/<i>t</i> = (<font
        face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i>/<i>t</i>,<font
        face="symbol">D</font><i>y</i>/<i>t</i>):<spacer type="horizontal" size="13"> (..., ...) m/s

		  <br><b>v</b><sub>av</sub> = (<i>d</i>/<i>t</i>,<font
        face="symbol">q</font>):<spacer type="horizontal" size="78">
        (... m/s, ... deg)</p>
