<p><b>Preparation</b>:  Displacement/Displ't vs Dist'ce/Explain It.

<p>The simulation is on Page 2.  Instructions on how to use the applet
and a lesson on displacement are available under Applet Help from the
applet's Help menu.  A set of suggested activities to be performed
with the applet are available under Related Items.


   <p>The simulation allows you to place a ball anywhere in the applet
 window and then drag it to another position.  The displacement and
 the path traveled are displayed.  Initial and final position vectors
 can be displayed as well.

 <p>Related numerical values can be displayed.
