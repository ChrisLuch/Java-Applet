<p>Yes, some vector quantities (including displacement) are associated
with motion, but not all quantities associated with motion are vector
quantities.</p>

<p>For example, the speed of a particle is a quantity that is
associated with the motion of the particle, but it is scalar, not a
vector quantity.  Another scalar quantity associated with motion is
kinetic energy.  Thus, if a quantity is associated with motion, it
does not automatically make this quantity a vector quantity.</p>
