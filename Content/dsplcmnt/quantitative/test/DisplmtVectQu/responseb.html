<p>Yes, a displacement in three dimensions is specified by three
numbers, e.g., its magnitude and its direction (in three dimensions a
direction is specified by two angles), but this alone does not make it
a vector quantity.</p>

<p>For example, the state of a gas can be specified by its mass, its
pressure, and its temperature. Although these are three numbers, the
state of a gas is not a vector quantity.</p>
