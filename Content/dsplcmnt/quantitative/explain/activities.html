  <div class="title">Activities on Displacement and Distance
  Traveled</div>

  <p>Perform the following experiments and related calculations. Check
  your results against those displayed by the applet.</p>

  <p>

  <ol>

  <li>Set the ball to some initial position and then drag it to a
  final position.  Use the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of the
  ball's initial and final positions to calculate the <i>x</i> and
  <i>y</i> components of the ball's displacement vector <img
  src="dtransp.gif" align="bottom">.</li>

  <p>

  <li>Using the data from the first exercise, calculate the magnitude
  <i>d</i> of the ball's displacement and the angle <font
  face="symbol">q</font> between the displacement vector and the
  positive x-direction, taken in the positive sense (counter-clockwise
  starting from the <i>x</i>-axis).</li>

  <p>

  <li>Compare the green displacement vector to the blue path along
  which the ball has traveled.  Which has the greater length?  Compare
  the magnitude <i>d</i> of the displacement calculated in the
  previous exercise to the distance <i>s</i> traveled displayed by the
  applet.</li>

  <p>

  <li>Set the ball's initial position to (10,-10) m.  It will make it
  easier if you display the grid when you do this.  Then make the ball
  undergo a displacement equal to 30 m in magnitude and in a direction
  that forms an angle of 150<sup>0</sup> with the positive
  <i>x</i>-axis, measured in the positive sense from the
  <i>x</i>-axis.  It may be difficult to produce these values exactly.
  It will be good enough if you get close.  From these data calculate
  the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of the ball's final
  position.</li>

  <p>

  <li>Set the ball's initial position to (20,-10) m.  Then drag the
  ball in a straight line to (20,-20) m, again in a straight line to
  (-15,-20) m, and again in a straight line to (-15,15) m.  It does
  not matter if you cannot achieve these exact values.  To ensure that
  the ball moves along a straight line, hold down the Shift key while
  you are dragging the ball.

  <p>Calculate the total displacement vector, both in Cartesian and in
  polar coordinates (magnitude and direction).

  <p>Also calculate the distance <i>s</i> traveled and compare it to the
  magnitude <i>d</i> of the displacement.</li>

  </ol>
