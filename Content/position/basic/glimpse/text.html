<p>Physicists tends to simplify things, sometimes to the point of
caricature.  In so doing, they are creating models of nature that are
easier to deal with than the full reality.

<p>For example, a bee like the one in the picture on the left gets
treated like a <i>mass point</i> of zero extent, and one then talks
about the <i>position</i> of the bee.

<p>Sometimes one has to do better than that and treat the bee as an
<i>extended object</i>, whose parts have their own positions.  In such
a case, it is useful to consider the center of mass of the bee, which
again is a single point with a single position, and to use this as the
"position of the bee".
