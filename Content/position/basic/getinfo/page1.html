  <div class="title">Position and Position Vector</div>

  <p>The diagram below illustrates all basic aspects related to position and
  the position vector.

  <p align="center"><img src="PositionInfo.gif"></p>

  <p>In the diagram we have an extended object, a ball.  What would
  one mean by the <i>position</i> of the ball?

  <p>To define a single position as the position of the ball, one
  idealizes the ball to a mass point and takes the position of this
  mass point to be that of the ball. One can take the mass point to be
  located anywhere in the ball, e.g., at the ball's center as in the
  diagram.

  <p>The position of the ball can be characterized by a displacement
  vector from a fixed point O to the ball.  This vector is called the
  ball's <i>position vector</i>.  It is denoted <img src="r.gif"
  align="bottom">.  

  <p>Suppose a pair of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes are drawn with point
  O as their origin.  The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of the
  ball's position relative to these axes are also the <i>x</i> and
  <i>y</i> components of the ball's position vector.  This can be
  expressed symbolically, using parentheses to indicate the
  components, as

  <p align="center"><img src="r.gif" align="bottom"> = (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) .</p>

  <p>For an example illustrating this notation see the diagram above.
  The components <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> of the position vector are
  indicated graphically by pale blue lines.

  <p>The ball's position vector depends on where point O, the
  <i>reference point</i>, is chosen.
