  <p>The applet lets you control the motion of a car by controlling
  the car's acceleration by means of an acceleration dial.  For
  detailed information on how to use the applet, please go to Applet
  Help on the applet's Help menu.

 <p>Currently the Velocity Space check box is checked.  This means the
 applet will show the motion in <i>velocity space</i>, which is the
 space of velocity vectors.  The dotted background suggests
 <i>position space</i>.  When you start the motion, the car will stay
 at a fixed position at the origin of velocity space, but you will see
 the position space background moving relative to the car.

 <p><b>Set</b> the car's initial velocity by clicking at the car's
 center and dragging the tip of the magenta velocity vector.</p>

 <p>The orange dot at the tip of the velocity vector represents the
 car's acceleration vector, which is zero initially.  As soon as you
 click somewhere in the Acceleration Dial, this vector will become
 non-zero and the motion will start.  It will continue as long as you
 keep the mouse button depressed.  

 <p><b>Vary</b> the acceleration by dragging the acceleration vector in the
 acceleration dial, and <b>observe</b> how the car's velocity changes.

 <p>To see the relationship between the orange acceleration vector and
 the magenta velocity vector more clearly, uncheck the Car checkbox.

  <p>Can you observe that the relationship between the acceleration
  and velocity vectors is exactly like that between velocity and
  position vectors?  

  <p>For a review of the latter, go to Velocity/Basic Facts/Simulate
  It.  Imagine that the labels 'Velocity Space' and 'Acceleration
  Dial' are changed to 'Position Space' and 'Velocity Dial',
  respectively, and that the velocity vector is labeled position
  vector and the acceleration vector is labeled velocity vector. With
  these name changes, the present simulation performs exactly like the
  simulation in Velocity/Basic Facts/Simulate It.</p>

  <p><b>Lesson To Be Learned</b></p>

  <blockquote>As the time-rate-of-change of the position vector is equal to the
  velocity vector, so the time-rate-of-change of the velocity vector
  is equal to the acceleration vector.</blockquote>
