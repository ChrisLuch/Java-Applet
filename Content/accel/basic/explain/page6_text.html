  <div class="title">Acceleration</div>

  <p>Let us now observe the relationship between acceleration and
  velocity in more detail.</p>

  <p>Reset the applet, and move the tip of the velocity vector along
some path, by controlling the acceleration in the Acceleration
Dial. 

<p>Check the Vel Path checkbox to exhibit the trace of the tip of the
velocity vector. Click REPLAY to restore the velocity vector to its
initial setting.  Make sure the Accel #2 checkbox is checked so that
the acceleration vector is shown attached to the tip of the velocity
vector. Uncheck the Car checkbox if you don't want to be distracted by
the car's image.

<p>Step through the motion in steps of equal time duration by clicking
the STEP button repeatedly. At each step, observe the direction of the
acceleration vector in relation to the path of the tip of the velocity
vector.  You can also watch the motion continuously by clicking Play.

<p><b>Question</b>: Is the acceleration vector at a given instant
tangential to the path of the tip of the velocity vector? </p>

<p><b>Question</b>: Is the magnitude of the displacement of the tip
of the velocity vector in one step proportional to the magnitude of
the acceleration at this time?</p>

<p>The answers to these questions should be YES.</p>
