  <p><b>Definition</b></p>

  <blockquote>Acceleration is the <b>time-rate-of-change of
  velocity</b>.</blockquote>

  <p><b>What does this mean?</b></p>

  <p>In general, the acceleration vector points in a different
  direction than the velocity vector, because the <b>change</b> of the
  velocity vector is in general not in the same direction as the
  velocity vector itself.  See the simulations on Pages 2 and 5.</p>

  <p>Acceleration is a vector quantity because velocity is a vector,
  and therefore a <b>change</b> in velocity divided by a scalar (the
  time elapsed) a vector also.  The acceleration vector points in the
  direction in which the velocity vector is changing.  This is the
  direction in which the tip of the velocity vector is moving if the
  tail end is fixed.</p>

  <p>The relationship between acceleration and velocity is exactly
  like that between velocity and position.  Remember that velocity is
  the time-rate-of-change of the position vector.  The simulations on
  Pages 5 to 7 will be based on this analogy.</p>

  <p>An object's acceleration is non-zero whenever the object's
  <b>velocity</b> is changing.  Note that acceleration is <b>not</b>
  defined as the time-rate-of-change of <b>speed</b>, which would make
  it a scalar quantity.  What difference does that make?</p>

  <p>With acceleration defined as the time-rate-of-change of
  <b>velocity</b>, the acceleration of a particle is non-zero whenever
  the particle is moving on a curved trajectory even though the
  particle's speed may be constant.  The vector nature of acceleration
  is crucial in many contexts, e.g., when trying to explain the motion
  of a planet in terms of Newton's laws.</p>
