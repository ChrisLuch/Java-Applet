<div class="title">(d) Constant Velocity Motion</div>

<p>Yes, motion (d) is the only motion in which the object has zero
acceleration.

<p align="left">To start the motion, click anywhere in the simulation
window.  To reset, click a second time.

<p>The object is moving in a straight line with constant speed.  One
also says that it is moving with constant velocity.

<p>For the acceleration to be non-zero, the <b>velocity</b> must be
<b>changing</b>, either its magnitude or its direction.  Here neither
the magnitude nor the direction of the velocity are changing.  Thus
the acceleration is zero.
