<div class="title">Four Motions</div>

<p align="left">
Click Play <img src="../start.gif" align="top"> in any of the four
quadrants on the left, and observe the motion of the object.  You can
run several motions at once, by clicking Play in several quadrants.

<p>The Reset button <img src="../reset.gif" align="top"> in a quadrant
allows you to reset the motion in that quadrant and play it again.

<p>In some of the motions the acceleration is non-zero and in one or
more of them it is zero at all times.</p>


<p><b>Question</b>. In which of the four motions is the object's
acceleration equal to <b>zero</b>?

<p>Select (a), (b), (c), or (d) below, and then click SUBMIT to find
out if the acceleration is zero or not for that motion.
