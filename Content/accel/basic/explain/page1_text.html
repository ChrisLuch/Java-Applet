  <p>In daily life, we say that a car is accelerating when its speed
  is increasing.  When a car maintains constant speed while going
  through a turn or when its speed is decreasing in braking,
  ordinarily we would not say that the car is accelerating.  However,
  the concept of acceleration as used in physics is defined so that
  the car has a non-zero acceleration in all of these cases.</p>

  <p>Acceleration is a central concept in mechanics because the
  central law of motion, Newton's second law, relates the acceleration
  of an object to the forces acting on the object.  For this law to be
  true, acceleration must be defined the way it now is in physics.
  You need to understand this definition in order to be able to
  understand and apply Newton's second law of motion.</p>

  <p>The concept of acceleration is derived from that of velocity, but
  it is <b>not</b> the <b>same</b> as velocity.  Both of them are
  vector quantities.  Can you think of a motion in which the
  acceleration vector is not in the same direction as the velocity
  vector at every instant? An example will be shown on Page 2.</p>
