    <p>The image shows the acceleration (orange arrow) of a planet
    revolving around the sun.  The acceleration points from the planet
    to the sun.

    <p>This suggests that the sun has something to do with the planet's
    motion.  Newton suggested that the sun is exerting a force on the
    planet called <i>gravitational force</i> and stated in his second law
    of motion that this force is proportional to the planet's acceleration.

    <p>For the acceleration to be pointing towards the sun and for
    Newton's second law to be true, the acceleration must be defined in
    a certain way.  Acceleration must be defined as a vector and cannot
    be defined as the time-rate-of-change of <b>speed</b>, a scalar.
    Instead, acceleration is defined as the time-rate-of-change of
    <b>velocity</b>, a vector.

    <p>Because of the essential role of acceleration in Newton's second
    law of motion, a clear understanding of the definition of
    acceleration and what the definition entails for acceleration is
    very important.  E.g., how can one understand that this definition
    implies that in the elliptical motion of a planet the acceleration
    always points to the sun?
