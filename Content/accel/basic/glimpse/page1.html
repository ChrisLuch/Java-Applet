    <p>As the dragster in the picture is leaving behind a cloud of smoke
    at the start line, it is "accelerating", in the everyday sense of
    the word, meaning its speed is increasing.</p>

    <p>In physics, words that have a certain meaning in everyday life
    often acquire a more specific and often somewhat different meaning.
    The word "acceleration" is one example.  In physics, an object has
    acceleration when its speed is increasing <b>or</b> when its speed
    is decreasing.  An object can even have acceleration when its speed
    stays the same!</p>

    <p>What then is acceleration in physics? - In physics, one says that
    an object is accelerating when it changes its state of motion, in
    other words, when it changes its <b>velocity</b>.  In physics,
    acceleration is defined as the time-rate-of-change of
    <b>velocity</b>.

    <p>Thus, an object is accelerating either when its speed is changing
    (increasing or decreasing - yes, even if the speed is decreasing
    does one say in physics that the object has acceleration!) or when
    its direction of motion is changing.  Remember that velocity is a
    vector quantitity.  Therefore we must consider changes in either
    its magnitude or direction.</p>

    <p>The dragster in the picture is accelerating because its speed is
    changing - the speed is increasing at this moment.  The direction of
    the dragster's velocity is not changing - hopefully for the driver.</p>

    <p>On Page 2, you can observe the acceleration of an object whose
    velocity is changing direction, namely, the acceleration of a
    planet.  You may want to go to the Link under Related Items and
    carry out the "Activity on Acceleration" with the applet.
    Instructions on how to use the applet are available under Applet
    Help on the applet's Help menu.  See the files called Help and ShowMe.
