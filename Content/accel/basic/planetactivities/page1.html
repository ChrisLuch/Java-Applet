  <div class="title">The Acceleration of a Planet</div>

  <p><ol>

  <li><b>Activitity 1</b>.  When the applet has loaded, check the
  Acceleration checkbox <img src="accelerationcheck.jpg"
  alt="Acceleration Checkbox" align="top"> to display the planet's
  acceleration vector in orange.  Play the motion without changing any
  of the other settings of the applet.  In particular, keep the
  setting of the Eccentricity slider at zero.

  <p>The planet should be moving in a circular orbit with constant
  speed.  Observe that the acceleration is <b>not</b> zero and that it
  points to the sun at all times.  The acceleration is not zero
  because the velocity of the planet is changing direction.</li>

  <p><li><b>Activity 2</b>.  Continuing from Activity 1, click Replay.
  Set the eccentricity to 0.400 and the semi-major axis to 1.3 AU.
  (1 AU = 1 astronomical unit; 1 AU is the average earth-sun
  distance.)

  <p>Play the motion.  The following image shows the planet and its
  acceleration at one instant during the planet's motion around the sun.

  <p>Observe that the acceleration is changing both magnitude and
  direction during the planet's revolution around the sun, but that it
  is always directed towards the sun.</li>
