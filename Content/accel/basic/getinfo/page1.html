  <div class="title">Acceleration</div>

  <p>The following definition of acceleration will be for a mass point.
  See Comment 3 at the end about what it means to talk about the
  "acceleration of an extended object".

  <p><b>Definition of acceleration in words</b>:

  <blockquote>Acceleration is the time-rate-of-change of velocity.</blockquote>

  <p><b>Definition of acceleration in symbols</b>:

  <p align="center">
    <img src="AccDefn.gif" alt="Definition of Acceleration">
  </p>

  <p>In this definition, <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a"
  align="bottom"> denotes the acceleration at time <i>t</i> and <img
  src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> the velocity vector of
  the mass point.  The symbol &Delta;<img
  src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> denotes the change in
  velocity between the instant at time <i>t</i> and a later instant at
  time <i>t</i> + &Delta;<i>t</i>,

  <p align="center">
    &Delta;<img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom"> = <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom">(<i>t</i> + &Delta;<i>t</i>) -
  <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">(<i>t</i>).
  </p>

  <p>The symbol <i>d</i><img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> is calculus notation for the more explicit
  notation with the limit symbol.  When the notation
  <i>d</i><img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> is
  used in physics, it is useful to think of <i>d</i><img src="v.gif"
  alt="vector v" align="bottom"> and <i>dt</i> as very small
  quantities and of the symbol <i>d</i><img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> as the ratio of these small quantities.

  <p>Acceleration is a vector quantity, arising from ratios that have
  a vector in the numerator and a scalar in the denominator.  The
  direction of the acceleration vector at a given instant is the
  direction in which the tip of the velocity vector is moving at that
  instant if the tail end of the velocity vector is being held fixed.
  (Otherwise, the motion of the tip of the velocity vector would not
  represent changes &Delta;<img src="v.gif"
  alt="vector v" align="bottom"> in the velocity vector, as are needed
  in the definition of acceleration.)  

  <p>With the tail end of the velocity vector held fixed, the tip of
  the vector describes a path.  Let's call it the <i>velocity
  path</i>.  At any given moment, the acceleration vector's direction
  is along the tangent to the velocity path at that instant.  See the
  following illustration which shows the velocity path of a mass point
  in magenta, three velocity vectors (in magenta) corresponding to
  three different instants of time, and the acceleration vectors (in
  orange) at these three instants.

  </p>

  <p>The magnitude of the acceleration is a scalar quantity denoted
  either by <i>a</i> or |<img src="a.gif" alt="vector a"
  align="bottom">|.  It has no special name.

  <p>The SI-unit of acceleration is m/s<sup>2</sup>.

  <p><u>Comment 1</u>.  The ratio &Delta;<img
  src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">/<font
  face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> behind the limit operation in the
  definition of acceleration is called <i>average acceleration</i>.
  With this concept, the definition of acceleration can be reworded as
  follows.

  <blockquote>The acceleration at time <i>t</i> is the limit of the
  average acceleration over a time interval extending from time <i>t</i>
  to time <i>t</i> + &Delta;<i>t</i> when <font
  face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> goes to zero.</blockquote>

  <p><u>Comment 2</u>. When a motion is along a straight line, say,
  the <i>x</i>-axis, most of the time one will be working with the
  <i>x</i>-component <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> of the acceleration instead of
  the vector <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom"> and will
  be referring to <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> as "acceleration" instead of
  "<i>x</i>-component of acceleration", for brevity's sake.  One may even
  drop the subscript <i>x</i> and write just <i>a</i> instead of
  <i>a<sub>x</sub></i>, again for brevity's sake.  However, one should
  explain that <i>a</i> denotes the (<i>x</i>-component of the)
  acceleration, not the magnitude of the acceleration, unless this is
  clear from the context.

  <p><u>Comment 3</u>.  When an extended object is moving, its parts
  may be moving with different accelerations, e.g., the object may be
  rotating or the object may be vibrating.  In such cases, one cannot
  just speak of "the acceleration of the object".

  <p>In many cases, however, it will be possible to assume the object
  to be rigid and non-rotating.  In such cases, all parts of the
  object have the same acceleration and it makes sense to speak of
  <b>the</b> acceleration of the object.  In other cases, e.g., when the
  object is rotating in addition to performing some motion as a whole,
  one will mean the acceleration of the center of mass of the object when
  speaking of the object's acceleration.  This should be made clear,
  however, unless it is clear from the context.

  <p><u>Comment 4</u>.  When a particle is moving in a circle of
  radius <i>r</i> with constant speed <i>v</i> (uniform circular
  motion), the direction of the acceleration is radial, from the
  particle towards the center of the particle's circular orbit, and
  the magnitude of the acceleration is equal to

  <p align="center">
   <i>a</i> = <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>r</i>.
  </p>

  <p>The acceleration vector, as always, is tangential to the velocity
  path, but it is radial to the position path in this case.
