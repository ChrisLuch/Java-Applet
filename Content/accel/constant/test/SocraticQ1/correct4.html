      <br>

      <div>A car (<font color="#3366FF">c</font>) with one headlight burned
      out is traveling at a constant speed of 18 m/s and passes a stopped
      police car (<font color="#FF0000">p</font>). The car is pursued
      immediately by the police cruiser, which has a constant acceleration
      of magnitude 2.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</div>

      <div>(a) How far does the police cruiser travel before catching the
      other car?</div>

      <div>(b) At what time will this occur? (Hint: Graphing may help to
      visualize this problem.)</div>

      <div><hr WIDTH="100%"></div>

      <p><font color="#FF0000">Correct!</font>

      <p>The condition for them being together is to have the same position,
      i.e.,

      <p><i>x</i><sub>p</sub> = <i>x</i><sub>c</sub>.
