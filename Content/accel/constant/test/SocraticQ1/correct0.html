      <div>A car (<font color="#3366FF">c</font>) with one headlight burned
      out is traveling at a constant speed of 18 m/s and passes a stopped
      police car (<font color="#FF0000">p</font>). The car is pursued
      immediately by the police cruiser, which has a constant acceleration
      of magnitude 2.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</div>

      <div>(a) How far does the police cruiser travel before catching the
      other car?</div>

      <div>(b) At what time will this occur? (Hint: Graphing
      may help to visualize this problem.)</div>

      <div><hr WIDTH="100%"></div>

      <div><font color="#FF0000">Correct!</font></div>

      <div><img src="CarChaseCorrect.gif"></div>

      <p>The acceleration of the police cruiser is constant in time, and
      that of the car is also constant but equal to zero.

      <p>Therefore the velocity of the cruiser increases linearly
      in time from zero, and that of the car remains constant.

      <p>The displacement of the car increases linearly in
      time and that of the cruiser increases with <i>t</i><sup>2</sup>.

      <p><b>Continue with Question "Car Chase (SQ)/Car Chase 1".  

      <p>To simplify navigation to "Car Chase 1" and subsequent questions in
      the Car Chase question sequence, the Tree Navigation mode is more
      convenient.  In this mode, the navigation panel on the left looks as
      shown below when you are on Question "Car Chase 0" of the Car Chase
      question sequence:

      <p align="center"><img src="CarChaseNavigation.gif" alt="Car Chase Navigation"></p>

      <p>To select the Tree Navigation mode, select "Navigation" from the
      Content menu, and then select "Tree".

      <p>To continue with the Car Chase question sequence, select "Car Chase
      1" from the Navigation tree.
