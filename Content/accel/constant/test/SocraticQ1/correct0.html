<br>

<div>A car (<font color="#3366FF">c</font>) with one headlight burned
out is traveling at a constant speed of 18 m/s and passes a stopped
police car (<font color="#FF0000">p</font>). The car is pursued
immediately by the police cruiser, which has a constant acceleration
of magnitude 2.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</div>

<div>(a) How far does the police cruiser travel before catching the
other car?</div>

<div>(b) At what time will this occur? (Hint: Graphing
may help to visualize this problem.)</div>

<div><hr WIDTH="100%"></div>

<div><font color="#FF0000">Correct!</font></div>

<div><img src="CarChaseCorrect.gif"></div>

<p>The acceleration of the police cruiser is constant in time, and
that of the car is also constant but equal to zero.

<p>Therefore the velocity of the cruiser increases linearly
in time from zero, and that of the car remains constant.

<p>The displacement of the car increases linearly in
time and that of the cruiser increases with <i>t</i><sup>2</sup>.

<p><b>Continue with Question "Car Chase (SQ)/Car Chase 1".  

<p>To simplify navigation to "Car Chase 1" and subsequent questions in
the Car Chase question sequence, the Tree Navigation mode is more
convenient.  In this mode, the navigation panel on the left looks as
shown below when you are on Question "Car Chase 0" of the Car Chase
question sequence:

<p>To select the Tree Navigation mode, select "Navigation" from the
Content menu, and then select "Tree".

<p>To continue with the Car Chase question sequence, select "Car Chase
1" from the Navigation tree.
