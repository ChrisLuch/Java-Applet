<div><b>Car Chase</b></div>

<br>

<div>A car (<font color="#3366FF">c</font>) with one headlight burned
out is traveling at a constant speed of 18 m/s and passes a stopped
police car (<font color="#FF0000">p</font>). The car is pursued
immediately by the police cruiser, which has a constant acceleration
of magnitude 2.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</div>

<div>(a) How far does the police cruiser travel before catching the
other car?</div>

<div>(b) At what time will this occur? (Hint: Graphing may help to
visualize this problem.)</div>

<div><hr WIDTH="100%"></div>

<p><font color="orange">Accumulated solution</font>: <br>

<p>Position of the car:

<p><i>x</i><sub>c</sub> = <i>v</i><sub>0c</sub><i>t</i>

<p>Position of the police cruiser:

<p><i>x</i><sub>p</sub> = <i>v</i><sub>0p</sub><i>t</i>

+ &frac12; <i>at</i><sup>2</sup> 

<p><hr WIDTH="100%">

<p>In order for us to find the distance traveled by the cars, which is
equal to their position at the time they meet, we must:

<blockquote>(a) set <i>x</i><sub>p</sub>
= <i>x</i><sub>c</sub> in the two equations and solve for <i>t</i>

<br>(b) set <i>x</i><sub>p</sub> = <i>x</i><sub>c</sub> = <i>x</i>
and eliminate <i>t</i> between the two equations.</blockquote>
