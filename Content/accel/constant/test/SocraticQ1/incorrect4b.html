<div><b>Car Chase</b></div>

<br>

<div>A car (<font color="#3366FF">c</font>) with one headlight burned
out is traveling at a constant speed of 18 m/s and passes a stopped
police car (<font color="#FF0000">p</font>). The car is pursued
immediately by the police cruiser, which has a constant acceleration
of magnitude 2.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</div>

<div>(a) How far does the police cruiser travel before catching the
other car?</div>

<div>(b) At what time will this occur? (Hint: Graphing may help to
visualize this problem.)</div>

<i>t</i> = 0 but we are asked for the later time when again they are
together.
