      <br>

      <div>A car (<font color="#3366FF">c</font>) with one headlight burned
      out is traveling at a constant speed of 18 m/s and passes a stopped
      police car (<font color="#FF0000">p</font>). The car is pursued
      immediately by the police cruiser, which has a constant acceleration
      of magnitude 2.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</div>

      <div>(a) How far does the police cruiser travel before catching the
      other car?</div>

      <div>(b) At what time will this occur? (Hint: Graphing may help to
      visualize this problem.)</div>

      <p><hr WIDTH="100%">

      <p><font color="#FF0000">No</font>.  They are certainly together at
      <i>t</i> = 0 but we are asked for the later time when again they are
      together.
