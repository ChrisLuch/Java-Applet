  <div class="title">Magnitude of the Radial Acceleration</div>

  <p><b>Preparation</b>:

  <p><ul>

  <li>Kinematics/Velocity/Circular Motion/Explain It/</li>

  <li>Kinematics/Acceleration/Radial (centripetal)/Explain It/Direction</li>

  </ul>

  <p>In this session, the following two expressions will be derived
  for the magnitude <i>a</i> of the acceleration of a particle moving
  with constant speed <i>v</i>, and constant angular speed <font
  face="symbol">w</font>, in a circle of radius <i>r</i>:

  <p align="center">
   <i>a</i> = <i>r</i> <font face="symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup> =
   <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>r</i>
  </p>

  <p align="center">
    <img src="Acc_VelandVel_Pos.gif" alt="Acceleration vs. Velocity">
  </p>

  <p>The derivation will be based on an analogy between acceleration
  and velocity that is illustrated in the image above.  The image
  shows two pairs of vectors.  All of the vectors are properties of
  the particle.  The velocity vector is shown twice, in different
  locations.

  <p><ul>

  <li><u>Pair 1</u>. Position vector <img src="r.gif" alt="vector r"
  align="bottom"> and velocity vector <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom">, the latter with its tail end attached to the tip of
  <img src="r.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom">.</li>

  <li><u>Pair 2</u>. Velocity vector <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom"> with its tail fixed at the center of the circle and
  the acceleration vector <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a"
  align="bottom">, with its tail end attached to the tip of <img
  src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>The derivation will be based on the fact that Pair 2 is analogous
  to Pair 1.  This analogy is a consequence of the analogy between the
  definitions of acceleration and velocity.  For a review of the
  definitions go to the links "Velocity" and "Acceleration" under
  Related Items.  The definitions imply that acceleration is related
  to velocity the way velocity is related to position.  The image
  shows that the acceleration vector is related to the velocity vector
  in Pair 2 as the velocity vector in Pair 1 is related to the
  position vector.

  <p>On Page 2, an applet will let you observe the analogy betwee
  Pairs 1 and 2 in motion.  Information on how to use the applet, in
  particular, on displaying the vectors shown in the image above, is
  available under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.  Set the
  speed of the particle to <i>v</i> = 0.25 m/s if you want to
  reproduce the image above.
