  <div class="title">Direction of the Acceleration in Uniform Circular Motion</div>

  <p><b>Preparation</b>: Kinematics/Velocity/Circular Motion/Explain
  It/

  <p>In this session, it will be explained why there is non-zero
  acceleration in uniform circular motion and why the direction of
  this acceleration is radial.  Another word used to describe the
  direction of this acceleration is <i>centripetal</i>.

    <img src="Acc_VelandVel_Pos.gif" alt="Acceleration vs. Velocity">
  </p>

  <p>The explanation will be based on an analogy between acceleration
  and velocity that is illustrated in the image above.  The image
  shows two pairs of vectors.  All of the vectors are properties of
  the particle.  The velocity vector is shown twice, in different
  locations.

  <p><ul>

  <li><u>Pair 1</u>. Position vector <img src="r.gif" alt="vector r"
  align="bottom"> and velocity vector <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom">, the latter with its tail end attached to the tip of
  <img src="r.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom">.</li>

  <li><u>Pair 2</u>. Velocity vector <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom"> with its tail fixed at the center of the circle and
  the acceleration vector <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a"
  align="bottom">, with its tail end attached to the tip of <img
  src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>The explanation will be based on the fact that acceleration is
  related to velocity as velocity as related to position.  Compare
  Pair 2 to Pair 1.  The analogy between these two relationships is a
  consequence of the analogy between the definitions of acceleration
  and velocity.  For a review of the definitions go to the links
  "Velocity" and "Acceleration" under Related Items.  

  <p>The explanation assumes you understand why 

  <blockquote>the direction of the velocity vector at a given instant
  coincides with the direction in which the tip of the position vector
  is moving at that instant</blockquote>

  <p>which means that the velocity vector when attached to the tip
  of the position vector as in Pair 1 lies along the tangent to the
  particle's path at the given instant.

  <p>For a review of this relationship between the velocity and
  position vectors, go to Page 2 and carry out the Activities on
  Velocity suggested in the link under Related Items.
