<div class="title">Activities on Acceleration in Circular Motion</div>

<p>In the following Activities, it is assumed that the applet's slider
settings are the default settings except when there are instructions
to the contrary.  In particular, make sure that the speed <i>v</i> of
the mass point is constant, i.e., that the <i>dv</i>/<i>dt</i>-slider
is set to 0.

<p><b>Activities</b>

<p><ol>

<li>Display the acceleration of the mass point such that the vector
has its tail end at the mass point (select "acceleration at particle"
in the Vector Panel).  Display no other vectors. Make sure the applet
is in the Continuous mode.  Display the position trace (Trace P), but
not the velocity trace (Trace V).  Set the initial speed of the mass
point to <i>v</i>(0) = 0.25 m/s.  Since the speed is constant, the
speed will be equal to 0.25 m/s at all times during the motion.  This
value for the speed will be used in all of the following Activities.

<p>Play the motion, and Pause it at several places.  Make a drawing
showing the path of the mass point and the acceleration vector at
different points of the path.

<p>In a sentence, describe the direction of the acceleration vector
of the mass point at different points of the path.  Adjectives used to
describe this direction are "radial" and "centripetal".  Are they
appropriate?</li>

<p><li>Activities 2 to 5 are intended to explain why the acceleration
in uniform circular motion has a radial direction.  The explanation is
based on the fact that the relationship of acceleration to velocity is
analogous to the relationship of velocity to position.  Compare the
definitions of the two quantities:

<blockquote>Acceleration is the time-rate-of-change of velocity while
velocity is the time-rate-of-change of position.</blockquote>

<p>Let's review the relationship between velocity and position.

<p>Reset the applet.  Set the initial speed to <i>v</i>(0) = 0.25 m/s,
and display the two vectors that in the Vector Panel are called
"position" and "velocity at particle".  

<p>Play the motion.  (For detailed suggestions on what to observe,
close this Activities window and go to Activities on Velocity.)  Can
you confirm the following general statement?

<blockquote>The velocity vector at a given instant points in the
direction in which the tip of the position vector is moving at that
instant, which is the direction of the tangent to the mass point's path
at that instant.</blockquote></li>

<p><li><p>Continuing from Activity 2, click Rewind, make sure the
applet is in the Continuous mode, and display a second velocity
vector, the one called "velocity at origin" in the Vector Panel, in
addition to the velocity-at-particle and position vectors already on
display.  The new velocity vector has its tail end fixed at the origin
and in that sense is like the position vector which has its tail end
fixed at the origin also.  Notice that the two magenta velocity
vectors are identical in magnitude and direction.  They differ only in
location.  Vectors can always be drawn wherever it is convenient.

<p>Play the motion, and observe how the two velocity vectors remain
identical throughout the motion.

<p>Click Rewind, and display the velocity trace (Trace V).  Then Play
the motion.  Observe that the trace (magenta) of the tip of the
velocity-at-origin vector is circular also, like that of the tip of
the position vector.  However, imagine the velocity vector and its
trace to be in a differenct space, called <i>velocity space</i>, shown
superimposed on position space, the space in which the position vector
exists.  The radius of the circular trace in velocity space is equal
to the magnitude of the velocity vector, which is <i>v</i> = 0.25
m/s.</li>

<p><li>Continuing from Activity 3, click Rewind.  Observe that the
velocity-at-particle vector points in the direction of motion of the
tip of the position vector.  Draw the configuration of these two
vectors and the position trace in your Notebook.  Then try to draw an
acceleration vector that has its tail end attached to the tip of the
velocity-at-origin vector and that points in the direction of motion
of the tip of this velocity vector.

<p>Check your prediction of the direction of the acceleration vector
by selecting "acceleration at velocity" in the Vector Panel, and Play
the motion.

<p>To focus on just the relationship of the acceleration and
velocity-at-origin vectors, hide the other two vectors and the
position trace by deselecting "position" and "velocity at particle" in
the Vector Panel and deselecting the Trace-P button.  Can you confirm
the following general statement?

<blockquote>The acceleration vector at a given instant points in the
direction in which the tip of the velocity-at-origin vector is moving
at that instant, which is the direction of the tangent to the velocity
trace at that instant.</blockquote></li>

<p>With the position and velocity-at-particle vectors still hidden,
display a second copy of the acceleration vector, the one called
"acceleration at particle" in the Vector Panel.  This is the vector
displayed in Activity 1 whose direction was called "radial" or
"centripetal".</li>

<p><li>Here is another way to demonstrate that the acceleration is in
the radial direction based on the analogy between the
acceleration-velocity and velocity-position relationships.

<p>Continuing from Activity 4, select "position", "velocity at
origin", and "acceleration at origin" from the Vector Panel, but no
other vectors.  Hide the position and velocity traces.  Thus, only
three different-colored vectors should remain on the screen, all of
them with their tail ends at the origin.

<p>Play the motion.  Since the velocity vector is 90<sup>o</sup> ahead
of the position vector, the acceleration vector should be
90<sup>o</sup> ahead of the velocity vector.  As the applet shows,
this makes the direction of the acceleration vector radial and
opposite to the position vector.

<p>By the way, when the acceleration vector is drawn with its tail end
attached to the origin, can its direction still be called
"centripetal" which is derived from Latin and means "center seeking"?
Referring to the direction as "radial" is still appropriate.

<p>Activities 2 to 5 are based on the analogy between the
acceleration-velocity relationship to the velocity-position
relationship.  Using this analogy, the activities show that the
direction of the acceleration in uniform circular motion is
radial.</li>

<p><li>The remaining three Activities are designed to provide an
understanding of acceleration in uniform circular motion that is based
solely on the definition of acceleration as time-rate-of-change of
velocity.

<p>Reset the applet, set it to the Incremental mode, and set the time
step to <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> = 0.50 s. Display only
the velocity-at-origin and acceleration-at-velocity vectors.  Display
the velocity trace (Trace V), but not the path of the particle (Trace
P).

<p>Use the Step button to take one step into the motion.  Make a
drawing of the velocity vectors <img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom"><sub>i</sub> and <img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom"><sub>f</sub> at the beginning and end of the time step,
the change in velocity vector <font face="symbol">D</font><img
src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> during the time
step, and the acceleration vector <img src="a_orange.gif" alt="vector
a" align="bottom"><sub>i</sub> at the beginning of the time step.
Estimate the angle between the change in velocity and acceleration
vectors.

<p>Click Rewind, reduce the time step to <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> = 0.25 s, and again take the first step
into the motion.  Again, draw all vectors and estimate the angle
between the initial acceleration vector and the change in velocity
vector.  Compare the situation to that for <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> = 0.50 s.  Can you see that the
direction of <font face="symbol">D</font><img src="v_orange.gif"
alt="vector v" align="bottom"> approaches that of <img
src="a_orange.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom"><sub>i</sub> as <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> decreases?

<p>Click Rewind, and repeat these observations once more for a time
step <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> = 0.10 s.  

<p>Acceleration is defined as the limit of the ratio <font
face="symbol">D</font><img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom">/<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> as <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> approaches 0.  As <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> approaches 0, does the direction of
<nobr><font face="symbol">D</font><img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector
v" align="bottom">/<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i></nobr>, which
is the same as that of <font face="symbol">D</font><img
src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">, approach the
direction of the acceleration at the beginning of the time interval?

<p>The change in velocity <font face="symbol">D</font><img
src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> forms a cord of the
circular velocity trace.  Do you observe that as <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> approaches 0 the direction of the cord
approaches that of the tangent to the path at the initial point of the
given time step?

<p>Can you confirm that the acceleration vector at a given instant
points in the direction in which the tip of the velocity vector is
moving at that instant, which is the direction of the tangent to the
velocity trace at that instant?</li>

<p><li>This activity is a repeat of Activity 6 with numbers. 

<p>Continuing from Activity 6, click Rewind, change the step size back
to <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> = 0.50 s, and display the Data
box.  Make sure the applet is still in the Incremental mode and that
no other settings have changed.

<p>Take one step into the motion.  Record the values of <font
face="symbol">D</font><img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom"> and <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>, and work out
the ratio <font face="symbol">D</font><img src="v_orange.gif"
alt="vector v" align="bottom">/<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> in
terms of its <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> scalar components.  Compare this ratio
to the initial acceleration <img src="a_orange.gif" alt="vector a"
align="bottom"><sub>i</sub>.

<p>Using the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> scalar components of <font
face="symbol">D</font><img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom">/<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> worked out above
and the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> scalar components of <img src="a_orange.gif"
alt="vector a" align="bottom"><sub>i</sub> listed in the Data box,
draw the two vectors <font face="symbol">D</font><img
src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">/<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> and <img src="a_orange.gif" alt="vector
a" align="bottom"><sub>i</sub>.  Draw them with their tail ends joined
for better comparison.  For better accuracy, you may want to draw the
vectors on graph paper.

<p>As in Activity 6, repeat this with time steps equal to 0.25 s and
0.10 s.

<p>Does <font face="symbol">D</font><img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector
v" align="bottom">/<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> approach
<img src="a_orange.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom"><sub>i</sub> as
the size of the time step decreases?

<p>The applet will let you choose time steps smaller than <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> = 0.10 s, but the values of <font
face="symbol">D</font><img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom">/<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> will become
unreliable as the time step becomes too small because of a loss of
significant figures.  This is evident visually as well because the
change in velocity vector <font face="symbol">D</font><img
src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> becomes hard to
recognize.</li>

<p><li>Repeat Activities 6 and 7 at a different time point.  E.g.,
after clicking Rewind, drag the mass point to a point with phase <font
face="symbol">d</font> = 1 rad. (<font face="symbol">d</font> is the
first item in the Data box).  Use this point as the initial point for
the time step. </li>
