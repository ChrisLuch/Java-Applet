  <div class="title">Direction of the Acceleration in Uniform Circular Motion</div>

  <p>Suppose a particle is moving at constant speed in a circle.

  <p>The following diagram shows the particle's path with the particle
  indicated by a black dot.  Which one of the four vectors indicated
  by a number in the diagram best represents the particle's
  acceleration when the particle is in the position shown?
