  <div class="title">Incorrect</div>

  <p><b>Hint</b>: In the case of circular motion, a particle's
  acceleration is non-zero even if the speed is constant.  The reason
  is that the particle's <b>velocity</b> is not constant, but changing
  direction.  Acceleration is the time-rate-of-change of velocity.

  <p>Think of an equation that expresses the magnitude of the
  time-rate-of-change of velocity.  How might this magnitude depend on
  <i>r</i> and <i>v</i>?
