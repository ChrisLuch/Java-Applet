  <p>The simulation on this page lets you observe the relationship
  between acceleration and velocity in more detail.</p>

  <p>Move the tip of the velocity vector along some path, by
controlling the acceleration in the acceleration dial. If you select
the TRACE button, the trace of the tip of the velocity vector will be
drawn. Then click REPLAY, which will restore the velocity vector to
its initial setting and show the initial acceleration vector attached
to the tip of the velocity vector. You can now step through the motion
in steps of equal time duration by clicking the STEP button
repeatedly. The acceleration vector at each stepping instant will be
shown attached to the tip of the velocity vector.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>: Is the acceleration vector at a given instant
tangential to the path of the tip of the velocity vector? </p>

<p><b>Question</b>: Is the magnitude of the displacement of the tip
of the velocity vector in one step proportional to the magnitude of
the acceleration at this time?</p>

<p>The answers to these questions should be YES.</p>
