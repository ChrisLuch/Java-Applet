<div class="title">(a) Circular Motion</div>

<p align="left">To start the motion, click anywhere in the simulation
window. To reset, click a second time.</p>

<p>The object (red) is interacting with a second object (yellow) while
performing circular motion.

<p>This kind of motion can be observed when a planet is revolving
around the sun, although in that case the motion of the yellow object
(sun) would be much less than shown here because the sun is so much
more massive than a planet.

<p>Note that the yellow object is revolving around a fixed point, just
like the red object.  In fact, both objects are revolving around the
same fixed point, namely, the center of mass of this two-body system.
