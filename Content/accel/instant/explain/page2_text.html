  <p>The simulation shows the velocity (magenta) and acceleration
  (orange) vectors of a swinging pendulum.  As you can see, they are
  constantly changing and, in general, point in different directions
  at any given instant.</p>

  <p>This session will provide an intuitive, qualitative explanation
  of how velocity and acceleration are related.  Both of them are
  vector quantities, and it is important to understand that
  acceleration is derived from <b>velocity</b>, which is a vector, and
  not from speed, which is a scalar.  This fact is at the core of some
  essential properties of acceleration.</p>

  <p>Let's now go to an exercise on Page 3, asking you to pick the
  unaccelerated motion(s) among four motions.</p>
