  <div class="title">Acceleration</div>

  <p>Have you asked yourself what the motion of an object in Position
  Space would look like that has the accelerations and velocities
  simulated on Pages 5 and 6?  The simulation will let you observe
  this motion as follows.</p>

  <p><b>Click</b> the toggle button labelled 'Object'.  A disk will be
  placed on the screen.  Clicking the button again, will make the disk
  disappear.  You can drag the disk anywhere in the applet
  window. This disk exists in Position Space which you can imagine to
  be placed on top of Velocity Space, transparently so that one can
  see Velocity Space underneath Position Space.</p>

  <p>You can set the velocity vector to an initial value and then
  control the motion with the acceleration dial as before.  The disk
  will move accordingly.  E.g., how about trying to make the disk
  perform projectile motion?  Hint: Place the disk in the lower
  left-hand corner of the screen, set the initial velocity to point
  upward and to the right, and then choose a constant acceleration
  vector that points straight down.  Observe the way the velocity
  changes during the motion.</p>

  <p>As on Page 6, you can click REPLAY and then step through the
  motion.  In the REPLAY mode, the acceleration vector will be shown
  attached to the disk.  <b>Observe</b> that, in any kind of motion,
  the acceleration either points to the inside of the disk's
  trajectory or along the tangent to the trajectory, but never away
  from the trajectory to the outside of the trajectory.  Why not?</p>
