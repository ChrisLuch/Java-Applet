  <div class="title">Acceleration</div>

  <p>Like velocity, the acceleration of an object is an
  <i>instantaneous</i> quantity that can vary from one instant to
  another.  One can therefore refer to it as <i>instantaneous</i>
  acceleration.  Usually, however, one simply says 'acceleration'.</p>

        \textsf{Since acceleration is a vector quantity, it is denoted
        by a vector symbol, usually \a.  There is no special name for
        the magnitude of the acceleration.  (The magnitude of the
        velocity has the special name 'speed'.)  The magnitude of the
        acceleration is a scalar and denoted by the letter
        \textit{a}. The SI-unit of acceleration is m/s\(^{2}\).

		  One also needs the concept of \textit{average acceleration}.  This
		  is an average of the (instantaneous) acceleration over a finite
		  time interval.  It is a vector denoted \a$_{av}$.

	<p>This session has presented an intuitive, qualitative
	understanding of acceleration.  Next you need to study the
	quantitative definition of acceleration and certain quantitative
	results about acceleration.  To do so, it is helpful to learn about
	average acceleration first.  Thus, it is recommended that you go to
	Acceleration/Ave. and Instant., then to Acceleration/Tangential, then
	to Acceleration/Radial (centripetal).</p>

	<p>If you want to experiment more with the simulations used in this
	session, go to Acceleration/Basic Facts/Simulate It.</p>
