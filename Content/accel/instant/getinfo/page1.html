  <div class="title">Acceleration - Definition and Equations</div>

  <p>The acceleration of a mass point is defined below.  Equations
  related to acceleration are given on Page 2.

  <p><b>Definition of acceleration in words</b>:

  <blockquote>Acceleration is the time-rate-of-change of velocity.</blockquote>

  <p><b>Definition of acceleration in symbols</b>:

    <img src="AccDefn1.gif" alt="Definition of Acceleration">
  </p>

  <p>In this definition, <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a"
  align="bottom"> denotes the acceleration at time <i>t</i> and <img
  src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> the velocity vector of
  the mass point.  The symbol &Delta;<img
  src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> denotes the change in
  velocity between the instant at time <i>t</i> and a later instant at
  time <i>t</i> + &Delta;<i>t</i>,

  <p align="center">
    &Delta;<img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom"> = <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom">(<i>t</i> + &Delta;<i>t</i>) -
  <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">(<i>t</i>).<img
  src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40">(2)
  </p>

  <p>The symbol <i>d</i><img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> is calculus notation for the more explicit
  notation with the limit symbol.  When the notation
  <i>d</i><img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> is
  used in physics, it is useful to think of <i>d</i><img src="v.gif"
  alt="vector v" align="bottom"> and <i>dt</i> as very small
  quantities and of the symbol <i>d</i><img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> as the ratio of these small quantities.

  <p><u>Comment 1</u>.  The ratio &Delta;<img
  src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">/&Delta;
  <i>t</i> behind the limit operation in the
  definition of acceleration is called <i>average acceleration</i>.
  With this concept, the definition of acceleration can be reworded as
  follows.

  <blockquote>The acceleration at time <i>t</i> is the limit of the
  average acceleration over a time interval extending from time <i>t</i>
  to time <i>t</i> + &Delta;<i>t</i> when &Delta;<i>t</i> goes to zero.</blockquote>

  <p>The acceleration defined in Eq.(1) is also called
  <i>instantaneous</i> acceleration because it is the acceleration at
  an instant of time, not the average acceleration over a time
  interval.  Usually, one simply says "acceleration" when one means
  "instantaneous acceleration".

  <p><u>Comment 2</u>. Acceleration is a vector quantity, arising from
  ratios that have a vector in the numerator and a scalar in the
  denominator.  The direction of the acceleration vector at a given
  instant is the direction in which the tip of the velocity vector is
  moving at that instant if the tail end of the velocity vector is
  being held fixed.  (Otherwise, the motion of the tip of the velocity
  vector would not represent changes &Delta;<img
  src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> in the velocity vector,
  as are needed in the definition of acceleration.)

  <p>With the tail end of the velocity vector held fixed, the tip of
  the vector describes a path.  Let's call it the <i>velocity
  path</i>.  At any given moment, the acceleration vector's direction
  is along the tangent to the velocity path at that instant.  See the
  following illustration which shows the velocity path of a mass point
  in magenta, three velocity vectors (in magenta) corresponding to
  three different instants of time, and the acceleration vectors (in
  orange) at these three instants.

  <p><u>Comment 3</u>.  The magnitude of the acceleration is a scalar
  quantity denoted either by <i>a</i> or |<img src="a.gif" alt="vector
  a" align="bottom">|.  It has no special name.

  <p><u>Comment 4</u>. The SI-unit of acceleration is m/s<sup>2</sup>.

  <p><u>Comment 5</u>. When a motion is along a straight line, say,
  the <i>x</i>-axis, most of the time one will be working with the
  scalar <i>x</i>-component <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> of the acceleration
  instead of the vector <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a"
  align="bottom"> and will be referring to <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> as
  "acceleration" instead of "<i>x</i>-component of acceleration", for
  brevity's sake. However, a vector and its scalar <i>x</i>-component
  are not the same thing.  The vector <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a"
  align="bottom"> does not change when the direction of the
  <i>x</i>-axis is reversed, but the scalar <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> has
  its sign reversed when the direction of the <i>x</i>-axis is
  reversed.  

  <p>One may even drop the subscript <i>x</i> and write just <i>a</i>
  instead of <i>a<sub>x</sub></i>, again for brevity's sake.  However,
  one should explain that <i>a</i> denotes the (<i>x</i>-component of
  the) acceleration, not the magnitude of the acceleration, unless
  this is clear from the context.

  <p><u>Comment 6</u>.  When an extended object is moving, its parts
  may be moving with different accelerations, e.g., the object may be
  rotating or the object may be vibrating.  In such cases, one cannot
  just speak of "the acceleration of the object".

  <p>In many cases, however, it will be possible to assume the object
  to be rigid and non-rotating.  In such cases, all parts of the
  object have the same acceleration and it makes sense to speak of
  <b>the</b> acceleration of the object.  In other cases, e.g., when the
  object is rotating in addition to performing some motion as a whole,
  one will mean the acceleration of the center of mass of the object when
  speaking of the object's acceleration.  This should be made clear,
  however, unless it is clear from the context.
