    <div class="title">Instantaneous Acceleration</div>

      <p><b>Preparation</b>:

      <p>

      <ul>

      <li>Acceleration/Basic Facts/</li>

      <li>Acceleration/Average/</li>

      <li>Velocity/Average/</li>

      <li>Velocity/Instantaneous/</li>

      </ul>

    <p>The applet on Page 2 lets you investigate the relationship between
    the position, velocity, and acceleration vectors in a motion that can
    be controlled through the acceleration vector.  In the Related Items
    area of the applet, there is a link to activities on acceleration to
    be carried out with the applet.

    <p>To start the motion, click in the Acceleration Dial.  Then drag the
    acceleration vector in the Acceleration Dial to control the
    acceleration.

    <p>Currently, no detailed information about the features of the applet
    is available from the applet's Help menu.
