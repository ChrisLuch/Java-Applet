    <p><b>Exercises</b>

    <p>

    <ol>

    <li><u>Constant Acceleration</u>.  See Page 3.</li>

    <p>

    <li><u>Uniform Circular Motion</u>. Try to make the car go around in
    a circle in position space by steering the acceleration with the
    Acceleration Dial.

    <p>Hint: Select the following check boxes: Velocity Space, Velocity
    Vector, Vel Path, Accel #2.  Set the initial velocity vector
    (magenta) to some non-zero value by clicking on the orange dot and
    dragging. Then start the motion with an acceleration vector (orange)
    that is perpendicular to the velocity vector, and keep adjusting the
    acceleration vector so that it stays perpendicular to the velocity
    vector.

    <p>When the tip of the velocity vector has traced out a circle (or
    nearly a circle) select Pos Path to check what the car's path looks
    like in position space.  You may want to deselect the Velocity Space
    check box at this point and then replay the motion by clicking
    REPLAY and then PLAY.  You may need to drag the screen during the
    motion to keep the blue position space path in the applet
    window.</li>

    <p>

    <li><u>From Position to Velocity to Acceleration</u>.  Create a
    motion for the car with the Acceleration Dial, and then replay the
    motion.  Observe the following:

    <p><ul>

    <li>Observe the motion with only the Pos Path and Velocity Vector
    check boxes selected.  Notice that the velocity vector is always
    tangential to the blue position path.  Then select also the Position
    Vector check box and notice that the velocity vector always points
    in the direction in which the tip of the position vector is moving
    and that it governs the motion of this tip (both the direction and
    speed with which the tip is moving).</li>

    <p>

    <li>Observe the same motion with only the Velocity Space, Vel Path,
    and Accel #2 check boxes selected.  Notice that the orange
    acceleration vector is always tangential to the magenta velocity
    path.  Then also select the Velocity Vector check box and notice
    that the acceleration vector always points in the direction in which the
    tip of the velocity vector is moving and governs the motion of this
    tip (both the direction and speed with which the tip is moving).

    <p>The lesson to be learned is that acceleration has the same
    relation to velocity as velocity has to position.</li>

    <p>

    <li>Observe the same motion with only the Pos Path and Accel #1
    check boxes selected.  Notice that the acceleration vector, whose
    tail end is now shown attached to the center of the car (represented
    by a dot when the car is not shown), always points to the inside of
    the car's path in position space or at most along the tangential
    direction, but never to the outside of this path.

    <p>Can you explain why this should be so?  Can you create a motion
    in which the acceleration vector, at least momentarily, points along
    the tangent to the car's path in position space?</li>

    </ul>

    <p>

    <li><u>Numerical Observations</u>.  Create a motion with the
    acceleration dial, replay it, and pause it at some point.  Select
    either Data #1 or Data #2 and use the data shown to predict the
    car's position and velocity at the next time step.  Then check your
    predictions by moving the motion one step forward in time by means
    of the STEP button.  One time step has a duration of 0.04 s.</li>

    <p>

    <li><u>Pendulum Motion</u>.  Try to create the motion of a simple
    pendulum, i.e., the car should move on a circular arc from left to
    right and back to the left.  This is not an easy task.

    <p>Hint: Work out the velocity space path corresponding to the
    motion of a simple pendulum.  Then try to create this path with the
    Acceleration Dial when only the Velocity Space, Vel Path, and Accel
    #2 check boxes are selected.  Use the orange acceleration vector as
    a guide in drawing the magenta velocity path.  Then select Pos Path
    to check how you have done.  You may want to deselect the Velocity
    Space check box at this point.</li>

    </ol>
