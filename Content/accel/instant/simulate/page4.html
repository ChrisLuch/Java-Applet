  <p><b>Exercises</b>

  <p>

  <ol>

  <li><u>Constant Acceleration</u>.  See Page 3.</li>

  <p>

  <li><u>Uniform Circular Motion</u>. Try to make the car go around in
  a circle in position space by steering the acceleration with the
  Acceleration Dial.

  <p>Hint: Select the following check boxes: Velocity Space, Velocity
  Vector, Vel Path, Accel #2.  Set the initial velocity vector
  (magenta) to some non-zero value by clicking on the orange dot and
  dragging. Then start the motion with an acceleration vector (orange)
  that is perpendicular to the velocity vector, and keep adjusting the
  acceleration vector so that it stays perpendicular to the velocity
  vector.

  <p>When the tip of the velocity vector has traced out a circle (or
  nearly a circle) select Pos Path to check what the car's path looks
  like in position space.  You may want to deselect the Velocity Space
  check box at this point and then replay the motion by clicking
  REPLAY and then PLAY.  You may need to drag the screen during the
  motion to keep the blue position space path in the applet
  window.</li>

  <p>

  <li><u>From Position to Velocity to Acceleration</u>.  Create a
  motion for the car with the Acceleration Dial, and then replay the
  motion.  Observe the following:

  <p><ul>

  <li>Observe the motion with only the Pos Path and Velocity Vector
  check boxes selected.  Notice that the velocity vector is always
  tangential to the blue position path.  Then select also the Position
  Vector check box and notice that the velocity vector always points
  in the direction in which the tip of the position vector is moving
  and that it governs the motion of this tip (both the direction and
  speed with which the tip is moving).</li>

  <p>

  <li>Observe the same motion with only the Velocity Space, Vel Path,
  and Accel #2 check boxes selected.  Notice that the orange
  acceleration vector is always tangential to the magenta velocity
  path.  Then also select the Velocity Vector check box and notice
  that the acceleration vector always points in the direction in which the
  tip of the velocity vector is moving and governs the motion of this
  tip (both the direction and speed with which the tip is moving).

  <p>The lesson to be learned is that acceleration has the same
  relation to velocity as velocity has to position.</li>

  <p>

  <li>Observe the same motion with only the Pos Path and Accel #1
  check boxes selected.  Notice that the acceleration vector, whose
  tail end is now shown attached to the center of the car (represented
  by a dot when the car is not shown), always points to the inside of
  the car's path in position space or at most along the tangential
  direction, but never to the outside of this path.

  <p>Can you explain why this should be so?  Can you create a motion
  in which the acceleration vector, at least momentarily, points along
  the tangent to the car's path in position space?</li>

  </ul>

  <p>

  <li><u>Numerical Observations</u>.  Create a motion with the
  acceleration dial, replay it, and pause it at some point.  Select
  either Data #1 or Data #2 and use the data shown to predict the
  car's position and velocity at the next time step.  Then check your
  predictions by moving the motion one step forward in time by means
  of the STEP button.  One time step has a duration of 0.04 s.</li>

  <p>

  <li><u>Pendulum Motion</u>.  Try to create the motion of a simple
  pendulum, i.e., the car should move on a circular arc from left to
  right and back to the left.  This is not an easy task.

  <p>Hint: Work out the velocity space path corresponding to the
  motion of a simple pendulum.  Then try to create this path with the
  Acceleration Dial when only the Velocity Space, Vel Path, and Accel
  #2 check boxes are selected.  Use the orange acceleration vector as
  a guide in drawing the magenta velocity path.  Then select Pos Path
  to check how you have done.  You may want to deselect the Velocity
  Space check box at this point.</li>
