  <div class="title">Activities on Acceleration</div>

  <p>The first set of four Activities is for constant acceleration.

  <p><ol>

   <li><u>Constant Acceleration</u>.  Display the velocity vector by
   checking the relevant checkbox in the Vector Panel. Also display
   the car's path (Position button).  Make no other changes to the
   applet's default settings.

	<p>Set the initial velocity to a direction upward and to the
	right (drag the velocity vector from the center of the car).
	Drag the car to the lower left-hand corner of the applet
	window.  Click in the Acceleration Dial at a 6 o'clock point
	(acceleration vector pointing downward), and hold the mouse
	steady with the mouse button depressed so that you are
	creating a motion with constant downward acceleration.  The
	car's path should be parabolic and look like a
	projectile-motion path without air resistance.</p>

	<p>Click the Rewind button, and display the Velocity Path
	(Velocity button).  A line in magenta will be shown indicating
	the path of the tip of the velocity vector.  Drag the car back
	to a suitable starting position, and Play the motion. Observe
	how the car follows the blue path in position path while
	simultaneously the tip of the velocity vector follows the
	magenta velocity path.

	<p>Click Rewind, and drag the car back to a suitable starting
	position.  Display also the acceleration vector, with its tail
	end attached to the velocity vector (check the Acceleration at
	Velocity checkbox in the Vector Panel).  Play the motion, and
	observe that the acceleration points along the velocity path
	at all times, just like the velocity vector points along the
	position path (i.e., along the instantaneous tangent to the
	position path) at all times.  Also use the STEP button to step
	through the motion rather than viewing the motion
	continuously.</p></li>

	<p><li><u>Constant Acceleration Cont'd</u>.  Continuing from
	Activity 1, click Rewind again, but this time select the
	Velocity Space mode (click Radio button) and hide the car's
	path (deselect Position toggle button).  Play the motion.

	<p>The motion will be shown with the tail end of the velocity
	vector fixed.  Observe how the tip of the velocity vector is
	moving along the straight velocity path (straight because the
	acceleration is constant).  You can hide the car (deselect the
	CAR toggle button) to concentrate better on the changes in the
	velocity vector.</p>

	<p>Repeat this experiment, but now also display the car's path
        in position space (Position button) and the position vector (check
        "Position" in Vector Panel).  The position vector will be
        shown in cyan.  Do this in Position Space mode (click radio
        button).  You can drag the window (click anywhere in the
        window) to bring all of the car's path into view.  Observe
        that the velocity vector points in the direction of motion of
        the tip of the position vector and is tangential to the blue
        position path and that the acceleration vector points in the
        direction of motion of the tip of the velocity vector and is
        tangential to the magenta velocity path.</p>

	<p> Repeat this in Velocity Sapce view.  Hide or display
	individual elements to focus on the remaining elements of the
	simulation.</li>

	<p><li><u>Constant Acceleration Cont'd</u>.  Continuing from
	Activity 2, put the applet into Position Space mode, and study
	the motion quantitatively by using the data in the Data box
	(select Data button).  The data should correspond to the
	familiar equations for motions with constant acceleration.
	There is a link to these equations under Related
	Items.</p></li>

	<p><li><u>Constant Acceleration Cont'd</u>.  Continuing from
	Activity 3, display both the Grid and the Data box.  Play the
	motion, and Pause it at some point.  Check that the
	<i>x</i>,<i>y</i> coordinates in the Data box are those of the
	tip of the position vector.  Then, with the control button
	depressed, click somewhere in the applet window and drag.
	This will change the coordinate system including the origin.
	Observe the change in the position vector, and again compare
	the coordinates of the tip of the position vector shown in the
	data display and exhibited graphically in the grid.  Observe
	that the velocity and acceleration vectors do <b>not</b>
	change.  Play the motion, and observe the three vectors while
	you change the position origin during the motion.</p></li>

	</ol>

	<p>Repeat all of the above with a constant acceleration in a
	different direction and with different initial velocities.

	<p>The following Activities are for non-constant acceleration.

	<p><ol>

  <li><u>Uniform Circular Motion</u>. Try to make the car go around in
  a circle in position space by steering the acceleration with the
  Acceleration Dial.

  <p>Hint: Put the applet into Velocity Space mode, and display the
  following vectors: velocity and acceleration at velocity. Display
  the velocity path, but not the position path.  Set the initial
  velocity vector (magenta) to some non-zero value by clicking on the
  center of the car and dragging. Then start the motion with an
  acceleration perpendicular to the velocity, and keep adjusting the
  acceleration vector so that it stays perpendicular to the velocity
  vector.  This is not easy to do, but try to keep adjusting the
  acceleration as well as you can.  Also, the magnitude of the
  acceleration should stay constant while the direction is changing.

  <p>When the tip of the velocity vector has traced out a circle (or
  nearly a circle) display the position path to check what the car's
  path looks like in position space.  You will probably find that this
  path looks even less circular than the velocity path.  You may want
  to switch to the Position Space mode at this point.  You may need to
  drag the screen during the motion to keep the blue position space
  path in the applet window.</li>

  <p>

  <li><u>From Position to Velocity to Acceleration</u>.  Create a
  motion for the car with the Acceleration Dial, click Rewind, and
  Play the motion.  Observe the following.

  <p><ul>

  <li>Observe the motion with only the position path and velocity
  vector displayed.  Observe that the velocity vector is always
  tangential to the blue position path.  Then display also the
  position vector, and observe that the velocity vector always points
  in the direction in which the tip of the position vector is moving
  and that the magnitude of the velocity vector is a measure of the
  speed with which the tip of the position vector is moving.</li>

  <p>

  <li>Observe the same motion in Velocity Space mode, with only the
  velocity path and acceleration vector (acceleration at velocity)
  displayed.  Observe that the orange acceleration vector is always
  tangential to the magenta velocity path.  Then also display the
  velocity vector, and observe that the acceleration vector always
  points in the direction in which the tip of the velocity vector is
  moving and that the magnitude of the acceleration vector is a
  measure of the rate at which the tip of the velocity vector is moving.

  <p>The lesson to be learned is that acceleration has the same
  relation to velocity as velocity has to position.</li>

  <p>

  <li>Observe the same motion with only the position path and the
  acceleration vector that has its tail end attached to the car
  displayed. Do this in Position Space mode.  Observe that the
  acceleration vector always points to the inside of the car's path
  in position space or at most along the tangential direction, but
  never to the outside of this path.

  <p>Can you explain why this should be so?  Can you create a motion
  in which the acceleration vector, at least momentarily, points along
  the tangent to the car's path in position space?</li>

  </ul>

  <p>

  <li><u>Numerical Observations</u>.  Reset the applet and create a
  some motion with the Acceleration Dial. Click Rewind, and Play and
  Pause the motion.  Display the Data box, and use the data
  to predict the car's position and velocity at the next time
  step.  Check your predictions by moving the motion one step
  forward in time by means of the STEP button.  One time step has a
  duration of 0.04 s.</li>

  <p>

  <li><u>Pendulum Motion</u>.  Try to create the motion of a simple
  pendulum.  The car should move on a circular arc from left to
  right and back to the left.  This is not an easy task.

  <p>Hint: Work out the velocity space path corresponding to the
  motion of a simple pendulum.  Then try to create this path with the
  Acceleration Dial with the applet in Velocity Space mode.  Display
  only the velocity path and the acceleration vector with its tail end
  at the velocity vector. (The velocity vector itself is not
  displayed.)  Use the orange acceleration vector as a guide in
  drawing the magenta velocity path.  Then display the position path
  to check how you have done.  You may want to switch the applet to
  the Position Space mode at this point.</li>
