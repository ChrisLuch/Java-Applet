        Monkey-and-Hunter Simulation With or Without Air Resistance
      </div>

      <p>
        The applet is on Page 2. The applet is identical to the Two-Balls
        applet, except that the air resistance is always zero for both balls.
        The initial conditions are such that the red ball will hit the yellow
        ball at some point during the balls' motions. (Monkey and Hunter
        set-up.)
