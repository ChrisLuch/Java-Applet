      <h1>Planet Motion</h1>
    </div>

    <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the motion of a planet around the
    sun (or another fixed star), or the motion of a moon or satellite
    around a planet.</p>  

    <p>For detailed information on how to use the applet, go to Applet
    Help on the applet's Help menu and look at Help and ShowMe.  A
    Lesson accompanying the applet is available there as well.
    </p>

    <p>The applet is available in two versions: "Planet Motion 1" and
    "Planet Motion 2".  The applet on Page 2, "Planet Motion 2", allows
    you to vary the shape of the planet's orbit by varying the orbit's
    energy and angular momentum.</p>

    <p>"Planet Motion 1", which is at Kinematics/Acceleration/Due to
    Gravity/Simulate It/Planet Motion/Planet Motion 1, lets you vary the
    shape of the orbit by varying the orbit's eccentricity and semi-major
    axis.</p>  

    <p>The orbit is defined either by the eccentricity and semi-major
    axis or by the energy and angular momentum.  In either version of
    the applet, the values of the pair of variables not set by the
    sliders are displayed in the data box.</p>
