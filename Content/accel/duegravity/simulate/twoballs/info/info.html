<p align="center"><b>
Simulation of Projectile Motion With or Without Air Resistance
</b></p>

<p>You can observe two balls simultaneously performing projectile
motion.  The initial positions and velocities of the two balls can be
set separately.  This way you can compare the motions of two balls
with different initial conditions.

<p>You can also compare the motion of a ball that is affected by air
resistance (yellow ball) to that of a ball not affected by air
resistance (red ball).  The amount of air resistance acting on the
yellow ball can be adjusted by varying the air resistance constant
<i>C</i> between 0 and 0.02 kg/m by means of a slider.

<p>The larger the value of <i>C</i>, the more air resistance there is.
The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components of the yellow ball's acceleration,
<i>a<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>a<sub>y</sub></i>, are equal to (the
x-axis is horizontal, the y-axis points vertically upward):

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="100"><i>a<sub>x</sub></i> =
-(<i>C</i>/<i>m</i>)<i>v</i><i>v<sub>x</sub></i>

<spacer type="horizontal" size="10"> and <spacer type="horizontal" size="10">

<i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = -<i>g</i> -
(<i>C</i>/<i>m</i>)<i>v</i><i>v<sub>y</sub></i>,</center>

<p>where <i>v</i> is the ball's speed, <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> and
<i>v<sub>y</sub></i> the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>-components of the
ball's velocity, respectively, <i>g</i> the magnitude of the
acceleration due to gravity, and <i>m</i> the ball's mass.

<p>The yellow ball's acceleration is a combination of the constant downward
acceleration due to gravity and a part due to air resistance whose
magnitude is proportional to the square of the ball's speed and whose
direction is opposite to the ball's velocity.

<p>You can vary the mass <i>m</i> of the yellow ball and observe how
such changes affect the ball's motion.  (The red ball's motion is
unaffected by changes in that ball's mass because the ball experiences
no air resistance.)

<p>You can vary the magnitude <i>g</i> of the acceleration due to
gravity.  This will affect both balls, and you can observe the
resultant changes in the balls' motions.

<p>The position coordinates of the two balls are printed out during
the motion vs. the time elapsed.  Also shown are the current direction
angles of the balls' velocities.

<p>You can also observe the following:

<ul>

<li><u>the balls' velocity vectors</u> - ball 1 in purple, ball 2 in
yellow; always displayed</li>

<i><u>the ball's velocity components</u> - the data entry fields for
the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components of the velocities of the two
balls are continually being updated during the balls' motions</li>

<li><u>the balls' trajectories</u> - in black; to display, click the Trace
toggle button.</li>

</ul>


<p>You have the following controls available:

<ul>

<li><u>the balls' initial positions</u> - drag the balls</li>

<li><u>purely vertical movement of the balls</u> - hold down the shift
key while dragging a ball</li>

<li><u><i>y</i>=0 level (<i>x</i>-axis)</u> - drag the tip of the
<i>x</i>-axis up or down at the right end of the axis</li>

<li><u>coordinate grid</u> - square grid; to display, click the Grid
toggle button.</li>

<li><u>the balls' initial velocities</u> - either drag the tip of the
velocity vector of a ball or type different values in the velocity
data fields (<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components of velocity of the ball)
and then hit RETURN</li>

<li><u>setting a target</u> - select the T toggle button and then click
at the desired target location; the target's <i>x</i>,<i>y</i>
coordinates are displayed as long as the mouse button is depressed;
the target can be dragged;  the target can be erased by clicking on
the target a second time</li>

<li><u>displaying the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> coordinates of a point</u> -
select the C button and then click on the point;  the point can
be dragged;  the display of the coordinates can be erased by clicking
on the point a second time</li>

<li><u>motion control</u> - clicking the PLAY button will run the
ball's motion continuously until you click the same button again and
the motion is paused; clicking the STEP button allows you to view the
motion in discrete time steps, one step at a time; a slider lets you
vary the size of the steps</li>

<li><u>reset and repeat</u> - clicking the RESET button restores the
applet to its default setting; clicking the REPEAT button restores the
applet to the initial setting chosen by the user; the user can change
settings after either RESET or REPEAT.</li>

</ul>
