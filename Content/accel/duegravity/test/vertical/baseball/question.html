<p align="left"><font face="Arial">A baseball pitcher throws a ball straight up into the
air.&nbsp; The ball eventually turns around and falls back down.&nbsp; Neglect air
resistance.&nbsp; Which of the following statements is correct?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">After release from the pitcher's hand, the ball's
acceleration</font></p>

<ol style="font-family: Arial" type="A">
  <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial">is downward at all times: on the way up, right at the
    top, and on the way down.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial">is upward at first, but decreases on the way up until
    it reaches zero at the top, then is downward on the way down.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial">on the way up is greater than the acceleration due to
    gravity and is directed upward, on the way down it is equal to the acceleration due to
    gravity and directed downward.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left"><font face="Arial">has a magnitude less than the acceleration due to
    gravity on the way up, is zero at the top, and is equal in magnitude to the acceleration
    due to gravity on the way down.</font></p>
