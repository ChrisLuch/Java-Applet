<p><u>Power dissipated in DC circuits</u></p>


<p>Suppose we have a resistor with resistance <i>R</i> and current
<i><font face="symbol">I</font></i>.  <spacer type="horizontal"
size="5">The potential difference across the resistor is <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> = <i>R<font face="symbol">I</font></i>.
<spacer type="horizontal" size="5">During an infinitesimal time
interval d<i>t</i>, an infinitesimal amount of charge d<i>q</i> is
entering the resistor at one end and an equal amount of charge is
leaving the resistor at the other end.  Then the electrical potential
energy transformed into thermal energy in the resistor during this
time interval is</p>

<div class="equation">|d<i>PE</i>| = |<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>| d<i>q</i> .</div>

<p>Thus, the power <i>P</i> dissipated in the resistor is</p>

<div class="equation"><i>P</i> = |d<i>PE</i>|/d<i>t</i> = |<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>| d<i>q</i>/d<i>t</i> = |<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>| <font face="symbol"><i>I</i></font>
.</div>



<p><b>Example</b>. A light bulb that has a 120-V potential difference
across it has a current of 0.625 A.  The power dissipated in the bulb
is <i>P</i> = 120x0.625 = 75 W.</p>

<p><b>Useful Equations</b>. Combining the equation for power
dissipation in a resistor with the definition of resistance, one can
calculate this power from any of the following three expressions:</p>

<div class="equation"><i>P</i> = (<font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>)<i><font
face="symbol">I</font></i> = (<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V)<sup>2</sup></i>/<i>R</i> = <i>R<font
face="symbol">I<sup>2</sup></i></font> .</div>


<p><b>AC Circuits</b></p>

<p>The preceding expressions apply also to AC circuits if all
quantities that are time-variable in the AC case, namely, potential
differences, currents, and emf's, are replaced by their rms-values.
An rms-value is a certain kind of average ('rms' stands for
root-mean-square, where 'mean' is another word for 'average'.)

<p>E.g., the 120-V potential difference between the poles of a
household plug is the rms-value of the time-variable potential
difference between the two poles.  Fifty times every second, the
potential difference between the poles goes from 170 V to -170 V back
to 170 V.  The rms-value of the potential difference between the poles
is equal to 170 V divided by the square root of 2.</p>

<p>All values for potential differences, currents, and powers in AC
circuits are usually quoted as rms values, unless something to the
contrary is explicitly stated.  Thus, a 120-V household bulb rated at
60 W has a current <font face="symbol"><i>I</i></font> <spacer
type="horizontal" size="5"> = 60/120 = 0.5 A, where all values are
rms-values.</p>
