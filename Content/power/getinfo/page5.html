  <div class="title">Power in Electrical Circuits</div>

<p><b>DC Circuits</b></p>

<p>Power is both supplied to and dissipated in DC circuits.  Suppose
the circuit consists of batteries and resistors.  The batteries supply
the power and the resistors dissipate it.  (A battery will in general
have some internal resistance, and power will be dissipated by this
internal resistance just like by any resistance external to the
battery.)</p>

<p>In supplying power to a circuit, a battery converts chemical into
electrical potential energy.  In dissipating power, resistors transform
electrical potential energy into thermal energy in the resistors.</p>

<p><u>Power supplied to a DC circuit</u>.  The so-called
<i>emf</i> of a battery, <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>, is defined by</p>

<p align="center"><i>V<sub>0</sub></i> = <i>W</i>/<i>q</i></p>

<p>where <i>W</i> is the work done by the battery on an amount of
charge <i>q</i> as the charge moves through the battery. This work
raises the electric potential energy of the charge by <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> = <i>W</i>. Another symbol used for
emf is <font face="symbol">e</font> (Greek letter: read
'epsilon').</p>

<p>Emf has the same physical dimension as electric potential
difference.  Both are defined as a ratio of either (work done on an
electric charge)/charge or (potential energy change of an electric
charge)/charge.  Therefore, the SI-unit of emf is the same as
that of electric potential difference, namely, the volt (V).</p>

<p>If at some instant of time an infinitesimal amount of charge
d<i>q</i> moves into the battery at one terminal and an equal amount
of charge leaves the battery at the other terminal during an
infinitesimal time interval d<i>t</i>, the amount d<i>PE</i> of
potential energy supplied by the battery to the circuit is</p>

<div class="equation">d<i>PE</i> = <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> d<i>q</i> .</div>

<p>Therefore, the electrical power transfer at this instant from the
battery to the circuit is</p>

<div class="equation"><i>P</i> = d<i>PE</i>/d<i>t</i> =
<i>V<sub>0</sub></i> d<i>q</i>/d<i>t</i> = <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> <font
face="symbol"><i>I</i></font></div>

<p>where <font face="symbol"><i>I</i></font> <spacer type="horizontal"
size="5">is the current in the battery at this instant.</p>

<p><b>Example</b>.  If a 12-V car battery (<i>V<sub>0</sub></i> = 12
V) has a current of 50 A while starting a car, the battery is
delivering a power <i>P</i> = 12x50 = 600 W to the circuit containing
the starter motor.</p>
