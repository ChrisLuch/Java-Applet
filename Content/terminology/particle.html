   <div class="title">Particle or Mass Point</div>

	<p>
     <b>Definition</b>.  A <i>particle</i>, also called <i>mass
     point</i>, is a model of a real object.  A particle is point-like
     and thus has all of its mass concentrated at one point.
   </p>

     <u>Comment 1</u>.  Being point-like, a particle has no internal
     structure and does not rotate.  A particle's motion is entirely
     translational.  A particle can have momentum, <img src="p.gif"
     alt="vector p" align="absbottom"> = <i>m</i> <img src="v.gif"
     alt="vector v" align="bottom">, and kinetic energy, <i>KE</i> =
     <i>m</i>/2 <i>v</i><sup>2</sup>, where <i>m</i> and <img
     src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> are the particle's
     mass and velocity, respectively, and <i>v</i> = |<img src="v.gif"
     alt="vector v" align="bottom">| the particle's speed.  A particle
     also can have angular momentum, relative to a point separate from
     the particle.
   </p>

     <u>Comment 2</u>.  Depending on the circumstances, a real object
     can either be represented by a particle or must be must be
     represented as an extended object.  Circumstances are common in
     which even very large objects, e.g., the earth or the sun, can
     usefully be represented by a particle.
