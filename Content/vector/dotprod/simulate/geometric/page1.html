    <div class="title">Dot or Scalar Product</div>


    <p>The dot product or scalar product of two vectors assigns to the
    vectors <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom"> and <img
    src="b.gif" alt="vector b" align="bottom"> a scalar (number) denoted
    <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom"><img src="dot.gif"
    alt="dot" align="bottom"><img src="b.gif" alt="vector b"
    align="bottom">.  Note the dot between the two vector symbols which
    gives the product one of its names.  The other name, "scalar product",
    comes from the fact that the <img src="a.gif" align="bottom"><img
    src="dot.gif" align="bottom"><img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> is a
    scalar.


    <p>You can experiment with the scalar product by varying either
    vector.  To change a vector, click on its tip and drag the tip with
    the mouse.

    <p>Observe how the dot product of the two vectors changes as you
    change the magnitudes of the two vectors or the angle between them, and
    check its value using the equation given in the control panel.
