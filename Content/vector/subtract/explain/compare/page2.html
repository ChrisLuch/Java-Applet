  <div class="title">Comparison Method</div>

<p>Two vectors are drawn on the screen and labeled.

<p>Suppose you want to determine the difference

<p align="center"><img src="../a.gif" align="bottom"> - <img
src="../b.gif" align="bottom">.</p>

<p>Draw these vectors on a sheet of paper, so that they are joined
tail-to-tail.  That way you can compare them.  The more their tips are
apart, the more different the vectors are.

<p>When done, go on to the next page to check your construction.
