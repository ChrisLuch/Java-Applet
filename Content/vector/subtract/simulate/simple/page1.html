      <h1>Subtraction Of Vectors</h1>
    </div>

      <p><b>Preparation</b>:

      <p><ul>

      <li>Vectors/Subtraction/Explain It/Add-the-Negative</li>

      <li>Vectors/Subtraction/Explain It/Comparison</li>

      </ul>

      <p>The applet on Page 2 will let you</p> 

      <ul>

      <li>draw two vectors,</li> 

      <li>find their difference graphically, either by the Add-the-Negative method or
      the Comparison method,</li>

      <li>compare the difference as drawn by you to the correct
      difference.</li>

      </ul>

  <div>Details on how to use the applet and a lesson on vector
  subtraction, including related calculations, are available under
  Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
