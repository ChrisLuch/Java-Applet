  <div class="title">The Concept Of Difference - From Numbers To
  Vectors</div>

  <p align="center"><img src="difference.gif"></p>

  <p><b>A Very Useful Remark About The Comparison Method</b></p>

      <p>The construction of the difference <img src="a.gif"
		align="bottom"> - <img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> by the
		comparison method relates directly to the physical
		interpretation of the difference as a <b>change</b>.  The points
		at the tips of the two vectors <img src="a.gif" align="bottom">
		and <img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> can be interpreted as
		positions of a particle at two different times, the point at the
		tip of <img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> being the position at an
		earlier time and that at the tip of <img src="a.gif"
		align="bottom"> at a later time.
		
		<p>The two vectors <img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> and <img
		src="b.gif" align="bottom"> can then be interpreted as the
		position vectors of the particle at the two times, relative to a
		fixed origin at the point where the two tail ends join.  Then
		<img src="a.gif" align="bottom">-<img src="b.gif"
		align="bottom">, the later minus the earlier position vector,
		represents the <b>change</b> in the particle's position vector
		during the given time interval, and this change points in the
		direction in which the particle's position is changing, which is
		from <img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> to <img src="a.gif"
		align="bottom">.  (Note that the change in a quantity is always
		the later value minus the earlier value.  E.g., if a number
		changes from 4 to 10, it changes by 6, and this change is equal
		to 10 - 4, the later minus the earlier value.)

		<p>More generally, when you have to construct the difference
		<img src="a.gif" align="bottom"> - <img src="b.gif"
		align="bottom"> of two vectors, think of the first vector, <img
		src="a.gif" align="bottom">, as the later value of some vector
		quantity and the second one, <img src="b.gif" align="bottom">,
		as the earlier value, think of <img src="a.gif" align="bottom">
		- <img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> as the change in the
		quantity, and then draw <img src="a.gif" align="bottom"> and
		<img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> tail-to-tail.  The change in
		the quantity, i.e., <img src="a.gif" align="bottom"> - <img
		src="b.gif" align="bottom">, will point from the tip of the
		earlier value <img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> of the quantity
		to the later value <img src="a.gif" align="bottom">.

		<p>The add-the-negative method allows no such interpretation
		because the green difference vector in that construction does
		not point from the earlier to the later value of any quantity.
		It points from the tail end of vector <img src="a.gif"
		align="bottom"> to the tip of vector -<img src="b.gif"
		align="bottom">, and these points do not have a physical
		interpretation.
