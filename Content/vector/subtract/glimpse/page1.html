 <div class="title">The Concept Of Difference - From Numbers To
  Vectors</div>

<p>Differences between vectors are important, e.g., in the definition
of velocity where one has to take the difference between the position
vectors of a particle, and divide this difference by a time elapsed.

<p>This session will be more than just a 'glimpse' of differences
between vectors. It could serve as a complete explanation of this
topic.  Nevertheless, in addition to reading the material here, you
should also work through Vectors/Subtraction/Explain It where the
process of vector subtraction will be explained with interactive
simulations.</p>

<p>The process of subtracting vectors and the concept of the
difference between two vectors are patterned on what is done with
numbers.  It may be helpful to review the situation with numbers
before going on to vectors.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to find a number <i>x</i> such that </p>

<p align="center">4 + <i>x</i> = 10.</p>

<p>Such a number exists, and it is called the <i>difference</i>
between 10 and 4.  We all know this difference is the number 6, but
here we are interested in the formal way of writing this
difference.</p>

<p>To arrive at this, let us solve the equation for <i>x</i>.  To do
so, we need to add the number (-4) to both sides of the equation.
(-4) is defined as the number that added to 4 gives 0: (-4) + 4 = 0.
Thus,</p>

<p align="center">4 + x + (-4) = x = 10 + (-4).</p>

<p>Thus, the difference of 10 and 4 is equal to 10 + (-4).  It is
customary to abbreviate this by 10 - 4.  The notation 10 - 4 is just a
shorthand for 10 + (-4).</p>

<p>Thus, the difference of 10 and 4 is a number denoted 10 - 4 which </p>

<ol>

<li>is the number that added to 4 gives 10,</li>

<p>

<li>is equal to 10 + (-4).</li>

</ol>

<p>These two properties of the difference of two numbers also apply to
the difference of two vectors.</p>
