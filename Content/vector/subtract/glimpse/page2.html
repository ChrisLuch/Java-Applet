 <div class="title">The Concept Of Difference - From Numbers To
  Vectors</div>

  <p>For the following material it is necessary that you have a good
  understanding of vector addition.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="difference.gif"></p>

      <p>Let us use Property 1 of the difference to find the
      difference between the two vectors <img src="a.gif"
      align="bottom"> and <img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> shown
      above.  Thus, we need to find a vector, denoted <img src="a.gif"
      align="bottom"> - <img src="b.gif" align="bottom">, that added
      to <img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> gives <img src="a.gif"
      align="bottom">,

		<p align="center"><img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> + (<img
		src="a.gif" align="bottom"> - <img src="b.gif" align="bottom">)
		= <img src="a.gif" align="bottom">.  

		<p>To find this vector you can arrange <img src="a.gif"
		align="bottom"> and <img src="b.gif" align="bottom">
		tail-to-tail, as in the diagram above, and then draw an arrow
		from the tip of <img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> to the tip of
		<img src="a.gif" align="bottom">, resulting in the green vector.
		Convince yourself that the green vector satisfies the given
		equation.

		<p>This way of finding the difference vector <img src="a.gif"
		align="bottom"> - <img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> will be
		called the <i>comparison method</i> here.  Reason: by joining
		the vectors tail-to-tail, we are comparing them.  The separation
		of the two tips is a measure of how <b>different</b> the two
		vectors are.  If the tips coincide, the vectors are the same and
		their difference is zero.
		
		<p>The comparison method takes advantage of Property 1 of the
		difference. On Page 3, the difference will be constructed using
		Property 2 of the difference.
