  <div class="title">Addition of Three Vectors</div>


   <p><b>Preparation</b>: Vectors/Addition/Explain It/Tip-to-Tail</p>

   <p>On Page 1, there is no applet in the applet area.  Just read the
   following overview.

   <p>The following demonstration will show how to add <b>three</b>
   vectors using the tip-to-tail method.</p>

   <p>This requires that you know how to add <b>two</b> vectors by
   this method.  For a review, go to the Preparation above.</p>

   <p>To practise adding three vectors, with your own choice of
   vectors, go to Vectors/Addition/Simulate It/Three Vectors.</p>

   <p><b>Note</b>.  The pages in this session are <b>not</b> randomly
     accessible.  Use the 'Go to next page' and 'Return to beginning'
