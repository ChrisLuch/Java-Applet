<p>Yes, the magnitude of the sum of the three vectors cannot be equal
to -15.  The reason is that no vector has a negative magnitude.  </p>

<p>It is possible for the sum of three vectors of magnitude 5 to have
a magnitude of +15, namely, when all three vectors point in the same
direction.  If they all pointed in the opposite direction, the
magnitude of their sum would still be +15.</p>
