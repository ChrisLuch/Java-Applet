        <p>The diagram shows how one can choose three vectors that
        all have magnitude 5 and that added together yield a vector
        of magnitude 0.</p>

		  <p>This is the null vector.  It is represented by a point, the
		  point that is common to the tail end of the first vector and
		  the tip of the third and last vector.</p>
