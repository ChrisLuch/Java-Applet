<p><b>Instructions</b>

<p>This page is designed to get you started using the applet. The
applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on this page are
to be done in the applet. You may need to toggle back and forth
between instructions and applet if your screen space is
limited.

  <p>If the applet window is not empty, clear it by pressing Reset
  <img src="reset.gif" align="top">.

  <p>Draw two vectors in the applet window.  To draw a vector, select
  the Vector tool <img src="vector.gif" align="top">; then click in
  the applet window and draw with the mouse.  You can change the
  vector by dragging either its tail or its tip.  You can move the
  vector without changing it by clicking it somewhere near its middle
  and dragging it.

  <p>To draw a second vector, repeat the procedure, beginning with the
  selection of the Vector tool.  The applet will not allow you to draw
  more than two vectors.

  <p>The applet will label the two vectors <img src="a.gif"
  align="bottom"> and <img src="b.gif" align="bottom">.

  <p>Try to draw two vectors and arrange them like those on Figure 1
  below.

  <p align="center"><img src="VectorAddtwovectors.jpg"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></li>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"

<p>

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="MySum">Constructing The Resultant (Sum)</a></div>

  <p><u>(a) Tip-to-Tail Method</u>.  Arrange the two vectors so that
  the tail-end of vector <img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> is aligned
  with the tip of vector <img src="a.gif" align="bottom">.  Note that
  the exact tail ends and tips of the vectors are marked by a tiny
  black dot.  To achieve an exact join, place the appropriate dots on
  top of each other.  To move a vector without changing it, drag it at
  its middle.

  <p>When done, the vectors should be arranged as shown in Figure 2
  below.

  <p align="center"><img src="VectorAddjoin.jpg"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

  <p>To draw the resultant, select the Draw-Your-Sum button <img
  src="resultant.gif" align="top"> and draw the vector.  It will be
  drawn in blue and labeled "my sum" by the applet.  The following
  Figure 3 shows a vector that has been drawn this way, but it is not
  the correct resultant.  If you have drawn an incorrect resultant,
  you can change and move the vector as described under Section 1
  above.

  <p align="center"><img src="VectorAddmysum.jpg"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 3</b></p>

  <p><u>(b) Parallelogram Method</u>. Here the two vectors have to be
  joined tail end to tail end, as in Figure 4 below.  Again, observe
  how the dots marking the tail ends of the two vectors coincide in
  Figure 4. 

  <p>To complete the parallelogram, auxiliary lines must be
  drawn parallel to the given vectors.  The applet lets you draw
  dotted lines for this purpose.  Select the Draw-a-Dotted-Line button
  <img src="dottedline.gif" align="top"> and then draw a line.  Figure
  4 shows such a dotted line.

  <p>To make a line exactly parallel to one of the vectors, you can
  change its orientation by dragging either end of the line.  To move
  the line without changing its orientation, drag it at its middle.

  <p align="center"><img src="VectorAdddotted.jpg"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 4</b></p>

  <p>Once you have constructed the parallelogram, draw
  the resultant after selecting the Draw-Your-Sum button <img
  src="resultant.gif" align="top"> as described under "Tip-to-Tail
  Method" above.

  <p><div class="sectionheading">

  <p>Once you have drawn your resultant, the Answer button <img
  src="Answer.gif" align="top"> becomes active.  When you press this
  button, the applet will draw the correct resultant in green.

  <p>If you do this when the applet displays a configuration as in
  Figure 3, you should see something like what is shown in Figure 5
  below.

  <p align="center"><img src="VectorAddanswer.jpg"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 5</b></p>

  <p>You can drag your sum over to the correct sum, labeled <img
  src="a.gif" align="bottom"> + <img src="b.gif" align="bottom">, or
  the correct sum over to yours to compare the two vectors.
