<div class="sectionheading">The Applet Allows Graphical Addition Of
 Two Vectors By The Tip-to-Tail And Parallelogram Methods</div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p><b>Prerequisite</b>

<p>Students should know about the basic vector properties of magnitude
and direction.

<p><b>Learning Outcomes</b>

<p>Students will be able to graphically add two vectors by the
Tip-to-Tail and Parallelogram methods.

<p><b>Instructions</b>

<p>Students should know how the applet functions, as described in Help and
ShowMe.

<p>The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in the
following text are to be done in the applet. You may need to toggle
back and forth between instructions and applet if your screen space is
limited.

  Resultant (Sum)</div></a>

  <p>There are two methods for constructing the sum of two vectors
  graphically: the Tip-to-Tail Method and the Parallelogram method.
  These methods will now be demonstrated.  Note that another word for
  "sum of two (or more) vectors" is <i>resultant</i>.

  <p>If you wish to add more than two vectors, you can first add any
  two vectors, then add their resultant to a third vector, etc.  The
  order in which the vectors are added is immaterial, because vector
  addition obeys the commutative and associative laws.

  <a name="TipTail"><p><u>(a) Tip-to-Tail Method</u>.</a>  

  <p>If the applet screen is not empty, clear it by pressing Reset
  <img src="reset.gif" align="top">.

  <p>Draw two vectors in the applet window. The applet will label the
  two vectors <img src="a.gif" align="bottom"> and <img src="b.gif"
  align="bottom">.

  <p>Arrange the two vectors so that the tail-end of vector <img
  src="b.gif" align="bottom"> is aligned with the tip of vector <img
  src="a.gif" align="bottom">.  

  <p>When done, the vectors should be arranged as shown in Figure 1
  below.  (For the purpose of following this lesson, you may want to
  adjust your vectors to look like those in Figure 1.)

  <p align="center"><img src="VectorAddjoin.jpg"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

  <p>To draw the resultant, select the Draw-Your-Sum button <img
  src="resultant.gif" align="top"> and draw the vector from the free
  tail end of the arrangement shown in Figure 1 to the free tip. (Not
  the other way around!) The result is illustrated in Figure 2
  below. The applet draws your resultant in blue and labels it "my
  sum".  The resultant shown in Figure 2 is the correct resultant.

  <p align="center"><img src="VectorAddtiptailcorrect.jpg"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

  <p>Here is an easy way to remember in which direction to draw the
  resultant.  Think of the two vectors as displacements, one
  displacement following another.  Then the resultant is the overall
  (net) displacement, from the point where the first displacement
  starts to the point where the second displacement finishes.

  <p>Once you have drawn your resultant, the Answer button <img
  src="Answer.gif" align="top"> becomes active.  When you press this
  button, the applet will draw the correct resultant in green and
  label it <img src="a.gif" align="bottom"> + <img src="b.gif"
  align="bottom">. 

  <p>You can compare your resultant to the correct resultant by
  dragging yours next to the correct one, as shown in Figure 3 below,
  or make the two overlap completely.  You can also move the correct
  resultant.

  <a name="Parallelogram"><p><u>(b) Parallelogram Method</u>.</a> 

  <p>If the applet screen is not empty, clear it by pressing Reset
  <img src="reset.gif" align="top">.

  <p>Draw two vectors in the applet window. The applet will label the
  two vectors <img src="a.gif" align="bottom"> and <img src="b.gif"
  align="bottom">.  (For the purpose of following this lesson, you may
  want to adjust your vectors to look like those in Figure 4 below.)

  <p>Join the two vectors tail end to tail end, as in Figure 4.

  <p align="center"><img src="VectorAddtail.jpg"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 4</b></p>

  <p>Think of these two vectors as spanning a parallelogram, i.e., as
  forming two sides of a parallelogram whose other two sides still
  need to be constructed.

  <p>The applet lets you draw the remaining two sides of the
  parallelogram with dotted lines.  The result is shown in Figure 5
  below, including the correct resultant as drawn by the student.  The
  resultant vector goes from the point where the tail ends of the
  vectors join to the opposite corner of the parallelogram.  (For
  drawing the resultant, see the section on the Tip-to-Tail method
  above.)

  <p align="center"><img src="VectorAddparallelogram.jpg"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 5</b></p>

  <p><u>Hint</u>. To make sure that the dotted lines are parallel to
  the given vectors, draw the lines initially on top of the two
  vectors.  Then move them into their correct positions by making them
  intersect the tips of the respective vectors.

  <p>Finally, you can compare your resultant to the correct resultant
  drawn by the applet as described at the end of the section on the
  Tip-to-Tail method.

  <p><b>Exercise</b>. Demonstrate that the two methods lead to the
  same resultant by rearranging the vectors <img src="a.gif"
  align="bottom"> + <img src="b.gif" align="bottom"> when they are
  aligned as in Figure 5 into the tip-to-tail alignment shown in
  Figure 2.  It should be apparent that the same resultant applies in
  both cases.  All you need to do is to move vector <img src="b.gif"
  align="bottom"> onto the opposite side of the parallelogram that is
  occupied by a dotted line.

  <p>You could also move vector <img src="a.gif" align="bottom"> onto
  the side opposite to it and that way demonstrate that it does not
  matter which vector is put down first and which vector joined to it
  in the Tip-to-Tail method.
