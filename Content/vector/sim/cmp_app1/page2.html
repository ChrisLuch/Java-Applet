<p align="center">On the left you see a vector <b><img src="../a.gif"></b> and 
  a set of x,y axes. The divisions on the axis are one unit apart. The x,y components 
  of the vector <b><img src="../a.gif"></b> are printed out below.</p>
<p align="center">You can rotate the axes, by clicking on the tip of the y-axis 
  or the x-axis and moving the mouse while holding the mouse button down.</p>
<p align="center">Observe how the components of <b><img src="../a.gif"></b> change 
  as the axes are changed, even though <b><img src="../a.gif"></b> never changes.</p>
<p align="center">You may want to verify that the magnitude (absolute value) of 
  the vector <b><img src="../a.gif"></b> does not change as its components are 
  changeing by working out the equation below.</p>
