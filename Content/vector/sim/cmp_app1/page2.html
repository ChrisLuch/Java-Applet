    <p align="center">On the left you see a vector <b><img src="../a.gif"></b> and 
      a set of x,y axes. The divisions on the axis are one unit apart. The x,y components 
      of the vector <b><img src="../a.gif"></b> are printed out below.</p>
    <p align="center">You can rotate the axes, by clicking on the tip of the y-axis 
      or the x-axis and moving the mouse while holding the mouse button down.</p>
    <p align="center">Observe how the components of <b><img src="../a.gif"></b> change 
      as the axes are changed, even though <b><img src="../a.gif"></b> never changes.</p>
    <p align="center">You may want to verify that the magnitude (absolute value) of 
      the vector <b><img src="../a.gif"></b> does not change as its components are 
      changeing by working out the equation below.</p>
