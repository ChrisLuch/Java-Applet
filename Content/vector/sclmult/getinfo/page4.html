  <div class="title">Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar</div>

<p>The scalar multiplication of vectors obeys the general rule:

 <p align="center"><i>a</i>(<i>b</i><img src="v.gif" align="bottom">)
 = (<i>ab</i>)<img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> = <i>b</i>(<i>a</i><img
 src="v.gif" align="bottom">),</p>

<p>where <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> is a vector and <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i> are two scalars.  E.g.,

<p align="center">3(-5<img src="v.gif" align="bottom">) = (-15)<img
src="v.gif" align="bottom"> = -5(3<img src="v.gif" align="bottom">).</p>

  <p>You can verify this graphically by drawing the various vectors.


<p>When a vector <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> is multiplied by the
  number 0, one obtains a vector of magnitude zero. This vector,
  represented graphically by a point, is called the <i>null
  vector</i>. Its symbol, 0, looks just like the symbol for the scalar
  zero.  One does not use an arrow above '0' to indicate that one is
  dealing with the null vector rather than the number zero, because it
  will be clear from the context which is which.


<p>The vector -<img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> is defined so that
<img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> + (-<img src="v.gif" align="bottom">)
= 0, where 0 is the null vector.

<p>There is only one null vector.  All vectors, no matter what their
direction, will give the same null vector after multiplication by the
number 0. A geometrical point has no direction.

<p>Multiplying a vector <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> by the number
1 gives again the same vector <img src="v.gif" align="bottom">.
