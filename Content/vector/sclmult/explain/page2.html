  <div class="title">Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar</div>

<p>In the simulation on the left, choose the vector you want to
multiply by a scalar.

<p>You can choose your vector by dragging the tip of the yellow arrow
  (by clicking on it and moving the mouse with the mouse button
  depressed).

<p>On the next page you will be able to graphically multiply the
vector by a scalar.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>. What vector will you get when you multiply the vector by 2,
or -1.5?  Try to draw the resulting vectors on a sheet of paper.
