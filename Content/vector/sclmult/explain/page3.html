  <div class="title">Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar</div>

<p>Arrange the two vectors so that one of them is equal to 2 times
the other one, or -1.5 times the other one.

<p>To do so, you must change either one or both vectors.  You can
change either vector by dragging its tip.  Observe how the equation
changes.

<p>You may need more space to draw a vector to its necessary length.
For this purpose, you can move either vector by dragging it near its
midpoint.

<p><b>Dividing a vector by a scalar</b>.  One often needs to divide a
vector by a scalar. E.g., to calculate an average velocity one needs
to divide a displacement (vector) by a time elapsed (scalar).
Dividing a vector by, say, 2 is the same as multiplying it by 0.5.  In
general, dividing a vector by the scalar <i>a</i> is the same as
multiplying it by the reciprocal 1/<i>a</i>.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>. A vector of magnitude 6 pointing northeast gets
divided by the scalar -2.  What is result?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>. Dividing by -2 is the same as multiplying by -0.5.
Thus the resulting vector is a vector of magnitude 6x(0.5) = 3 that
has its direction reversed, i.e., that points southwest.</p>

<p>One can also say that in order to divide a vector by a scalar one
has to divide the magnitude of the vector by the absolute value of the
scalar and reverse the direction if the scalar is negative, otherwise
not change the direction.</p>
