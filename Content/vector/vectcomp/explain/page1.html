<P>Vector components of vectors must be distinguished from scalar
components of vectors.  The former are vectors, the latter are scalars
(numbers).  See "Scalar Components" under Get Information.

<p>The illustration on the left shows an example where vector
components are useful.  The green vector in the diagram is the weight
force acting on the block.  Its two vector components are in red.

<P>Vector components of vectors will now be explained graphically and
then related to scalar components.
