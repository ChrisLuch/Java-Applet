{\sf The diagram shows a vector $\A$. Draw two more vectors on the
screen that added together are equal to $\A$. The two vectors should
be orthogonal to each other.  The program will label these vectors
$\A_\1$ and $\A_2$.  They are called textit{vector components} of $\A$.

\par

To draw a vector or a line or dotted line, select the appropriate tool
        button and then draw with the mouse. To delete an item,
        select it (by clicking on it) and then press DELETE. 
\par
When you have drawn two component vectors on the screen, the
  program will automatically display their sum in green if it equals
  $\A$ within a reasonable margin, and if the two component vectors
  are reasonably orthogonal to each other.  Otherwise the sum will be
  shown in red.

\par

The angle between your two component vectors is indicated at the
  bottom. Your task is to construct two vectors such that this angle
  is 90 degrees and the resultant vector turns green.
\par
You can drag any of the vectors or lines on the screen,
  except for the vector in red (or green). You can change any of the
  vectors or lines that you have drawn by clicking on them at one of
  their endpoints and then dragging this endpoint.} "
