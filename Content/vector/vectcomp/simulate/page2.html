    {\sf The diagram shows a vector $\A$. Draw two more vectors on the
    screen that added together are equal to $\A$. The two vectors should
    be orthogonal to each other.  The program will label these vectors
    $\A_\1$ and $\A_2$.  They are called textit{vector components} of $\A$.

    \par

    To draw a vector or a line or dotted line, select the appropriate tool
            button and then draw with the mouse. To delete an item,
            select it (by clicking on it) and then press DELETE. 
    \par
    When you have drawn two component vectors on the screen, the
      program will automatically display their sum in green if it equals
      $\A$ within a reasonable margin, and if the two component vectors
      are reasonably orthogonal to each other.  Otherwise the sum will be
      shown in red.

    \par

    The angle between your two component vectors is indicated at the
      bottom. Your task is to construct two vectors such that this angle
      is 90 degrees and the resultant vector turns green.
    \par
    You can drag any of the vectors or lines on the screen,
      except for the vector in red (or green). You can change any of the
      vectors or lines that you have drawn by clicking on them at one of
      their endpoints and then dragging this endpoint.} "
