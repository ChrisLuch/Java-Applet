<p>Yes, "northwest at 30 m/s" is a complete specification of a car's
velocity.  It indicates both the direction and the magnitude of the
velocity.  Both of these attributes are essential in specifying a
vector.</p>

<p>Note that there is another very convenient way to specify a vector,
which is to specify a vector in terms of its components.  (See
Vectors/Scalar Components.)  This is just as good as specifying the
magnitude and direction.  The point of saying that 'direction and
magnitude both need to be specified' is that it is not enough to
specify only <b>one</b> of these.  The point is <b>not</b> that this
is the <b>only</b> way of specifying a vector.</p>
