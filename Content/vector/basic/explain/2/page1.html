  <div class="title">Vector Specification</div>

  <p>A vector in two dimensions needs two numbers for its
  specification.  Four different ways (modes) of choosing these two
  numbers are demonstrated here, on four different pages.

  <p><u>1. Polar (positive)</u>. In this mode, a vector is specified by
its magnitude and by an angle where the angle is measured from a reference
line, shown dotted and pointing east, in the positive
(counter-clockwise) sense.  The angle is indicated by an arc.  Angles can
range from 0 to 360<sup>o</sup>.  360<sup>o</sup> is equivalent to
0<sup>o</sup>.

<p>The applet is now set to this mode.  Enter 150 for the magnitude
and 240<sup>o</sup> for the angle.  You should get the display shown
below.
