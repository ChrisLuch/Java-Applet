  <div class="title">Vector Specification</div>

  <p><u>4. Cartesian <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> Components</a></u>.  The
  applet is now set to this mode.  Drag the vector by its tip and
  observe how its Cartesian compoents
  (<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) change.  Do the same by
  dragging the origin of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes.

<p>The projections of the vector onto the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes,
shown in green and yellow, respectively, are called the <i>scalar
components</i> of the vector.  They are called <b>scalar</b>
components because they are numbers.  The scalar components are equal
to the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of the tip of the vector if
the tail end of the vector is at the origin of the coordinate system,
as it is here.

<p>The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> scalar components of a vector <img
src="v.gif" align="bottom"> are denoted <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> and
<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>, respectively.  

<p>Return to Page 1 for a moment and set the magnitude and angle in
the Polar (positive) mode to 150 and 240<sup>o</sup>.  Then return to
Page 4. You should find the components to have the values

<p align="center">(<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) =
(-75,-129.90) .</p>

<p>You can use the notation
(<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) to denote the vector <img
src="v.gif" align="bottom">, because the vector is fully specified in
terms of its two scalar components.  Thus, when you are required to
calculate a vector <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> you can give your
final answer as in the equation above.  This is quite alright.  There
is no need to calculate the magnitude and direction of the vector.
The magnitude and direction contain no more information than the
components.

<p>Or you could state your final answer in the form

<p align="center"><img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> = (-75,-129.90) .</p>

<p>However, when describing a vector by its two components, it must be
understood from the context how the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes are
defined.  Otherwise, you must explicitly state how the axes are defined.

<p>For more detail on scalar components and how to calculate with
them, go to Vectors/Scalar Components.
