   <p>The direction of a vector can be measured by the angle between
   the vector and the 'eastward' direction (dotted line).</p>

   <p><b>Drag</b> the tip of the vector.  (Click the tip of the vector, and
       move the mouse with the mouse button depressed.)  Investigate
       for what directions the angle is positive or negative.</p>

   <p>The angle could also be defined differently from the way it is
   done here.  E.g., it could be defined so that it is positive
   all the way around, increasing from 0 to 360<sup>o</sup> as the
   vector rotates counter-clockwise.</p>
