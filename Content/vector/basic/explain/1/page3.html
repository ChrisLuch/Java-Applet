     <p><b>Draw</b> a vector by clicking in the drawing area and moving
        the mouse with the mouse button depressed.

       <p>The direction angle is again measured relative to a
       horizontal axis pointing to the right, as on Page 2.  This axis
       is not shown here.  Values for the vector's magnitude and
       direction angle are displayed at the bottom of the applet
       window.

		 <p>It is important to have a notation that distinguishes
		 between a vector and its magnitude, because the magnitude is
		 only part of the vector. (The direction is the other part.)

         <p><b>Notation</b>. It is common practice to denote a vector
         quantity with an arrow over the letter, e.g., <img
         src="a.gif" align="bottom">.  The arrow indicates that <img
         src="a.gif" align="bottom"> has direction, in addition to
         magnitude.

         <p>Textbooks use boldface symbols to denote vectors, e.g.,
         <b>a</b>.  In handwriting one uses an arrow over the letter.
         In MAP, we are using both boldface and arrows.  Some
         textbooks follow this practice as well.

			<p> The magnitude of the vector <img src="a.gif"
         align="bottom"> is denoted by the same letter <i>a</i>, but
         without an arrow because it is a scalar, i.e., a number.

			<p>There are cases where it is ambiguous if one denotes a
         magnitude by a plainface letter without an arrow.  In those
         cases, and in all other cases, one can denote the magnitude
         by |<img src="a.gif" align="bottom">| because the magnitude
         of a vector is the same as the <i>absolute value</i> of the
         vector.

         <p><b>Important</b>. Do get into the habit right away of
         using an arrow to denote a vector quantity.  It will be very
         confusing if in writing equations you don't make it clear
         which quantities are vectors and which ones are scalars.
