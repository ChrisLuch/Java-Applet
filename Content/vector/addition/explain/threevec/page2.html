  <div class="title">Addition of Three Vectors</div>


   <p>Three vectors are drawn on the screen and labeled.</p>

   <p><b>Task</b>: In your notebook, draw the three vectors and try to find their sum.</p>

   <p>Do this by joining the three vectors tip-to-tail: first the tail end of the second vector to the tip of the first one, then the
     tail of the third vector to the tip of the second one.</p>

   <p>It does not matter which vectors you take to be the first, second, and third vectors.</p>

   <p>When done, go on to the next page to compare.</p>
