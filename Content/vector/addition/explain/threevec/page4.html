  <div class="title">Addition of Three Vectors</div>


   <p>The sum of the three vectors is shown in green.</p>

   <p><b>Final Comments</b></p>

   <p>If the vectors represent displacements, the green vector
   represents the same overall displacement as the three other
   displacements taken in succession.</p>

   <p>The sum of the three vectors is independent of the order in
   which the vectors are joined.  Try it.  Vector addition is
   commutative.</p>

   <p>Now, in your Notebook, draw three vectors of your own and
   explain how to construct their resultant (sum).</p>
