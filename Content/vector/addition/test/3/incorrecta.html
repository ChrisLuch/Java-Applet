  <div class="title">Incorrect</div>

  <p>Choice (a) is not correct. It represents a
   vector that is in the opposite direction from the sum of the two
   given vectors.</p>

<p>On a sheet of paper, draw the two vectors so that the tail of one
      vector is placed at the tip of the other vector.  (You will have
      to draw the second vector a bit offset to one side, so that the
      two vectors aren't superimposed and you can see what you are
      doing.)</p>

		<p>Then draw the arrow from the free tail of one of the
      vectors to the free tip of the other vector. This will represent
      the sum of the two vectors. </p>
