      <p>The applet on Page 2 will let you</p>

      <ul>
        <li>draw two vectors,</li>

        <li>
          find their sum graphically, either by the tip-to-tail method or the
          parallelogram method,
        </li>

        <li>
          and compare the resultant as drawn by you to the correct resultant.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Details on how to use the applet and a lesson on vector addition,
        including related calculations, are available from the Help menu of the
        applet.
