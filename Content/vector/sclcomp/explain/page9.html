  <div class="title">Scalar Components of Vectors</div>



<p>Now that you know what scalar components are, you will want to know
what you can do with them.

<p>They make it easy to calculate with vectors.  Take scalar
multiplication as a first example.
  
<p><b>Exercise</b>. Suppose you want to multiply the displacement
vector <img src="d.gif" align="bottom"> shown on the left by -2 or you
want to divide it by 2.  Do this by working in components, and give
the results in components.  Verify your results by drawing all vectors
involved (on a sheet of paper).

<p>Hint: Dividing a vector by 2 is the same as multiplying it by 1/2.

<p>When done, compare your answers to those on the next page.
