  <div class="title">Scalar Components of Vectors</div>



<p><b>Question</b>: Suppose a vector is given in terms of its
magnitude and direction. How would you calculate its scalar components
relative to a pair of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes?

<p>Calculate the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components of the vector <img
src="a.gif" align="bottom"> illustrated on the left.  Given are the
magnitude <i>a</i> = 5 and the angle <font face="symbol">q</font> =
127<sup>o</sup> between the vector and the positive x-axis.

<p>When done, go on to Page 6 to compare your answers and method of
calculation.
