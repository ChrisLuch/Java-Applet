  <div class="title">Scalar Components of Vectors</div>



<p>Drag vector <img src="a.gif" align="bottom">, by clicking on it
somewhere and dragging the mouse. You will not be able to change the
vector itself, i.e., its magnitude or direction.

<p>Observe how the vector's components behave.

<p>Observe that the components of the vector do <b>not</b> change when
the vector is being shifted around.  Neither does the vector change:
its magnitude and direction stay the same as well.

<p>Notice that in general, when the tail end of the vector is not at
the origin, the scalar components are equal to the differences of the
coordinates of the tip and tail ends of the vector.  

<p>Check this, with the vector in several different locations.
