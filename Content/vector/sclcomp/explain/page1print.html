<p><center><h4>Scalar Components of Vectors</h4>


<p>Suppose you want to find a single force <b>H</b> that can replace
the two forces <b>F</b> and <b>G</b> shown on the left.


<p>Newton stated in his Principia that <b>H</b> has to be the vector sum

                               <p><b>H</b>  = <b>F</b>  + <b>G</b>.

<p>If you want to calculate <b>H</b>, the easiest way to do this is to use
 scalar components. 


<p>The following pages will explain what scalar components are and how to
 use them.
