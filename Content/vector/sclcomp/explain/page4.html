<p>Now rotate the axes by clicking the tip of one of the axes and
dragging it. You will not be able to change the vector.

<p>Observe that the components change while the axes are being rotated,
but that the vector itself does not change.

<p>Therefore, in specifying a vector by its components, you must
specify the axes relative to which the components are taken. 

<p>Giving just the components is incomplete information.

<p>Try to adjust the axes so that the vector has the components
<i>a<sub>x</sub></i> = 4 and <i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = -6, or
<i>a<sub>x</sub></i> = 6.5 and <i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = 3.1 (or close to
it). Can you adjust the axes so that the coordinates have any values
whatsoever?
