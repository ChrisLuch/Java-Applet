         <h1>Vector Addition Practices</h1>

         <p><b>Preparation</b>: Vectors/Addition/Explain It/Tip-to-Tail and Vectors/Addition/Explain It/Parallelogram.</p>

         <p><b>Draw two vectors</b> in the drawing area. They will be
         labeled for you.  You can change the vectors as much as you like
         (by dragging their tips or tail ends).</p>

         <p>The simulation will let you practise adding these vectors by the
         tip-to-tail and the parallelogram methods.</p>
