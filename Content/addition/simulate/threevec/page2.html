   <p><b>Draw three vectors</b> in the drawing area.  They will be
   labeled for you.</p>

   <p>You can change your vectors as much as you like, by dragging
   them at their tips or tail ends.  You can also move a vector by
   dragging it at the middle.</p>

   <p>On the next page, these vectors will be unchangable.</p>
