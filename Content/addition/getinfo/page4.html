	    <p><b>Equivalence Of The Two Addition Methods</b></p>
    
       <p>The diagram at the bottom illustrates why the tip-to-tail
        method gives the same result as the parallelogram method. The
        reason is that the vectors that form the opposite sides of a
        parallelogram are equal.  It also illustrates that vector
        addition is commutative.</p>
     

      <p><b>Notation</b>

		  <p>The sum of the two vectors is labelled  <img src="a.gif"
        align="bottom">+<img src="b.gif" align="bottom">,
        not <i>a</i> + <i>b</i>. The latter would denote the sum of the
        <b>magnitudes</b> of the vectors, which is not the same as
        the sum of the vectors themselves.
		  
		  <p><b>Sum of Magnitudes vs. Magnitude of Sum</b>

        <p>The magnitudes of the two vectors are scalars and their sum
        is again a scalar, represented by the sum of the lengths of
        the blue and orange arrows. This sum, denoted |<img
        src="a.gif" align="bottom">| + |<img src="b.gif"
        align="bottom">| = <i>a</i> + <i>b</i>, is not to be confused
        with the magnitude of the sum of the two vectors, |<img
        src="a.gif" align="bottom">+<img src="b.gif" align="bottom">|,
        which is represented by the length of the green arrow.
