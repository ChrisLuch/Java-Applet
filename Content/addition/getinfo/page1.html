  <div class="title">Vector Addition</div>
        
   <p>There exist two graphical methods for obtaining the sum of two
   vectors:</p>

   <p class="indent">(a) the <b>tip-to-tail method</b> and </p>

   <p class="indent">(b) the <b>parallelogram method</b>. </p>
        
   <p>These will be explained on the following pages. </p>

	<p>For information on how to calculate the magnitude and direction
	of the sum of two vectors working with magnitudes and direction
	angles defining the two vectors, please see
	Vectors/Adddition/Explain It/Add'n Quantitative.

	<p>For information on how to calculate the sum of two vectors using
	scalar components, please see Vectors/Scalar Components/Explain It.
