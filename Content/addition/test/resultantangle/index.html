  <div class="title">Direction of the Sum of Two Displacements</div>


<p>

        A pine siskin makes two successive displacements.  His first
        displacement, <img src="../a.gif" align="bottom">, is 10 m at
        30<sup>o</sup> north of east.  This is followed by
        displacement <img src="../b.gif" align="bottom"> which is 12 m
        at 30<sup>o</sup> west of south. What is the direction of the
        siskin's total displacement?

<p align="center"><img src="siskin1.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Use scalar components</b> to calculate the angle between the siskin's
total displacement and the east direction, taken in the positive sense
(counter-clockwise or north of east).

<p>Type an angle between 0 and 360<sup>o</sup>.  E.g., a displacement
of 225<sup>o</sup> would be in a southwest direction.</p>
