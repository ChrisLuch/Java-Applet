<p>

   Yes, choice (c) is correct.  The diagram below shows how the sum
   can be constructed by joining the two vectors <img src="../a.gif"
   align="bottom"> and <img src="../b.gif" align="bottom"> tip to
   tail.  The tail end of vector <img src="../b.gif" align="bottom">
   is joined with the tip of vector <img src="../a.gif"
   align="bottom">. The sum is shown in green.

   <p align="center"><img src="correct3.gif"> </p>

   <p>The direction of the sum is from the free tail end to the free
   tip of the two vectors.

	<p>For better visibility, the vectors are not drawn on top of each
      other, but side-by-side.  So the tail of vector <img
      src="../b.gif" align="bottom"> is not actually joined with the
      tip of vector <img src="../a.gif" align="bottom"> in the
      diagram.  However, by moving the vectors sideways in your mind,
      you can imagine that this can be done in principle.

        <p>Suppose these vectors are displacements. Then the sum <img
        src="../a.gif" align="bottom"> + <img src="../b.gif"
        align="bottom"> is interpreted as the displacement that is
        equal to the two displacements <img src="../a.gif"
        align="bottom"> and <img src="../b.gif" align="bottom">
        carried out in succession.
