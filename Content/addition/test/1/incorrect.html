  <div class="normal"> <p>Choice (d) is not correct. It represents a
   vector that is in the opposite direction from the sum of the two
   given vectors.</p>

<p>On a sheet of paper, draw the vectors so that the tail of one
      vector is placed at the tip of the other vector.  Then draw the
      arrow from the free tail of one of the vectors to the free tip
      of the other vector. This will represent the sum of the two
      vectors. </p>
