  <p><font color="#000000" size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this experiment you investigate the motion of a steel ball that is rolled down a steel ramp 
and is allowed to bounce twice. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many different 
    things that can be investigated in this lab. Using the height from the ramp 
    to the floor you can determine the horizontal and vertical velocities before 
    and after the first collision. It is also possible to calculate the height 
    the ball reaches after its first collision, and compare it with the actual 
    value. Determine the kinetic energy both before and after the first collision. 
    Is the collision elastic or not? Calculate the total mechanical energy at 
    the point of release, the end of the ramp, and at the point of the first collision. 
    Is this energy conserved? The height from which the ball is dropped is 86cm. 
    Run the movie to observe the motion. Click on the link below to go to the 
    lab. </font> <font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will need the y versus t and the x versus t data. Paste the data into a spreadsheet to analyze the motion. 
You will not need to construct a graph for this lab. You will need the positions of both the collisions, and the height of the end of the ramp above the floor. 
Assume the horizontal velocity before the first collision is the same as the horizontal velocity just after the first collision.
