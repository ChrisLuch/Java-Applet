  <div class="title">Slingshot Effect</div>

  <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the motion of a space probe
  passing a planet.  The final speed of the space probe depends on the
  planet's speed.  The change in the speed of the probe as the probe
  passes the planet is called "gravitational assist" or "slingshot
  effect".  The applet demonstrates that the effect can be understood
  in terms of the Galilean transformation of velocity.</p>

  <p>Currently, no detailed information about the applet is available
  from the applet's Help menu.</p>
