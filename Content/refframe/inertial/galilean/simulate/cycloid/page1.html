<div class="title">Rolling Motion</div>

<p>The simulation on Page 2 shows the motion of a point fixed on a
rolling spool.  The motion of the point is the superposition of the
revolving and translating motions of the spool.  This kind of a motion
is called <i>cycloidal motion</i>.  The spool point's motion can be
understood in terms of the Galilean transformations of position and
velocity.</p>

<p>Detailed information on how the applet functions and a lesson with
exercises to be carried out with the applet are available under Applet
Help from the applet's Help menu.</p>
