    <div class="title">Galilean Transformation Applied to Planet Motion</div>

    <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the motion of a planet around the
    sun (or another fixed star), or the motion of a moon or satellite
    around a planet.</p>  

    <p>For detailed information on how to use the applet, go to Applet
    Help on the applet's Help menu and look at Help and ShowMe.  A
    Lesson accompanying the applet is available there as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Activities" under Related Items suggests investigations to be
      carried out with the applet on the Galilean velocity
      transformation relating different inertial reference frames.
