        <p><b>Question</b>.  What keeps an object moving with constant speed
        in a straight line?  Is some kind of an agent or force required to
        accomplish this?</p>

        <p>Experience seems to teach that the answer to this question is
        YES.  E.g., a car moving on a straight level highway with constant
        speed does require a working engine to maintain this speed.</p>  

        <p>The idea that a force is required to maintain the speed of an
        object moving in a straight line was held by the Greek philosopher
        Aristotle, 384 BC - 322 BC, and was widely accepted until the 16th
        century AD when the Italian physicist, astronomer, and mathematician
        Galileo Galilei, 1564 -1642, proposed a contrary point of view.</p>  

        <p>Galileo's point of view, as subsequently modified by Newton, has
        become the accepted view by physicists until the present time.
        However, this view is not 'natural' or 'intuitive' even today, because
        a view similar to Aristotle's is what is commonly held by people who
        have not studied Newtonian mechanics. To understand physics as it is
        practised today one needs to learn to take off the Aristotelean
        glasses and see things in a new perspective.</p>
