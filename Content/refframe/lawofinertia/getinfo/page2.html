  <p><b>Galileo's Law of Inertia</b></p>

  <blockquote>A body moving on a horizontal surface will keep on
  moving with constant speed as long as there are no forces acting on
  the body.</blockquote>

  <p>Galileo's view is opposite to Aristotle's.  Galileo says a force
  is needed to stop a motion while Aristotle says a force is needed to
  maintain it.</p>

  <p>Note that if the earth were a hard smooth sphere without friction
  and if there were no air resistance, a hard smooth ball would keep
  rolling on it forever with constant speed.  Galileo considered this
  motion to be force free.  He did not yet have the notion of
  gravitational force that was introduced later by Newton.  Thus, for
  Galileo, inertial motion was circular motion around a spherical
  earth. Newton's concept of inertial motion was different.  See Page
