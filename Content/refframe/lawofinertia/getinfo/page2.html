        <p><b>Galileo's Law of Inertia</b></p>

        <blockquote>A body moving on a horizontal surface will keep on
        moving with constant speed as long as there are no forces acting on
        the body.</blockquote>

        <p>Galileo's view is opposite to Aristotle's.  Galileo says a force
        is needed to stop a motion while Aristotle says a force is needed to
        maintain it.</p>

        <p>Note that if the earth were a hard smooth sphere without friction
        and if there were no air resistance, a hard smooth ball would keep
        rolling on it forever with constant speed.  Galileo considered this
        motion to be force free.  He did not yet have the notion of
        gravitational force that was introduced later by Newton.  Thus, for
        Galileo, inertial motion was circular motion around a spherical
        earth. Newton's concept of inertial motion was different.  See Page
