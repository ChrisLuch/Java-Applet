        <div class="title">Law of Inertia</div>

        <p><b>Questions</b>.  What is the physical origin of this inertia
        that keeps an object moving forever unless it is acted upon by a force?
        What is so special about motion in a straight line with constant
        speed?</p>

        <p>Newton thought of inertia as an intrinsic property of bodies, a
        property they would have no matter what surrounded them.  Newton
        also held a concept of absolute space, a space that existed
        independent of objects that might be placed within it. He conceived
        of the inertial motion of an object as relative to absolute space.</p>

        <p>The Austrian physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach, 1838 - 1916,
        the man after whom the concept of <i>mach number</i> is named, held
        a very different point of view.  For him, there was no such thing as
        absolute space.  Space was defined by the <b>relationship</b> between
        bodies, and the inertial properties of a body were caused by an
        interaction of this body with the totality of all fixed stars.  This would have
        to be an interaction different from the universal gravitational
        interaction.</p>

        <p>Attempts to build a consistent theory of inertia on such a new
        kind of interaction have not succeeded, so far.</p>
