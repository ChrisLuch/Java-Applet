  <div class="title">Distance Traveled and Distance</div>

<p>The example treated here is based on Exercise 5 from the Activities
under Related Items in the bottom left corner.  Have a look at this
Exercise before you continue.

<p>Exercise 5 deals with a ball that is being moved from a point A to
a point B along three successive straight-line path segments.  The
diagram below illustrates the situation.  It shows the path taken by
the ball in blue and the displacement vector <img src="d.gif"
align="bottom"> of the ball in green.  The scalar components
<i>d<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>d<sub>y</sub></i> of the displacement are
shown in green as well.

<p>The diagram is based on the applet on Page 2.  For instructions on
how to use the applet go to Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.

<p align="center"><img src="DistanceExplain.gif"></p>

<p>The <i>distance traveled</i> by the ball, <i>s</i>, is the length
of the blue path taken by the ball.  The value of <i>s</i> is obtained
as follows.

<p>The path consists of three straight-line segments:

<p><ul>

<li>5 m downward,</li>

<li>35 m to the left,</li>

<li>35 m upward.</li>

</ul>

<p>Thus,

<p align="center"><i>s</i> = 5 + 35 + 35 = 75 m.</p>

<p>The distance traveled by the ball must be distinguished from the
(straight-line) <i>distance</i> between the ball's initial and final
positions A and B.  The latter is equal to the magnitude <i>d</i> of
the ball's displacement <img src="d.gif" align="bottom">.  What is the
value of <i>d</i> in this case?

  <p>The components <i>d<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>d<sub>y</sub></i> of
  <img src="d.gif" align="bottom"> and the vector <img src="d.gif"
  align="bottom"> form a right-angle triangle, with <img src="d.gif"
  align="bottom"> as the hypotenuse.  Therefore, the magnitude
  <i>d</i> of <img src="d.gif" align="bottom"> is given by the
  Pythagorean theorem,

<p><center><i>d</i> = (<i>d<sub>x</sub></i><sup>2</sup> +
<i>d<sub>y</sub></i><sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup></center>

  <br>whence

  <br><center><i>d</i> = [(-35)<sup>2</sup> +
  25<sup>2</sup>]<sup>1/2</sup> = 43.0 m .</center>

<p>Note that <i>d</i> < <i>s</i>.  The straight-line distance between
two points is the shortest connection between the points.
