	<p> The applet on Page 5 will draw graphs of all four trigonometric
   functions.  Help on how to use the applet is available under Help
   on the applet's menu bar.

   <p>The Information on Pages 2 to 5 deals with four trigonometric
   functions: the sine, cosine, tangent, and cotangent functions.  It
   is pointed out on Pages 2 to 4 how to apply the trigonometric
   functions to calculations with scalar components of vectors.

   <p>All four trigonometric functions named above are defined for
   arguments ranging from minus to plus infinity.  (The tangent and
   cotangent functions are infinite at certain discrete points.)  For
   angles between 0 and 90<sup>o</sup>, or 0 to <font
   face="symbol">p/2</font> rad, the four functions can be defined by
   means of ratios of sides in a right-angle triangle.  To review
   these definitions, go to Basic Math/Trigonometry/Get
   Information/Definitions.  Here the more general definitions of
   these functions will be presented which are not restricted to
   angles between 0 and 90<sup>o</sup>.
