        <div class="title">(d) Constant Velocity Motion</div>

        <p>
        When you PLAY the motion, the red particle moves with constant speed
        in a straight line.  One also says that it moves with constant
        <i>velocity</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
        The particle is <b>not</b> interacting with anything.
        </p>

        <p>
        People did not always think of constant-velocity motions as
        interactionless.  They thought that some agent (force) was required
        to keep things moving, even with constant velocity.
        </p>


        <p>
        Observations from daily life support this kind of thinking. Wherever
        we see a motion with constant velocity it is maintained by some kind
        of an agent.  Think of cars.  Don't they require an engine to keep
        them moving with constant velocity?
        </p>

        <p>
        The Aristotelean view that an agent (interaction) is required to
        maintain a constant-velocity motion was generally accepted for almost
        2000 years until the sixteenth century AD when it was challenged by
        Galileo.  Galileo proposed a law of inertia that stated a contrary
        view: an object rolling on a perfectly smooth earth would keep on
        rolling forever, unless acted upon by some agent.
