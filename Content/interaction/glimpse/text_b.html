<div class="title">(b) Projectile Motion</div>

<p>
 The green bar at the bottom of the applet window is supposed to
 represent the surface of the earth.  When you PLAY the motion, the
 red particle performs a parabolic motion.
</p>

<p>
 This kind of motion is called <i>projectile motion</i>.  If you throw
 a ball into the air, it will perform approximately the kind of motion
 simulated here.  (Not exactly, because a real ball experiences air
 resistance while the red particle in the applet does not.)
</p>

<p>
 In the applet, the red particle is <b>interacting gravitationally</b>
 with the entire earth.  If the earth were not there, the red
 particle's motion would be quite different.
