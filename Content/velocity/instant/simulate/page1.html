    <p><b>Preparation</b>: Velocity/Basic Facts/Explain It.

    <p>An applet that lets you create an arbitray motion by controlling
    the velocity of a car or particle is on Page 2.  The purpose
    of the simulation is to demonstrate the relationship between the car's
    position and velocity.</p>

    <p>Details on how to use the applet will become available under Applet
    Help on the applet's Help menu.  Currently, no Help is available.</p>
