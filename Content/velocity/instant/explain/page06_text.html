  <div class="title">Instantaneous Velocity</div>

<p><b>Velocity Vs. Speed</b></p>

<blockquote>

At any given instant, the speed of an object is equal to the magnitude
of the object's velocity.

</blockquote>

<p>The speed of an object is defined as the time-rate-of-change of the
distance traveled by the object.  It turns out that this is equal to
the magnitude of the velocity.  Can you explain why this is true?</p>

<p><b>The answer is not obvious</b>, because the <b>average</b> speed
over some finite time interval is in general <b>not</b> equal to the
magnitude of the average velocity. See Velocity/Average/Explain It for
a simulation and discussion of that fact.  Then why is it that when
dealing with <b>instantaneous</b> quantities the speed <b>is</b> equal
to the magnitude of the velocity?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>The simulation on this page will illustrate the idea underlying the
answer.  Click the PLAY or STEP buttons of the applet.  The car will
move in a circle.  The simulation will show the car's displacement
vectors during successive 0.04-s time intervals in green.</p>

<p>Each one of these displacement vectors is a chord to the circular
path, connecting the end points of the corresponding arc element of
the path. Since each displacement is small, each is indistinguishable
graphically from the corresponding arc and its magnitude very close to
the length of that arc.  Dividing the magnitude of one of these
displacements or the length of the corresponding arc by the time
interval <i>dt</i> = 0.04 s gives the magnitude of the average
velocity or the average speed, respectively, during this time
interval.  Thus, the latter quantities are almost equal as well.  In
the limit as the time interval goes to zero they become exactly
equal.</p>
