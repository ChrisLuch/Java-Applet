<p>The calculated position of the car at the end of the second step is

<p align="center">(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>2</sub> = (1.64, 4.86)

<p>This calculated value is approximate only.  It is based on values
for the car's position and velocity after the first step.  If you
don't have these values, click REPLAY and then click the STEP button
once.  You should find the values</p>

 \textsf{The calculation of $(x,y)_{2}$ is as follows. The definition
of average velocity gives for the average velocity during the second
step the expression

\par

\[\mathbf{\vec{v}}\(_{av}\) = \frac{(x,y)\(_{2}\) - (x,y)\(_{1}\)}{0.04}.\]

\par

It implies for the position $(x,y)_{2}$ the expression

\par

\[(x,y)\(_{2}\) = (x,y)\(_{1}\) + \mathbf{\vec{v}}\(_{av}\) \times 0.04 .\]

\par

This is an exact expression.  However, we cannot use it to calculate
$(x,y)_{2}$ because we don't have a value for $\mathbf{\vec{v}}_{av}$.
We do have a value for $\mathbf{\vec{v}}_{1}$ and will use it instead
of $\mathbf{\vec{v}}_{av}$ to obtain an approximate value for
$(x,y)_{2}$.  This is the best we can do.  Thus, approximately,

 \par

\hspace{7 mm}$(x,y)\(_{2}\) = (x,y)\(_{1}\) +
 (v\(_{x}\),v\(_{y}\))\(_{1}\) \times \Delta t$ 

 \par

 \small $= (2.36, 4.48) + (-17.9,9.44)\times 0.04$
 \normalsize
 \par

 $= (1.64, 4.86)$ m.

 This approximate value is quite close to the correct value printed
 out by the applet.  It would be even closer had the time interval
 been shorter.

 \par

 The calculations on the last two pages have been based on the concept
 of velocity as a ratio of a small displacement and the corresponding
 time elapsed (mathematically: the limit of such ratios).  On the next
 two pages a slightly different concept of velocity will be discussed,
 namely, velocity as the time-rate-of-change of the position vector.
