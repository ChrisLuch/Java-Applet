<p><b>Useful Observation About Velocity</b></p>

<blockquote>

The velocity of an object points in the direction in which the tip of
the object's position vector is moving.

</blockquote>

<p>Use the simulation to observe this as follows. Uncheck everything
except 'Velocity Vector' and 'Position Vector'.  Produce a motion with
the velocity dial.  Then click RESTART and rerun the motion in
continuous mode by clicking PLAY or by stepping through it using the
STEP button.  As you watch the motion, think about the statement
above.</p>

<p>Display the car's path by checking 'Path' and <b>observe</b>
that the velocity vector points in the direction of the tangent to the
path at any given instant.  This is the direction in which the tip of
the position vector is moving at that instant.</p>

<p>You may want to view the motion in the car's frame by checking
'Car's Frame'.  </p>
