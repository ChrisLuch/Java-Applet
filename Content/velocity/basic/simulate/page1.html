    <p><b>Preparation</b>: Velocity/Basic Facts/Explain It.

    <p>The applet is on Page 2.  Instructions on how to use it will become
    available under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.  Currently, no
    Help is available.</p>

    <p>The applet lets you control the motion of a car by means of a
    velocity dial, i.e., by controlling the car's velocity.  The purpose
    of the simulation is to demonstrate the relationship between the car's
    position and velocity.
