  <div class="title">Velocity</div>

  <p><b>Click</b> somewhere inside the velocity dial in the control
  panel of the applet and hold the mouse button down.  A velocity
  vector will be drawn from the center of the dial to the point where
  you clicked, and the car will move with that velocity. If you keep
  the mouse button depressed and drag with the mouse, the velocity
  will change.</p>


  <p><b>Observe</b> that the velocity vector, shown in magenta color,
  is always in the direction of motion of the car.</p>

  <p>When you release the mouse button, the car's motion will be
  frozen.  If you click in the velocity dial again, the car's motion
  will resume and you can continue to control the car as before.</p>

  <p>If the car moves out of sight, you can get it back into view by
  clicking anywhere in the applet area and dragging the screen with
  the mouse.  You can also check 'Velocity Space'.  That will let you
  view things in the space in which the tail end of the velocity
  vector is fixed.  Since this tail end is at the car's center, the
  car's center is now fixed as well, in the center of the screen.  You
  will see the position space background moving relative to the
  car.</p>

  <p>If you click REPLAY and then PLAY, the previous motion will be
  replayed, and you can view it from either position space or velocity
  space, with or without the car, and with or without several other
  options.  Please consult the applet information on the pull-down
  menu under the MAP logo in the top left corner of the applet.</p>
