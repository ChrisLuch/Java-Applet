  <p><b>Second Lesson To Be Learned</b></p>

  <blockquote>

  <p>The direction of the velocity vector is the direction in which
  the tip of the position vector is moving.</p>

  <p>The magnitude of the velocity vector is the speed with which the
  tip of the position vector is moving.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>RESET the applet if necessary, and select the Position Vector
  check box.  This will draw a position vector from some 'origin'
  fixed in position space to the car.  Also select the Pos Path check
  box to display the car's path.  Then move the car with varying speed
  along some curved path.  Stop the motion, click REPLAY, and unselect
  the Car check box.  Then click the PLAY button.</p>

  <p><b>Observe</b> the features pointed out above.</p>

  <p>Click REPLAY again, drag the origin of the position vector to
  another point, and again click PLAY.  (To drag the origin of the
  position vector, check 'Grid' and then drag any point in the applet
  window while holding the Control button depressed.  Then uncheck
  'Grid' if you like.)</p>

  <p><b>Observe</b> that although the position vector now is a different
  vector it is still true that its tip is moving in the direction
  of the car's velocity at a rate equal to the car's speed.</p>

  <p>When defining velocity rigorously one defines it as the
  <i>time-rate-of-change of position</i>.  The lesson above
  illustrates this definition.  This definition of velocity is
  examined under Velocity/Instantaneous/Explain It.</p>
