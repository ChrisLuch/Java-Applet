  <p align="center">The magenta arrow represents the car's velocity</p>

  <p>Velocity is a vector quantity, i.e., it has magnitude and
  direction.  A car's velocity might be '80 km/h going north'.  80
  km/h is the <b>magnitude</b> of the car's velocity, also called
  <i>speed</i>.  Going north describes the <b>direction</b> of the
  car's velocity.  Both of these pieces of information are necessary
  to specify the car's velocity.  If one only says that the car is
  going at 80 km/h, one is specifying the car's speed, not its
  velocity.</p>

  <p>By the way, professional physicists often don't choose their
  words carefully and say 'velocity' when they really mean 'speed'.
  Here we will carefully distinguish between the two concepts, and you
  should do so too while still learning about vectors.</p>


  <p>On Page 2, a simulation will let you observe how the velocity of a
 car relates to the car's motion.  You will be able to control the car
 by controlling its velocity.</p>
