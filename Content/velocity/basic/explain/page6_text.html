  <p><b>Final Remarks</b></p>

        <p>Since velocity is a vector quantity, it is denoted by a
        vector symbol, often <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
        align="bottom">.  The magnitude of the velocity, called
        <i>speed</i>, is a scalar denoted by the same letter as
        velocity but without an arrow, i.e., by <i>v</i>.  The SI-unit
        of velocity is m/s.

		  <p>The concept of <i>average velocity</i> is
		  important also.  This is an average of the
		  (instantaneous) velocity over a finite time
		  interval.  It is a vector denoted <img src="v.gif"
		  alt="vector v" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub>.

	<p>This session has presented an intuitive, qualitative
	understanding of velocity.  Next you need to study the quantitative
	definition of velocity, already mentioned at the bottom of Page 5.
	For this, it is helpful to learn about average velocity first.
	Thus, it is recommended that you go to Velocity/Average Velocity
	next, and then to Velocity/Instantaneous Velocity.</p>

	<p>If you want to experiment more with the simulation used in this
	session, you may want to go to Velocity/Basic Facts/Simulate It.
