    The explanations of average velocity on the following pages use the
    applet on the left.  For instructions on how to use the applet see
    Help and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.  An
    additional Lesson on average velocity is available under Applet Help.

    You may want to experiment a bit with the applet before going on to
    Page 2.

    <b>Exercise</b>. Drag the ball, observe the ball's displacement, and
