<p><b>Things to Understand about Average Velocity</b>.

<p>1.  Average velocity is not the same as average speed.  

<ul>

<li>Average velocity has direction, average speed does not.</li>

<li>The <b>magnitude</b> of the average velocity, which <b>is</b> a
scalar, is <b>not</b> equal to the average speed in general.</li>

</ul>

<p>Now do the following. Taking a value for the average velocity from the
simulation, calculate its magnitude from the components
<i>v<sub>x,av</sub></i> and <i>v<sub>y,av</sub></i> using the
Pythagorean formula,

<p>

 |<b>v</b><sub>av</sub>| = square root of
 "(v<sub>x,av</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (v<sub>x,av</sub>)<sup>2</sup>".

<p>Compare this magnitude to the average speed, <i>v<sub>av</sub></i>.
Is it equal to, less than or greater than the average speed?  Can you
explain the numbers you observe?</p>

<p>Since the magnitude of the average velocity is in general different
from the average speed, we use different symbols for the two
quantities.  The notation <i>v<sub>av</sub></i> is used only for
average speed while a more elaborate notation is used for the
magnitude of the average velocity, as in the equation above.</p>
