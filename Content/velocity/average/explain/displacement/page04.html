    <p><b>Things to Understand about Average Velocity</b>.

    <p>2.  The average velocity during a given time interval is in general
    <b>not</b> equal to the <b>arithmetic mean</b> of the initial and
    final velocities.

    <p><b>Exercise</b>. Display the Data boxes by pressing the Data
    button.

    <p>Set the ball's initial position, and release the mouse button.
    Click on the ball again, and continue to hold down the mouse button
    without dragging the ball. Observe that time is elapsing while the
    ball's velocity is clearly zero.  Then drag the ball to a new
    position, still not releasing the mouse button. More time is elapsing
    while the ball is again at rest and its velocity zero once more.
    Release the mouse button.

    <p>Observe that the applet shows the average velocity to be
    <b>unequal</b> to zero (unless your displacement happens to be zero)
    while the <b>mean</b> of the initial and final velocities, which are
    both zero, clearly <b>is</b> zero. The non-zero value is correct
    because it results from the definition of average velocity on Page 2
    with a non-zero displacement.  Average velocity is <b>not</b> defined
    as the arithmetic mean of the initial and final velocity..</p>

    <p>You may want to review the analogous situation for average speed
    under Speed/Average/Explain It.  There you will find more information
    about the kind of average involved in both average speed and average
    velocity.</p>
