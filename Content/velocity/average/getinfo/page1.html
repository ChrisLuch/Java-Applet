  <div class="title">Average Velocity</div>

  <p>The average velocity of a mass point during a given time interval
  is defined as the ratio of the masspoint's displacement and the time
  elapsed during the time interval.

  <p><b>Definition of average velocity in symbols</b>:

    <img src="AvVelSymbDefn.gif" alt="Definition of Average Velocity">
  </p>

  <p>In this definition, &Delta;<img src="r.gif" alt="vector r"
  align="bottom"> denotes the change in the position vector, i.e., the
  displacement, of the mass point during the given time interval of
  duration &Delta;<i>t</i>.

  <p>Average velocity is a vector quantity because it is the ratio of
  a vector and a scalar.  The direction of the average velocity vector
  is that of the displacement vector &Delta;<img src="r.gif"
  alt="vector r" align="bottom">.

  <p>The SI-unit of average velocity is m/s.
 
  <p><b>Note</b>.  The magnitude of the average velocity is denoted
  |<img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub>|,
  <b>not</b> <i>v<sub>av</sub></i>.  The latter symbol denotes the
  <i>average speed</i>, which is defined as the ratio
  <i>s</i>/&Delta;<i>t</i> of distance <i>s</i> traveled and time
  elapsed and is in general not equal to the magnitude of the average
  velocity which is equal to |&Delta;<img src="r.gif" alt="vector r"
  align="bottom">|/&Delta;<i>t</i>.  The reason is that distance
  traveled is measured along the path actually traveled by the
  masspoint while the magnitude of the displacement is equal to the
  straight-line distance between the positions of the masspoint at the
  beginning and end of the given time interval.  See the illustration
  below.

    The initial and final positions of a red ball are indicated by the
    blue position vectors <nobr><img src="r.gif" alt="vector r"
    align="bottom"><sub>i</sub></nobr> and <nobr><img src="r.gif"
    alt="vector r" align="bottom"><sub>f</sub></nobr>, respectively.
    The magnitude of the ball's displacement |&Delta;<img src="r.gif"
    alt="vector r" align="bottom">| is equal to the magnitude of the
    pale green displacement vector while the distance <i>s</i>
    traveled by the ball is measured along the curved blue path taken
    by the ball in going from the initial to the final position.
