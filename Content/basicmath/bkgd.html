<h3> <Center>Preparation for Introductory Courses in Physics and
Astronomy</Center></h3>

<h3> <Center>Physics 211, Astronomy 211</Center></h3>


<p>From May to August, 1996 and 1997, a question was published here
every Friday.  Its solution was published the following Friday. These
questions and their solutions are available from the <a
href="#arc">Question Archive</a> below.</p>

<p>The questions can help you with your mathematical preparation for
first-year Physics and Astronomy courses at the University of Calgary
(with the exception of Astronomy 205 which has lower mathematics
requirements.)</p>

<p>However, physics is not mathematics, and having these mathematical
exercises does not prove that physics is some form of applied
mathematics.  The exercises are useful because, as Galileo already
said some 400 years ago, mathematics is the language of physics.
Mathematics can make our ideas about the natural world precise, and
nature seems to go along with this "unreasonably successful" approach.
This is why physicists use mathematics and this is why you have to
speak this language in order to understand better what is being said
in your physics course.  However, please keep in mind that the focus
of physics is always on understanding the natural world, not on the
mathematics.</p>

 
<p>For help with the questions, start by consulting your high school
textbook(s).  The area from which a question is drawn is indicated
with each question.  Some of the questions are quite challenging and
may go somewhat beyond the difficulty level that you are used to
seeing.  These questions are indicated as "difficult".  If you want
additional information or if you have suggestions for this question
page, please contact <a href="mailto:hlaue@phas.ucalgary.ca">Hans
