<p>Each of the four triangles above contains a <b>right angle</b>.
The three sides are labelled a, b, and c in no particular order.  One
of the two angles that is not a right angle is labeled by the Greek
letter <font face="symbol">a</font> (read: alpha).  </p>

<p>The three most commonly used trigonometric functions are the sine,
the cosine, and the tangent.  They are the trig functions that you
will find on all scientific pocket calculators.  They are sufficient
for establishing the relations requested below.</p>

<p><b>Task</b>.  Fill in all empty slots in the table below.  In each
slot, you are asked to place an expression for one of the sides in one
of the triangles (i) - (iv) in terms of one of the other sides and an
appropriate trig function evaluated for <font face="symbol">a</font>.

<p><b>Example</b>. In the first row of the table below, you are asked
to place expressions for side a in terms of side b and angle <font
face="symbol">a</font>.  The answers for triangles (i) and (ii) are
shown.  

<p>Fill in all empty slots in the table similarly.

<p>When done, compare your answers with those on Page 2.
