<center><h3> Answer to the July 5 Question</h3></center>

<p>When learning a new subject, it is excellent practice to vary a
question on the subject to which one already knows the answer.  </p>

<p>Try this technique by varying the last question, the June 28
question.  One variation is suggested below.  In addition, try to make
a variation of your own and work out the answer to your variation.  </p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  Suppose a parabolic mirror is oriented as in
the diagram below, i.e., turned 90 degrees relative to the orientation
of the mirror in the June 28 question.  You might ask yourself what
equation would now describe the shape of the mirror.  The answer is
given in the diagram.  Given this mirror, prove again that all rays
incident on the mirror parallel to the optical axis are reflected so
that they go through one and the same point on the optical axis, the
focal point, which is a distance 1/(4c) away from the vertex of the
mirror.  </p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The following calculation parallels that done in
the answer to the June 28 question.  It would be useful for you to
copy that solution on a piece of paper and compare each step to the
corresponding step in the solution below.</p>

<p>Since the parabola above is turned by 90 degrees relative to the
parabola in the June 28 question, and since otherwise nothing has
changed (the incident ray still has a distance b from the optical
axis), everything in the picture above including the direction of the
reflected ray must be turned by 90 degrees relative to the
corresponding elements in the diagram at the beginning of the Answer
to the June 28 Question.  This implies that the slope of the present
reflected ray must be the negative reciprocal of that of the reflected
ray in the June 28 case.  Using the letter r to denote these slopes,
with obvious subscripts to distinguish between the two cases, the two
slopes are given by </p>

<p>To find the y-coordinate of the point where the reflected ray
intersects the y-axis, we write down the equation of the straight line
of slope r that goes through the point where the incident ray hits the
mirror.  Then we set x = 0 in this equation and solve for y.  These
calculations are done below.  </p>

<p>Note that the equation of the straight line written down here is
the normal form of the equation, obtained by equating the ratio  
rise/run to the slope.  The run is equal to the change in
x-coordinate as one goes from the specific point x = b to the general
point x while the rise is equal to the change in the y-coordinate as one
goes from the y-value corresponding to x = b to the general point y.

<p>Again, the reflected ray intersects the optical axis at a distance f
= 1/(4c) from the vertex of the mirror.  </p>
