<h3> <Center>Answer to the August 23, 1996 Question</Center></h3>

<p>Physics 205, Physics 215, Astronomy 211 - Assume the moon is a
perfect sphere.  Somebody puts a rope tightly around the equator of
the moon so that no space is left between the rope and the moon's
surface.  Then he cuts the rope, inserts 1 m of rope between the two
ends of the cut rope, and redistributes the rope around the equator so
that it has an equal distance everywhere from the surface of the
moon.</b></p>

<p>The distance between the rope and the moon now is</p>

<p>(a) enough for a cat to squeeze through under the rope</p>
<p>(b) just barely enough for a mouse to squeeze through under the rope</p>
<p>(c) not nearly enough for a mouse to squeeze through</p>
<p>(d) impossible to say without knowing the moon's diameter.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  Choice (a) is the correct one.</p>

<p><b>Explanation</b>.  The distance between the rope and the moon,
after 1 m has been inserted, is independent of the radius of the moon.
We will now calculate this distance and see that the moon's radius
drops out of the calculation.</p>

<p>Let us define the following symbols:</p>

<p>R = radius of moon,    r = radius of rope (with 1 m inserted)</p>

<p>C = circumference of moon,   c = circumference of rope.</p>

<p>Doing the calculation in SI-units, we have c = C + 1.  Since the
radius of a circle is equal to the circumference divided by 2 pi, (pi
= 3.14...), we get</p>

<p>r = c/(2 pi) = (C + 1)/(2 pi) = C/(2 pi) + 1/(2 pi)</p>

<p>  = R + 1/6.28 m.</p>

<p>Thus, the rope is 1/6.28 m above the moon's surface.  This is
approximately 16 cm, easily enough space for a cat to squeeze
through.</p>
