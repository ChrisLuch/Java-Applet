<h4>August 1, 1997</h4>

<p>Physics 211 - In the July 18 and 25, 1997 questions you were asked
to start from a displacement vs. time graph and find the corresponding
velocity vs. time graph.  Today you will be asked to do the
opposite.  <b>(Graphs.)</b></p>

<p>Consider once more the four velocity vs. time graphs shown below.<p>

<p>For each of the four cases (a) to (d), draw (i) the corresponding
displacement vs. time graph that has <font face="symbol">D</font>x = 0
at t = 0, (i) a position vs. time graph that has x = 10 m at t = 0, and
(iii) a position vs. time graph that has x = -10 m at t = 0.</p>

<p>Hint: Review the answer to the July 25, 1997 question.</p>

<h4>August 8, 1997</h4>

<p>Physics 211 - For the following two graphs of position x vs. time
t, determine the values of the velocity at t = 2 s and t = 4
s. <b>(Graphs.)</b></p>

<p>For graph (a), it should be possible to come up with a fairly
accurate value of the velocity v.  However, for graph (b), one can
determine only a pretty rough value.  In case (b), it may help if you
hold a ruler against the screen.</p>

<p>Hint: Remember that the velocity at a time t is equal to the slope
of the position vs. time graph at that time t.  The slope of a graph
at a given point is equal to the slope of the tangent to the graph at
that point.  In the case of a straight-line graph, the tangent is
identical with the straight line.  In the case of a curved graph, the
tangent at a point is the straight line that touches the graph at that
point, but does not intersect it.</p>

<h4>August 15, 1997</h4>

<p>Physics 211 - Suppose that a particle moves with constant velocity
v = -15 m/s along an x-axis and that it passes the point x = 20 m at t
= - 1 s.  Where will the particle be at t = 3 s?  Solve this problem
both analytically, i.e., by calculation, and graphically.</p>

<p> Also derive an expression for the general position x of the
particle at the general time t.  In addition, make a diagram that
shows the x-axis and the particle's positions on the x-axis at t = -1
s and t = 3 s. <b>(Definition of velocity. Analytical geometry.
