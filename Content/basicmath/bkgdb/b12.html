<h3> <Center>Answer to the July 18, 1997 Question</Center></h3>


<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>Physics 211 - The questions this week and the next few weeks will
deal with the concepts of velocity and speed and their relationships
to position, displacement, and distance travelled. <b>(Graphs.)</b></p>

<p><u>Velocity</u>.  For an object moving along an x-axis, the
object's velocity v at a given instant can be defined as the slope of
the object's position vs. time graph at that instant.</p>

<p>To find the slope of a position vs. time graph at a given point,
draw the tangent to the graph at that point and take the slope of that
tangent.  The tangent to a curve at a point is the (unique) straight
line that touches the curve at that point, but does not intersect
it.</p>

<p>The velocity at a given instant can be either positive or negative
or zero, depending on whether the x vs. t graph is rising, horizontal,
or falling at that instant.</p>

<p><u>Speed</u>.  The speed of an object at a given instant is equal
to the magnitude (absolute value) of the velocity.  Thus, if the
velocity is 20 m/s, the speed is also 20 m/s.  If the velocity is -20
m/s, the speed is still 20 m/s.  Thus velocity and speed are not
always the same, and one must distinguish between the two
concepts.</p>

<p><u>Question</u>.  Draw velocity vs. time graphs for all four
displacement vs. time graphs shown below.  (These are the same graphs
as in the July 11, 1997 question.)  You may assume the position x at
time t to be zero so that the position x at time t is equal to the
displacement <font face="symbol">D</font>x at time t as shown in the
graphs.</p>

<p>You can draw the v vs. t graphs only qualitatively since no units
are indicated on the axes.  However, the graphs should be
qualitatively correct.  For example, if the position vs. time graph
has a slope that is decreasing (as t is increasing), the corresponding
v-values on the v vs. t graph should be decreasing as well.</p>

<p>Discuss what kind of a motion a hiker would have to perform if
she walked as graph (d) suggests.  Is this a realistic motion for a
hiker?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>The four velocity vs. time graphs are shown below.</p>

<p>The explanation of why these are the correct graphs will not be
provided today.  Try to come up with your own explanation.  The
explanation will be provided next week.</p>

<p>A hiker who moves according to graph (d) would start out with a
positive velocity while walking in the positive x-direction away from the
camp.  She would gradually slow down and come to a stop momentarily at
the point farthest from the camp.  Here she would turn around and then
walk back towards the camp (now moving in the negative x-direction),
gradually increasing her speed, until she is fastest upon returning to
the camp.  An unsual way of walking!</p>
