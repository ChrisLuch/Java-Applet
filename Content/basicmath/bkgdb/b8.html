<h3> <Center>Answer to the June 20, 1997 Question</Center></h3>


<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>Please refer back to the June 13, 1997 Question.  It is available
in the Question Archive.  <b>(Analytical Geometry.  Graphs.)</b></p>

<p>Draw graphs of (a) position x vs. time t, (b) the corresponding
displacement <font face="symbol">D></font>x vs. time t, and (c) the
corresponding distance s travelled vs. time t for motions from
P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub> and back to P<sub>1</sub> and for
motions from P<sub>2</sub> to P<sub>1</sub> and back to P<sub>2</sub>.
Do this for an x-axis pointing to the right as in the diagram above
and for an x-axis pointing in the opposite direction.  That is a total
of 12 graphs.</p>

<p>Take x<sub>1</sub> = -10 m and x<sub>2</sub> = 4 m when the x-axis
points to the right and x<sub>1</sub> = 10 m and x<sub>2</sub> = -4 m
when the x-axis points to the left.</p>

<p><b>Answers</b></p>

<p><b>x-axis pointing to the right, motion from P<sub>1</sub> to
P<sub>2</sub> to P<sub>1</sub> (first right, then left)</b></p>

<p>The three graphs of x vs. t, <font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t,
and s vs. t are shown below.  The time at the start of the motion has
been chosen as t = 0.</p>

<p>The first graph shows x vs. t. Note that the particle is not at
rest when it is at x = -10 m at t = 0, as indicated by the non-zero
slope of the graph at this point.  However, the particle gradually
slows down to a stop before turning around at x = 4 m, as indicated by
the rounded curve at this point.  After this point, the graph returns
to x = -10 m.</p>

<p>The <font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t graph is identical in shape
to the x vs. t graph, but shifted upward because the <font
face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t graph must start with <font
face="symbol">D</font>x = 0 at t = 0.</p>

<p>Similarly, the s vs. t graph must start with s = 0 at t = 0.
However, a distance travelled can never decrease.  Thus, the s vs. t
graph keeps on increasing after passing the point at which the
particle turns around.</p>

<p>The following three graphs describe this case.</p>

<p>If the motion is of the same type as before, except with a
different starting point and in the opposite direction, the x vs. t
graph now starts at x = 4 m, drops to x = -10 m, and rises again to x
= 4 m.</p>

<p>The displacement vs. time graph is again just the position vs. time
graph but shifted upward so that the displacement starts at 0 at t =
0.  The distance travelled vs. time graph is exactly the same as
before.  Distance travelled keeps on increasing whether the motion is
to the right or to the left.</p>

<p>The following three graphs describe this case.</p>

<p>The x vs. t graph differs from the previous x vs. t graph only in
so far as now the motion is from 10 m to -4 m to 10 m, rather than
from 4 m to -10 m to 4 m. Thus, the graph is merely shifted upward by
6 m.</p>

<p> The displacement and distance travelled graphs are identical to
the previous case.</p>

<p><b>x-axis pointing to the left, motion from P<sub>2</sub> to

<p>The x vs. t graph is very similar to the x vs. t graph in the first
case, but now x goes from -4 m to 10 m to -4 m, rather than from -10 m
to 4 m to -10 m.  Thus, the graph is merely shifted upward by 6 m.</p>

<p>The displacement and distanced travelled vs. time graphs are
identical to those in the first case.</p>
