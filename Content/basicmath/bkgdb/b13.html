<h3> <Center>Answer to the July 25, 1997 Question</Center></h3>


<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>Physics 211 - The July 18, 1997 question asked you to consider the
following four displacement vs. time graphs.</p>

<p>The corresponding velocity vs. time graphs are shown below.<p>

<p>Explain why these velocity vs. time graphs are consistent with the
displacement vs. time graphs.

<p>Hint: For a definition of velocity, see the July 18, 1997 question.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>Let us try to understand graph (a).  The velocity at a given
instant is equal to the slope of the position vs. time graph at that
instant.  Here we are given the displacement vs. time graph, not the
position vs. time graph.  So how is that related to the position
vs. time graph?</p>

<p>The displacement <font face="symbol">D</font>x = x - x<sub>r</sub>
at time t differs from the position x at time t only by the position
x<sub>r</sub> at some reference time t<sub>r</sub>.  The reference
position x<sub>r</sub> is the position from which we want to measure
the displacement.  When the object is at x = x<sub>r</sub>, e.g., at t
= t<sub>r</sub>, the object's displacement is <font
face="symbol">D</font>x = x - x<sub>r</sub> = x<sub>r</sub> -
x<sub>r</sub> = 0.  In each of the following diagrams (a) to (d), one
time t<sub>r</sub> has been indicated at which the displacement is
zero.</p>

<p> Suppose the position x = x<sub>r</sub> is equal to 10 m.  Then the
displacement at a general time t is equal to <font
face="symbol">D</font>x = x - 10 so that x = <font
face="symbol">D</font>x + 10.  The followig four diagrams show x vs. t
corresponding to the graphs of <font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t
above assuming x<sub>r</sub> = 10 m in all four cases.

<p>Notice that the graphs of x vs. t have the same shapes as those of
<font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t, but that they are translated
vertically upward relative to the <font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t
graphs by 10 m.  Thus, at a given instant t, the two kinds of graph
have the same slope.</p>

<p>Thus, the velocity v at a given instant is equal to the slope of
the <font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t graph at that instant.  In the
case of graph (a), the slope of the <font face="symbol">D</font>x
vs. t graph is constant and negative at all times.  Thus, at all
times, v has the same constant and negative value equal to this slope.
Therefore, the v vs. t graph in case (a) is a horizontal line below the
t-axis.</p>

<p>Similarly, in case (c), the slope of the <font
face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t graph is constant and positive.  Thus,
the v vs. t graph is a horizontal line above the t-axis.</p>

<p>In case (b), the slope of the <font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t
graph is varying.  At t = 0 it is negative because <font
face="symbol">D</font>x is decreasing as one goes in the direction of
increasing t at this point.  Thus, the value of v at t = 0 should be
negative.  Then, as t increases, v should increase (become less
negative) because the slope of the <font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t
graph is becoming less negative all the time, until the slope and,
therefore, the velocity becomes zero at t = t<sub>r</sub>.  Beyond
that point, the slope of the <font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t graph
turns positive and continues to increase.  Likewise, v becomes
positive and continues to increase beyond this point.</p>

<p>The graph above of v vs. t in case (b) shows v to be increasing
linearly.  That the increase should be linear rather than something
else cannot be seen from the qualitative explanation above.  For that
one would have to actually measure the slope at different points along
the graph.  However, a linear increase of v with t is certainly a
possibility, given the way the <font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t
graph looks.</p>

<p>Finally, case (d) is similar to case (b).  Here, the slope of the
<font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t graph is positive at t = 0 and
then decreases as t increases.  The corresponding v vs. t graph
reflects these facts.
