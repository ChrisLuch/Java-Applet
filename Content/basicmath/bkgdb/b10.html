<h3> <Center>Answer to the July 4, 1997 Question</Center></h3>


<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>Physics 211 - This is a review question on the material covered in
the last three questions, starting with the June 13, 1997
question. <b>(Signs. Terminology.)</b></p>

<p>These questions dealt with the concepts of position, displacement,
and distance travelled.  They also dealt with signs and their
dependence on the choice of the direction of an axis.</p>

<p>The following two diagrams show two points and an x-axis.  The
positions of the two points are measured by their x-coordinates.  In
both diagrams, the origin x = 0 lies between the two points.  The
origin is not indicated.  The only difference between the two diagrams
is that in diagram (a) the x-axis points to the right while in diagram
(b) it points to the left.</p>

<p>Today's question refers to a motion from point P<sub>2</sub> to
point P<sub>1</sub>.  Which of the following quantities are positive,
which ones are negative: the position coordinates of the two points,
the displacement, and the distance travelled?  Indicate your answers
in the chart below by either a plus or a minus sign.  The two rows
refer to the choices of axes illustrated in diagrams (a) and (b). The
symbol s heading the last column denotes the distance travelled.  Two
entries in the table have already been made as examples.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>The two diagrams (a) and (b) are drawn below.  This time, however,
the origin of the x-axis is indicated and specific values for the
coordinates x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> have been assumed, to make
things more concrete.  Also the direction of the displacement from
P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub> has been indicated by a bold arrow.</p>

<p>The following table lists the correct signs.</p>

<p><b>Explanation</b>. The important thing to realize is that signs
depend on the choice of axis.  An x-axis can be chosen to point to the
right or to the left and the signs of certain quantities (not all
quantities) change accordingly.</p>

<p>It should be clear that the signs of the position coordinates
x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> get reversed when the direction of the
x-axis is reversed while the origin remains the same.</b>

<p>In case (a), the displacement is opposite to the direction of the
x-axis.  Therefore, the x-values decrease in the direction of the
displacement so that the displacement <font face="symbol">D</font>x =
x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub> is negative.  In the given example,
<font face="symbol">D</font>x = x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub> = -4 - 10
= -14 m.  The distance travelled is, by definition, always positive
(or zero).  In the given example, it is equal to 14 m.</p>

<p><p>In case (b), the displacement is in the same direction as the
x-axis.  Therefore, the x-values increase in the direction of the
displacement so that the displacement <font face="symbol">D</font>x =
x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub> is positive.  In the given example,
<font face="symbol">D</font>x = x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub> = 4 - (-10)
= 14 m.  The distance travelled is, by definition, always positive
(or zero).  It is again equal to 14 m.</p>
