<h4>June 6, 1997</h4>

<p>Physics 211 - This question is a continuation of the May 30
question.  Remember that in that question we had one car whose
position x at time t was given by x = -20t + 20.  Let us call this Car
A.  Suppose there is a second car, Car B, which is parked on the road
at x = 10 m. </p>

<p><b>(a)</b> At what time does Car A pass Car B?  Determine the
answer both graphically and analytically. <b>(Graphs. Analytical
Geometry.)</b></p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Show the graphs of the motions of Cars A and B in the
reference frame of Car A, i.e., on a pair of x',t axes where the
x'-axis is the position axis relative to which Car A is at rest.  As
in the May 30 question, Car A is at x' = 20 m.  Draw the x'-axis
vertical and the t-axis horizontal.</p>

<p>Is the intersection point of the x' vs. t graphs for the two cars
consistent with the answer in part (a)?<b>(Graphs. Analytical
Geometry.)</b></p>

<h4>Question of the Week - June 13, 1997</h4>

<p>Physics 211 - This question and the following ones until July 11,
1997 will deal with signs, notation, terminology, and graphs, all
related to position, displacement, and distance
travelled. <b>(Analytical Geometry.)</b></p>

<p>The following diagram shows two points, P<sub>1</sub> and
P<sub>2</sub>, on an x-axis.  The x-coordinates of the two points are
denoted x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub>, respectively.</p>

<p><u>Definitions</u>. Suppose an object moves from P<sub>1</sub> to
P<sub>2</sub>, then the <u>displacement</u> of the object is defined
as the change in position, i.e., as the difference x<sub>2</sub> -
x<sub>1</sub>.  This difference is also denoted <font
face="symbol">D</font>x = x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> (read: "delta
x").  This displacement must be distinguished from the <u>distance
travelled</u> by the object, which is equal to the distance between
the two points and which in turn is equal to the absolute value
|x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>|. </p>

<p>Note that a distance between two points and the distance travelled
by an object can never be negative, but that a displacement can be
negative.</p>

<p><u>Question</u>. In the diagram above, the direction of the x-axis
is to the right, i.e., the x-values are increasing as one goes to the
right. (This is indicated by having the x-label of the axis on the
right.) Suppose the points P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub> remain
unchanged, but that the direction of the x-axis is reversed.  What are
the signs of the displacement <font face="symbol">D</font>x =
x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> and of the distance travelled by the
object, |x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>| then?  I.e., indicate which
ones, if any, of these quantities are positive and which ones are
negative.</p>

<h4>Question of the Week - June 20, 1997</h4>

<p>Physics 211 - <p>Please refer back to the June 13, 1997 Question.
It is available in the Question Archive.  <b>(Analytical Geometry.
Graphs.)</b></p>

<center><img
src="http://www.phas.ucalgary.ca/~hlaue/bkgdb/images/b/b7G1.gif"></center>

<p>Draw graphs of (a) position x vs. time t, (b) the corresponding
displacement <font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. time t, and (c) the
corresponding distance s travelled vs. time t for motions from
P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub> and back to P<sub>1</sub> and for
motions from P<sub>2</sub> to P<sub>1</sub> and back to P<sub>2</sub>.
Do this for an x-axis pointing to the right as in the diagram above
and for an x-axis pointing in the opposite direction.  That is a total
of 12 graphs.</p>

<p>Take x<sub>1</sub> = -10 m and x<sub>2</sub> = 4 m when the x-axis
points to the right and x<sub>1</sub> = 10 m and x<sub>2</sub> = -4 m
when the x-axis points to the left.</p>

<h4>Question of the Week - June 27, 1997</h4>

<p>Physics 211 - Please refer back to the June 13, 1997 Question, in
particular the definitions of displacement and distance travelled, and
to the June 20, 1997 Question, which has examples of graphs.  These
questions are available in the Question Archive.  <b>(Analytical
Geometry.  Graphs.)</b></p>

<p>Suppose a hiker leaves his camp at time t = 0 in the morning and
returns to his camp two hours later.  Various hypothetical graphs of
distance travelled, s, vs. time elapsed, t, for the hike are shown
above.</p>

<p>Which graph (or graphs) could represent the distance travelled by
the hiker vs. time elapsed?  Give reasons, both for the possible and
the impossible graphs.</p>
