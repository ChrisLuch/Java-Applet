<h3> <Center>Answer to the July 11, 1997 Question</Center></h3>


<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>Physics 211 - This is one more question on the material covered in
the last four questions, starting with the June 13, 1997
question. This question is a variation of the June 27, 1997 question.
It deals with graphs of displacement vs. time rather than distance
travelled vs. time. <b>(Graphs.)</b></p>

<p>Suppose a hiker leaves her camp at time t = 0 in the morning and
returns to her camp two hours later.  Various hypothetical graphs of
her displacement from the camp, <font face="symbol">D</font>x,
vs. time elapsed, t, for the hike are shown above.  </p>

<p>Which graph (or graphs) could represent the displacement of the
hiker vs. time elapsed?  Give reasons, both for the possible and the
impossible graphs.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>Graph (d) is the only one that could represent the displacement of
the hiker vs. the time elapsed.  The four graphs will now be discussed
in alphabetical sequence.</p>

<p><u>Graph (a)</u>. Graph (a) shows a displacement <font
face="symbol">D</font>x that starts with a non-zero value.  This is
impossible because the displacement is necessarily zero at the start
of the motion, which is at t = 0.  The fact that the displacement
takes on negative values is not a problem.  This would happen if the
hiker were at a position whose x-value is less than the initial
x-value.</p>

<p><u>Graph (b)</u>. Graph (b) is impossible for the same reason as
graph (a).</p>

<p><u>Graph (c)</u>.  This graph is impossible because it ends up with
a non-zero value of the displacement <font face="symbol">D</font>x.
The displacement should be zero whenever the hiker is at the camp,
i.e., at the start and at the finish of the hike.</p>

<p><u>Graph (d)</u>.  This graph is possible because the displacement
<font face="symbol">D</font>x is zero both at the start and at the
finish.  In between, the displacement is positive at all times.  This
means the hiker is in one direction away from the camp during her hike
and does not pass the camp at any time during the hike.</p>

<p>However, graph (d) is a rather peculiar displacement vs. time graph
for a hiker.  This becomes apparent when one thinks about the hiker's
velocity during her hike.  The hiker's velocity will be the subject of
next week's question.</p>
