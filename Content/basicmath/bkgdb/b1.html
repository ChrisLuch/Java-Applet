<h3> <Center>Answer to the May 2, 1997 Question</Center></h3>

<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>A car is moving with constant velocity so that its position
coordinate x at time t is equal to x = at + b, where a and b are
constants.  Solve this equation for t. <b> (Algebra.)</b></p>


<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>The answer is t = x/a - b/a.  One can obtain this result as
follows.</p>

<p>A basic rule in algebra is that you can do anything to an equation
as long as you do the same thing to both sides of the equation (and,
of course, as long as you are carrying out a "legal" algebraic
operation).</p>

<p>Let us practise this principle step-by-step for the given equation.
Since we want to end up with an equation that has t on the left-hand
side and everything else on the right-hand side, we start by rewriting
the equation in the form</p>

<p><center>at + b = x.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1)</center></p>

<p>The principle used here is that A = B implies B = A, where A and B
can stand for any algebraic expressions.  Now t is on the left-hand
side, but it is not alone on the left-hand side.  We have to get rid
of the quantities a and b that appear on the left-hand side.  Which
one shall we gid rid of first, a or b?</p>

<p>It takes either a certain amount of "calculating ahead in your
head" or practice to know what is going to be easiest.  Here, getting
rid of b on the left-hand side looks easier than getting rid of a
because all we have to do to get rid of b is to subtract b from both
sides of the equation.  Subtracting b from the left-hand side, and
using the associative law of addition, transforms the left-hand side
as follows:</p>

<p><center>(at + b) - b = at + (b - b) =
at.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2)</center></p>

<p>Subtracting b from the right-hand side of equation (1) gives x - b.
Equating this to expression (2) gives</p>

<p><center>at  =  x - b.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(3)</center></p>

<p>All that is left to do is to get rid of a on the left-hand side.
To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by a.  The result,
using the distributive law of division, is</p>

<p><center>at/a = t = (x - b)/a = x/a -
b/a.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(4)</center></p>

<p>If we had tried to get rid of a first, by dividing both sides of
equation (1) by a, the second step would have involved subtracting b/a
and, of course, the final result would have been the same.  In this
case, the amount of work would have been very much the same.  It would
be a good exercise for you to rederive result (4) this way.
Sometimes, one has no choice in which step to take first.</p>
