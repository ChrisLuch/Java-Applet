<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>Physics 211 - (This is a challenge question.  It contains concepts
that you are not expected to have studied before beginning the
course.)  Let us consider once more the car from the May 16 question.
The position x of the car as a function of the time t could be
described by the equation x = -20t + 20.&nbsp<b>(Analytical
Geometry. Graphs.)</b></p>

<p>Suppose you have a reference frame, called the <u>car's frame</u>,
in which this car is at rest, i.e., a reference frame that is moving
at the car's velocity relative to the road.  The frame in which the
road is at rest is called the <u>road's frame</u>.  In the car's
frame, the car's position is constant.  Let x' denote the position
coordinate in the car's frame.  (x is the position coordinate in the
road's frame.)  Let us choose the origin of the car's frame, x' = 0,
so that the constant position of the car in this frame is equal to x'
= 20 m, at all times.</p>

<p>Hint: You can think of the car's frame as an (infinitely) long
ruler rigidly attached to the car, aligned with the direction in which
the car is moving, and moving with the car.  The ruler is used for
measuring the positions of objects.  Thus, to determine the value of
the position of an object in the car's frame at a given time, i.e.,
the object's x'-value at that time, one simply records where on the
ruler the object is at that time.  The car itself is at x' = 20 m on
this ruler.  The origin of the ruler is outside of the car.</p>

<p><b>Part (a)</b>.<spacer type="horizontal" size="3">Using the same set of
x,t axes as for the x vs. t graph of the motion of the car in the May
16 question, show the x vs. t graph of a second car that is at rest at
the origin of the car's frame, i.e., for which x' = 0 at all
times.</p>

<p><b>Answer to Part (a)</b></p>

<p>The equation x = -20t + 20 implies that in the road's frame the car
is at x = 20 m at time t = 0.  Since in its own frame the car is at x'
= 20 m at all times, including at t = 0, the primed and unprimed
position coordinates of the car are equal at t = 0.  This implies that
x' = x for all points at t = 0, not only for the point where the car
happens to be, because the distances between any two points at a given
instant are the same in both frames.</p>

<p>The x'-axis is moving relative to the x-axis with a velocity equal
to -20 m/s.  This means that the origin of the x'-axis is at x = -20t
at time t.  Therefore a point with x-coordinate x will have an
x'-coordinate x' = x + 20t at time t.  (Note that it is +20t, not
-20t, in this equation.  The reason for this will become clear if you
draw a picture of the two axes side-by-side at some time t > 0 that
shows the two origins x = 0 and x' = 0 and shows a given point with
x-coordinate x.  Remember that this is a challenge question.  So there
are a few things left for you to figure out on your own.)</p>

<p>The equation</p>
<p><center>x' = x + 20t<spacer
type="horizontal" size="30">(1)</center></p>
<p>

<p>lets you calculate the x'-coordinate of a point at time t whose
x-coordinate at time t is known, and vice versa.</p>

<p>We are given that the second car has x' = 0 at all times.
Substituting this value into equation (1) gives us the equation</p>

<p><center>x = -20t<spacer type="horizontal" size="30">(2)</center></p>

<p>for the second car.  This is a straight line through the origin of
an x,t coordinate system.  This line is parallel to that for the first
car because both cars have the same velocity, namely, -20 m/s. (The
velocity is equal to the slope of an x vs. t graph.)  See the
following diagram.</p>

<p><b>Part (b)</b>.<spacer type="horizontal" size="3">Do the same as in part
(a), but for a car that is at rest at x' = 40 m.</p>

<p><b>Answer to Part (b)</b></p>

<p>Substituting x' = 40 m into equation (1) and solving for x gives</p>

<p><center>x = -20t + 40<spacer type="horizontal" size="30">(3)</center></p>

<p>The graph of this equation is a straight line parallel to the
straight line in the preceding two graphs, but intersecting the x-axis
at x = 40 m.  See the following diagram.</p>

<p><b>Part (c)</b>.<spacer type="horizontal" size="3">What are the distances
between the three cars (i) in the frame in which the road is at rest
and (ii) in the car's frame?</p>

<p><b>Answer to Part (c)</b></p>

<p>The three cars are spaced at distances of 20 m.  These spacings are
the same in both frames, because distances between points are the same
in the two frames, and the distances stay the same in time because all
three cars are moving with the same velocity.</p>
