<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>Physics 211 - This question is a continuation of the May 30
question.  Remember that in that question we had one car whose
position x at time t was given by x = -20t + 20.  Let us call this Car
A.  Suppose there is a second car, Car B, which is parked on the road
at x = 10 m. </p>

<p><b>(a)</b> At what time does Car A pass Car B?  Determine the
answer both graphically and analytically. <b>(Graphs. Analytical
Geometry.)</b></p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>At what time t do the x-values of the two cars coincide?  To find
this time, we equate the x-values of the two cars, i.e., we let x = 10
in x = -20t + 20.  Thus,</p>

<p><center>10 = -20t + 20.</center></p>

<p>First subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation and then
dividing by -20 isolates t:</p>

<p><center>10 - 20 = -10 = -20t &nbsp&nbsp:&nbsp&nbsp t = 0.5
s.</center></p>

<p>Thus Car A passes Car B at t = 0.5 s.  The following graph agrees
with this result.  Since Car B is at rest at x = 10 m, the graph of
its motion is a horizontal line at x = 10 m.  This line intersects the
graph of x = -20t + 20 at t = 0.5 s and x = 10 m.</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Show the graphs of the motions of Cars A and B in the
reference frame of Car A, i.e., on a pair of x',t axes where the
x'-axis is the position axis relative to which Car A is at rest.  As
in the May 30 question, Car A is at x' = 20 m.  Draw the x'-axis
vertical and the t-axis horizontal.</p>

<p>Is the intersection point of the x' vs. t graphs for the two cars
consistent with the answer in part (a)?<b>(Graphs. Analytical
Geometry.)</b></p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>We need to determine the equations that relate the x'-positions of
the two cars to the time t.  Then we can graph these equations on a
pair of x',t axes.</p>

<p>For Car A, the equation is simply x' = 20 m.  For Car B, we must
translate the equation x = 10 m into an equation relating x' to t.</p>

<p>In the answer to Part (a) of the March 30 question, it was shown
that the origin of the frame in which Car A is at rest, i.e., the
point x' = 0, moves in the road's frame according to the equation x =
-20t.</p>

<p>Thus, if at time t the point x' = 0 is at x = -20t, then the point
x = 10 has a displacement of 10 - (-20t) = 10 + 20t from the point x'
= 0.  Therefore the point x' = 0 has the x-coordinate x = 10 + 20t at
time t.  The following diagram illustrates this situation.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the graphs of the two equations x' = 20
and x' = 10 + 20t.</p>

<p>As you can see, the intersection point is again at t = 0.5 s.</p>
