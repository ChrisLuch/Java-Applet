<div class="title">Activities on Internal Energy</div>

 <p>
   The following Activities are for the 'Friction and Internal Energy'
   applet.  Make sure you know how the applet functions by consulting
   Help and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 1</b>.  The purpose of Activity 1 is to investigate
   what happens to the work done on the block by the applied force
   when the block is moving with constant speed and its kinetic energy
   is not changing.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  Set the following parameters
   and the following initial conditions at <i>t</i> = 0 for the block:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   mass: <i>m</i> = 5.0 kg
  </li>
  <li>
   initial position: <i>x</i>(0) = 0
  </li>
  <li>
   initial velocity: <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0) = 2.0 m/s
  </li>
  <li>
    magnitude of applied force: <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i> = 9.8 N
  </li>
  <li>
    direction of applied force: <font face="symbol">q</font> = 0<sup>o</sup>
  </li>
  <li>
    kinetic coefficient of friction: <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub> = 0.20
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
   Display the energy box.  With the settings above, it displays two
   columns of non-zero height, the kinetic energies <i>KE</i>(0) and
   <i>KE</i>.  Of course, at <i>t</i> = 0 the instantaneous kinetic
   energy <i>KE</i> is necessarily equal to the initial kinetic energy
   <i>KE</i>(0).  At the start, the work <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> done
   by the applied force and the change <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> in the internal energy of the
   block-table system are zero.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 2</b>. PLAY the motion, and observe the changes in the
   energy bars.  PAUSE the applet.  Then REWIND it, and observe again.
   In a sentence or two, write down what you observe and explain the
   change in the internal energy <i>U</i> of the block-table system in
   view of energy conservation.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 3</b>.  Display the data box when the motion is paused,
   and given the values of <i>t</i>, <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>, and
   <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i>, calculate the change <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> in the block's position and the work
   done on the block by the applied force.  From the latter, given
   that the block's kinetic energy is constant in this case, predict
   the change <font face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> in the internal
   energy of the block-table system.  Compare your answers to the
   values in the data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Question</b>.  Why is the work <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> done by
   the applied force on the block equal to the change in internal
   energy of the block-table system, and not equal to the change in
   internal energy of just the block?
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Answer</b>.  <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> is the total external work
   done on the block-table system and, by the law of energy
   conservation, must equal the change in the total energy of this
   system.  The system's energy consists of two parts: kinetic energy
   and internal energy.  The kinetic energy is constant in this case.
   Therefore, <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> must be equal to the change in
   the internal energy of this system.
 </p>
 <p>
   It is possible theoretically to consider just the block alone.
   However, then must add to <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> the work
   <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> done by the friction force acting on the
   block.  The sum is the total external work done on the block and,
   by energy conservation, must equal the change in the block's
   energy.  However, in practice, it is impossible to calculate
   <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i>.  To calculate this work one would need to
   know the tiny displacements of the surface irregularities at the
   bottom of the block during the block's motion and the individual
   forces acting on these.
 </p>
 <p>
   Note that <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> is <b>not</b> equal to
   -<i>W<sub>appl</sub></i>.  If that were the case, the block's
   internal energy would have to remain constant, which is clearly not
   true.  The block gets warmer which means that its internal energy
   must increase.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 2</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is to investigate
   what happens to the work done on the block by the friction force
   when there is no applied force acting on the block.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  Set the following parameters
   and the following initial conditions at <i>t</i> = 0 for the block:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   mass: <i>m</i> = 5.0 kg
  </li>
  <li>
   initial position: <i>x</i>(0) = 0
  </li>
  <li>
   initial velocity: <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0) = 2.0 m/s
  </li>
  <li>
    magnitude of applied force: <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i> = 0
  </li>
  <li>
    direction of applied force: <font face="symbol">q</font> = 0<sup>o</sup>
  </li>
  <li>
    kinetic coefficient of friction: <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub> = 0.20
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
   Display the energy box.  With the settings above, it displays two
   columns of non-zero height, the kinetic energies <i>KE</i>(0) and
   <i>KE</i>.  Of course, at <i>t</i> = 0 the instantaneous kinetic
   energy <i>KE</i> is necessarily equal to the initial kinetic energy
   <i>KE</i>(0).  At the start, the work <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> done
   by the applied force and the change <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> in the internal energy of the
   block-table system are zero.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 2</b>. PLAY the motion, and observe the changes in the
   energy bars until the block comes to a stop.  Then REWIND the
   applet, and observe again.  In a sentence or two, write down what
   you observe and explain the change in the internal energy <i>U</i>
   of the block-table system in view of energy conservation.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 3</b>.  From the settings of <i>m</i> and
   <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0), calculate the value <i>KE</i>(0) of the
   initial kinetic energy, and predict the change in the internal
   energy of the block-table system from the beginning of the motion
   until the motion comes to a stop.  Compare your results with the
   values listed in the data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 4</b>.  REWIND the applet, display the data box, and
   note down the value of the friction force.  Calculate this value
   from the settings for <i>m</i> and <font
   face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub>.
 </p>
 <p>
   PLAY the motion until the block comes to a stop.  Given the values
   of <i>t</i>, <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0), <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i> (during the
   motion, <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i> is unequal to 0), and <i>m</i>,
   calculate the block's displacement <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> until the block comes to a stop.
 </p>
 <p>
   Calculate the product <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i><font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i>.  This product <b>looks like</b> it
   is equal to the work <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> done by friction.
   However, it is <b>not</b> equal to <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> because
   <font face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> is not equal to the
   displacements of the small irregularites at the bottom of the block
   that momentarily lock with those at the surface of the table, bend,
   and brake contact while the block is moving.  We need to consider
   these latter displacments to calculate <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i>.
 </p>
   Nevertheless, equate the value of <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i><font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> with the sum of <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>K</i> and <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>U<sub>block</sub></i>,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
    <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i><font face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> =
   <font face="symbol">D</font><i>K</i> + <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>U<sub>block</sub></i> (INCORRECT).
 </p>
 <p>
   Since <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> = 0 in the present case, this
   equation should give us the change in the block's internal energy
   if <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i><font face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i>
   were indeed the friction work <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i>.  You should
   find <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i><font face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i>
   = -10.0 J.  Together with <font face="symbol">D</font><i>K</i> =
   -10.0 J, the preceding equation, if true, would imply <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>U<sub>block</sub></i> = 0.  This is
   clearly incorrect because <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>U<sub>block</sub></i> is greater than
   zero.  The block's internal energy increases as the block is
   sliding to a stop while getting warmer.
 </p>
 <p>
  The moral of this story is that we cannot calculate friction work by
  using the displacement of the center of mass of the block and that
  there is no practical way of calculating the change in the block's
  internal energy resulting from the presence of friction.  We only
  can calculate the change in the internal energy of the block-table
  system for which we do <b>not</b> need to calculate the work done by
  friction because this work does not amount to an <b>external</b>
  transfer of energy for the block-table system.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>Activity 3</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is repeat the kinds
  of observations and calculations from Activities 1 and 2 in a more
  general case where the velocity is not constant and the motion does
  not come to a stop.
 </p>
<p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  Set the following parameters
   and the following initial conditions at <i>t</i> = 0 for the block:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   mass: <i>m</i> = 5.0 kg
  </li>
  <li>
   initial position: <i>x</i>(0) = 0
  </li>
  <li>
   initial velocity: <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0) = -2.0 m/s
  </li>
  <li>
    magnitude of applied force: <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i> = 20.0 N
  </li>
  <li>
    direction of applied force: <font face="symbol">q</font> = 0<sup>o</sup>
  </li>
  <li>
    kinetic coefficient of friction: <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub> = 0.20
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
   Make observations and calculations like those in Activities 1 and
   2, and write down what you observe and conclude.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Repeat Exercise 1, but with an applied force
   that is not horizontal.  E.g., take <font face="symbol">q</font> =
   30<sup>o</sup>.
