    <div class="title">Activities on Internal Energy</div>

    <p>
      The following Activities are for the 'Friction and Internal Energy'
      applet.  Make sure you know how the applet functions by consulting
      Help and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 1</b>.  The purpose of Activity 1 is to investigate
      what happens to the work done on the block by the applied force
      when the block is moving with constant speed and its kinetic energy
      is not changing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  Set the following parameters
      and the following initial conditions at <i>t</i> = 0 for the block:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      mass: <i>m</i> = 5.0 kg
      </li>
      <li>
      initial position: <i>x</i>(0) = 0
      </li>
      <li>
      initial velocity: <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0) = 2.0 m/s
      </li>
      <li>
        magnitude of applied force: <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i> = 9.8 N
      </li>
      <li>
        direction of applied force: <font face="symbol">q</font> = 0<sup>o</sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        kinetic coefficient of friction: <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub> = 0.20
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Display the energy box.  With the settings above, it displays two
      columns of non-zero height, the kinetic energies <i>KE</i>(0) and
      <i>KE</i>.  Of course, at <i>t</i> = 0 the instantaneous kinetic
      energy <i>KE</i> is necessarily equal to the initial kinetic energy
      <i>KE</i>(0).  At the start, the work <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> done
      by the applied force and the change <font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> in the internal energy of the
      block-table system are zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. PLAY the motion, and observe the changes in the
      energy bars.  PAUSE the applet.  Then REWIND it, and observe again.
      In a sentence or two, write down what you observe and explain the
      change in the internal energy <i>U</i> of the block-table system in
      view of energy conservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>.  Display the data box when the motion is paused,
      and given the values of <i>t</i>, <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>, and
      <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i>, calculate the change <font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> in the block's position and the work
      done on the block by the applied force.  From the latter, given
      that the block's kinetic energy is constant in this case, predict
      the change <font face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> in the internal
      energy of the block-table system.  Compare your answers to the
      values in the data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question</b>.  Why is the work <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> done by
      the applied force on the block equal to the change in internal
      energy of the block-table system, and not equal to the change in
      internal energy of just the block?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>.  <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> is the total external work
      done on the block-table system and, by the law of energy
      conservation, must equal the change in the total energy of this
      system.  The system's energy consists of two parts: kinetic energy
      and internal energy.  The kinetic energy is constant in this case.
      Therefore, <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> must be equal to the change in
      the internal energy of this system.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible theoretically to consider just the block alone.
      However, then must add to <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> the work
      <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> done by the friction force acting on the
      block.  The sum is the total external work done on the block and,
      by energy conservation, must equal the change in the block's
      energy.  However, in practice, it is impossible to calculate
      <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i>.  To calculate this work one would need to
      know the tiny displacements of the surface irregularities at the
      bottom of the block during the block's motion and the individual
      forces acting on these.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> is <b>not</b> equal to
      -<i>W<sub>appl</sub></i>.  If that were the case, the block's
      internal energy would have to remain constant, which is clearly not
      true.  The block gets warmer which means that its internal energy
      must increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 2</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is to investigate
      what happens to the work done on the block by the friction force
      when there is no applied force acting on the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  Set the following parameters
      and the following initial conditions at <i>t</i> = 0 for the block:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      mass: <i>m</i> = 5.0 kg
      </li>
      <li>
      initial position: <i>x</i>(0) = 0
      </li>
      <li>
      initial velocity: <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0) = 2.0 m/s
      </li>
      <li>
        magnitude of applied force: <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i> = 0
      </li>
      <li>
        direction of applied force: <font face="symbol">q</font> = 0<sup>o</sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        kinetic coefficient of friction: <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub> = 0.20
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Display the energy box.  With the settings above, it displays two
      columns of non-zero height, the kinetic energies <i>KE</i>(0) and
      <i>KE</i>.  Of course, at <i>t</i> = 0 the instantaneous kinetic
      energy <i>KE</i> is necessarily equal to the initial kinetic energy
      <i>KE</i>(0).  At the start, the work <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> done
      by the applied force and the change <font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> in the internal energy of the
      block-table system are zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. PLAY the motion, and observe the changes in the
      energy bars until the block comes to a stop.  Then REWIND the
      applet, and observe again.  In a sentence or two, write down what
      you observe and explain the change in the internal energy <i>U</i>
      of the block-table system in view of energy conservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>.  From the settings of <i>m</i> and
      <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0), calculate the value <i>KE</i>(0) of the
      initial kinetic energy, and predict the change in the internal
      energy of the block-table system from the beginning of the motion
      until the motion comes to a stop.  Compare your results with the
      values listed in the data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>.  REWIND the applet, display the data box, and
      note down the value of the friction force.  Calculate this value
      from the settings for <i>m</i> and <font
      face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion until the block comes to a stop.  Given the values
      of <i>t</i>, <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0), <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i> (during the
      motion, <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i> is unequal to 0), and <i>m</i>,
      calculate the block's displacement <font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> until the block comes to a stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculate the product <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i><font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i>.  This product <b>looks like</b> it
      is equal to the work <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> done by friction.
      However, it is <b>not</b> equal to <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> because
      <font face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> is not equal to the
      displacements of the small irregularites at the bottom of the block
      that momentarily lock with those at the surface of the table, bend,
      and brake contact while the block is moving.  We need to consider
      these latter displacments to calculate <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i>.
    </p>
      Nevertheless, equate the value of <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i><font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> with the sum of <font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>K</i> and <font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>U<sub>block</sub></i>,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i><font face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> =
      <font face="symbol">D</font><i>K</i> + <font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>U<sub>block</sub></i> (INCORRECT).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> = 0 in the present case, this
      equation should give us the change in the block's internal energy
      if <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i><font face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i>
      were indeed the friction work <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i>.  You should
      find <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i><font face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i>
      = -10.0 J.  Together with <font face="symbol">D</font><i>K</i> =
      -10.0 J, the preceding equation, if true, would imply <font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>U<sub>block</sub></i> = 0.  This is
      clearly incorrect because <font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>U<sub>block</sub></i> is greater than
      zero.  The block's internal energy increases as the block is
      sliding to a stop while getting warmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moral of this story is that we cannot calculate friction work by
      using the displacement of the center of mass of the block and that
      there is no practical way of calculating the change in the block's
      internal energy resulting from the presence of friction.  We only
      can calculate the change in the internal energy of the block-table
      system for which we do <b>not</b> need to calculate the work done by
      friction because this work does not amount to an <b>external</b>
      transfer of energy for the block-table system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 3</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is repeat the kinds
      of observations and calculations from Activities 1 and 2 in a more
      general case where the velocity is not constant and the motion does
      not come to a stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  Set the following parameters
      and the following initial conditions at <i>t</i> = 0 for the block:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      mass: <i>m</i> = 5.0 kg
      </li>
      <li>
      initial position: <i>x</i>(0) = 0
      </li>
      <li>
      initial velocity: <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0) = -2.0 m/s
      </li>
      <li>
        magnitude of applied force: <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i> = 20.0 N
      </li>
      <li>
        direction of applied force: <font face="symbol">q</font> = 0<sup>o</sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        kinetic coefficient of friction: <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub> = 0.20
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Make observations and calculations like those in Activities 1 and
      2, and write down what you observe and conclude.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Repeat Exercise 1, but with an applied force
      that is not horizontal.  E.g., take <font face="symbol">q</font> =
      30<sup>o</sup>.
