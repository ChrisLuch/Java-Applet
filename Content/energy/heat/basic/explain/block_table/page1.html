 <div class="title">Thermal Energy or Internal Energy</div>

 <p>
   The terms <i>thermal energy</i> and <i>internal energy</i> are
   taken to mean the same thing here.  "Internal energy" is the
   standard technical term while "thermal energy" is perhaps a bit
   more colloquial.
 </p>

 <p>
   Suppose a block is sliding on a horizontal table with friction.  An
   applied horizontal force <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
   align="bottom"><sub>appl</sub> is acting on the block.  The applied
   force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the
   friction force so that the net force acting on the block is zero
   and the block is moving with constant velocity.  Figure 1 below
   illustrates these conditions with an image taken with the applet on
   Page 2 at time
   <i>t</i> = 0.
 </p>

   <b>Figure 1</b>
 </p>
 <p>
   The table surface is represented as an <i>x</i>-axis pointing to
   the right.  The "velocitometer" shows the <i>x</i>-component of the
   block's velocity to be 2.0 m/s.
 </p>
 <p>
   Suppose we freeze the motion at <i>t</i> = 1.16 s.  Figure 2 below
   shows data from the applet's data box pertaining to this instant
   and energy bars corresponding to the instants <i>t</i> = 0 and
   <i>t</i> = 1.16 s.
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <img src="InternalEnergyBars.gif" alt="Energy Bars and Data">
 <br>
   <b>Figure 2</b>
 </p>
 <p>
   The work <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> done on the block by the applied
   force during the 1.16-s time interval is equal to 22.74 J and
   represented by the purple bar in the box for <i>t</i> = 1.16 s.
   The kinetic energy has not changed during this time interval
   because the block's speed is constant.  Where did the energy go
   that has been supplied in the form of applied work?
 </p>
 <p>
   All of this energy was converted into <i>internal energy</i> of the
   block-table system.  Both the block and the table are getting a bit
   warmer in the process.  The internal energy of the block-table
   system is denoted by the symbol <i>U</i>.  The data box shows that
   the change <font face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> in this internal
   energy during the 1.16-s time interval is 22.74 J, exactly the same
   as the amount of applied work done.  The green bar representing
   <font face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> in the energy box for <i>t</i>
   = 1.16 s has exactly the same height as the purple bar representing
   the applied work done.
 </p>
 <p>
   Go to Page 2 to repeat this experiment with the applet yourself.
   Take the block's mass to be 5.0 kg, set the kinetic coefficient of
   friction to 0.20, set the magnitude of the applied force to 9.8 N,
   and set the velocity to 2.0 m/s.  This reproduces the conditions on
   which Figures 1 and 2 are based.
