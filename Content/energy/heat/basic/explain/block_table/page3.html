 <div class="title">Thermal Energy or Internal Energy</div>

 <p>
   In the block-table system simulated by the applet on Page 2, the
   only kind of external energy transfer to this system is the work
   <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> done by the applied force. In the special
   case in which the block is moving with constant velocity, when the
   applied force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to
   the friction force, there is no change in the system's mechanical
   energy.  The block's kinetic energy stays constant at a non-zero
   value and the table's kinetic energy remains constant at 0.
 </p>
 <p>
   If kinetic energy were the only energy of the block-table system,
   we would have an example of energy <b>non</b>-conservation: energy
   is transferred into the system without a corresponding increase in
   system energy.  However, according to the principle of energy
   conservation, it must be possible to define the total energy of the
   block-table system so that the change in this energy is equal to
   <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i>.
 </p>
 <p>
   This is accomplished by defining an <i>internal energy</i> of the
   block-table system.  Physically, this internal energy is related to
   how "warm" the system is.  The symbol for internal energy is
   <i>U</i>.  The total energy of the block-table system is the sum of
   the kinetic and internal energy, <i>KE</i> + <i>U</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
	If there is no change in the system's kinetic energy, one defines
	the internal energy simply by requiring its change <font
	face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> to satisfy the energy conservation
	equation
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> = <font face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i>,<img

   src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="5"> <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> = 0.<img src="small.gif"
   alt="space" height="1" width="40">(1)
 </p>
 <p>
   More generally, if the kinetic energy <i>KE</i> of the block-table
   system is changing, one defines <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> by
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> = <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> +
   <font face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i>.<img src="small.gif"
   alt="space" height="1" width="40">(2)
 </p>
 <p>
   Eqs.(1) and (2) assume that no other energy is being transferred to
   the system, e.g., heat.  An example of heat energy transfer is heat
   conduction from the block or table to the surrounding air.  Here we
   are assuming that such heat conduction is negligible.  Otherwise,
   it must be included in the equations above.
 </p>
 <p>
   In terms of the molecular model, the internal energy of a body can
   be explained as the mechanical energy of the molecules constituting
   the body, both their kinetic energies and the potential energies of
   interaction between the molecules.
