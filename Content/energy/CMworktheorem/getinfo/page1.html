      CM-Work Theorem
    </div>
    <p>
      The CM-work theorem for a system, or for an object that may
      be deformable, is analogous to the work-kinetic energy
      theorem for a single particle. The differences are that the
      net work must be replaced by net CM-work and that the kinetic
      energy of the particle must be replaced by translational
      kinetic energy of the system or object. (CM stands for center
      of mass.)

      <b>CM-Work Theorem For A System</b>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The theorem says that the CM-work <i>W<sub>CM,net</sub></i>
      done by the net external force acting on a system or object
      is equal to the change in the translational kinetic energy of
      the system or object. In symbols,<br>

      where <i>M</i> is the mass of the system or object and
      <i>V</i> the speed of the CM of the system. For a definition

        Only the CM-work done by the external forces is needed in
        Equ.(1). The total CM-work done by all internal forces is
        zero because in calculating the CM-work all forces get
        multiplied by the same displacement, that of the CM, and
        because the sum of all internal forces is zero by Newton's
        third law. In contrast, the work done on a system by all
        internal forces is not zero in general because the points
        at which the forces are acting undergo different
        displacements so that a common displacement cannot be
        factored out.
      </li>
      <li>
        The quantity (<i>M</i>/2)<i>V</i><sup>2</sup> is called
        <i>translational kinetic energy</i> of the system or
        object. It is sometimes also called <i>kinetic energy of
        the CM</i>, for obvious reasons. However, in using the
        latter name one must realize that it has no literal meaning
        because the CM of a system of particles or of an
        arbitrarily shaped object is a fictitious point at which no
        mass may reside at all and that therefore cannot have true
        kinetic energy either.
      </li>
      <li>
        A system of particles or an extended body can have other
        kinetic energies besides the translational kinetic energy
        (<i>M</i>/2)<i>V</i><sup>2</sup> if the particles
        comprising the system or body perform motions
        <b>relative</b> to the CM, in addition to the motion that
        they share with the CM.
      </li>
      <li>
        The work-kinetic energy theorem for a single particle is a
        special case of the CM-work theorem. For the case of a
        single particle, the position of the CM is identical with
        the position of the particle, the forces acting on the
        particle are necessarily external forces, and the net
        CM-work done is identical with the net work done.

      <b>Example</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose a skater is pushing off a wall, as in the illustration
      below, and that the wall exerts a constant force <img
      src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"> on the skater where
      the wall is in contact with the skater's hand.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="SkaterAtWall.gif" alt="Skater Pushing Off Wall">
    </p>
    <p>
      The illustration shows the skater initially when the skater is
      at rest and at a later instant when the skater's CM has
      undergone the displacement <img src="d.gif" alt="vector
      d"><sub>CM</sub>.  The skater is in contact with the wall
      throughout this displacement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CM-work done by the wall on the skater is equal to
      <i>Fd<sub>CM</sub></i>. By the CM-work theorem, assuming the
      skater glides with negligible friction so that there is no
      CM-work done on the skater by friction,
      <i>Fd<sub>CM</sub></i> is equal to the change in the skater's
      translational kinetic energy or, since the skater started
      from rest, equal to the skater's translational kinetic energy
      (<i>M</i>/2)<i>V</i><sup>2</sup> at the end of the
      displacement,
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "240"><i>Fd<sub>CM</sub></i> =
      (<i>M</i>/2)<i>V</i><sup>2</sup> . <img src="small.gif"
      alt="space" height="1" width="40"> (2)
    </p>
    <p>
      If one knows the magnitude <i>d<sub>CM</sub></i> of the
      displacement of the skater's CM and knows the skater's speed
      <i>V</i> at the end of the displacement, one can use this
      equation to calculate the magnitude of the force exerted by
      the wall on the skater.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment</u>. In contrast to the CM-work theorem, the
      work-kinetic energy theorem for systems or extended objects
      provides no useful information when applied to the skater.  The
      reason is that it involves the work done by all forces, external
      and internal, and includes all forms of kinetic energy, not only
      the translational kinetic energy of the system. We have no
      information about either the work done by the internal forces
      nor the kinetic energies of the parts of the system or object
      relative to the CM.
