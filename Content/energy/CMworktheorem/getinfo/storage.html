 <p>However, the law of conservation of energy provides useful
        information.  Since the external work done on the skater is
        zero, there is no energy input into the system consisting of
        the skater.  Therefore, the law of energy conservation applied
        to the skater implies that the skater's total energy remains
        constant while he pushes off the wall.  The skater's total
        energy consists of several kinds of energy: mainly his
        translational kinetic energy and internal energy in the form
        of thermal energy and chemical energy.  When the skater pushes
        off the wall, his translational kinetic energy and his thermal
        energy increase.  (The skater will get a bit warmer.)  This
        energy increase must be compensated by a corresponding
        decrease in the skater's chemical energy as chemical energy is
        transformed in his muscles during the process.
