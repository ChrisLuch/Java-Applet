<div class="title">CM-Work Theorem Applied To A Block On An
Incline</div>

<p>The CM-work <i>W<sub>CM,fr</sub></i> done by the friction force on
the block was calculated on Page 3 to be equal to -1.624 J.  This is
not equal to the real friction work done on the block.  The real
friction work is impossible to calculate because the displacements of
the cold-welds between the block and the incline responsible for
friction are unknown.

<p>Nevertheless, it is possible to relate <i>W<sub>CM,fr</sub></i> to
the change &Delta;<i>E<sub>therm</sub></i> in
thermal energy of the system consisting of the block <b>and</b>
incline if one applies the law of conservation of energy to this
system.  It is not possible to say something about the increase in
thermal energy of the block alone, or the incline alone, if one does
not know the real friction work done on either.

<p>The CM-work theorem applied to the block gives the equation

<p align="center"><i>W<sub>CM,a</sub></i>
+ <i>W<sub>CM,g</sub></i> = &Delta;<i>KE</i> -
<i>W<sub>CM,fr</sub></i> <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="40">(1)</p>

<p>where <i>KE</i> is the block's translational kinetic energy.

<p>The law of conservation of energy applied to the block-incline
system gives the equation

<p align="center"><i>W<sub>a</sub></i> +
<i>W<sub>g</sub></i> = &Delta;<i>KE</i> + &Delta;<i>E<sub>therm</sub></i>.

<p><b>Comments</b>

<p><ol>

<li>In Eq.(2), the work on the left-hand side is real work, in
contrast to Eq.(1) where the work on the left-hand side is CM-work.</li>

<p><li>The only energy input into the block-incline system is the work
done by the applied and gravitational forces because these are the
only <b>external</b> forces acting on the system.  Friction is an
internal force and therefore no friction work should be included on
the left-hand side of Eq.(2).</li>

<p><li>Friction is an external force when the system is taken to be
just the block, and therefore the CM-work due to friction must be
included in Eq.(1).</li>

</ol>

<p>In the present case, where the block is not rotating, the
displacements of the points at which the applied and gravitational
forces are acting are equal to the displacements of the CM of the
block.  Therefore, the amounts of real work done by the applied and
gravitational forces on the block are equal to the amounts of CM-work
done by these forces on the block,

<p align="center"><i>W<sub>a</sub></i> =
<i>W<sub>CM,a</sub></i> <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="30">
and <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="30"> <i>W<sub>g</sub></i> =
<i>W<sub>CM,g</sub></i>. <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="30"> (3)</p>

<p>Thus, the left-hand sides of Eqs. (1) and (2) are equal.
Therefore, the right-hand sides must be equal also, which implies

<p align="center">&Delta;<i>E<sub>therm</sub></i>
= -<i>W<sub>CM,fr</sub></i> = -(-1.624) = 1.624 J.<img src="small.gif"
height="1" width="30"> (4)</p>

<p>Thus, the negative of the CM-work done on the block is equal to the
change in the thermal energy of the block-incline system.
