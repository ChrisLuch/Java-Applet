<div class="title">CM-Work Theorem Applied To A Block On An
Incline</div>

<p>Let's have a look at a system with <b>four</b> external forces
acting on it.  The system consists of a block.  The block can slide on
an incline with friction. The four forces are an applied force <img
src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>a</sub>, the gravitational force <img
src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>g</sub>, the friction force <img
src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>fr</sub>, and the normal force <img
src="N.gif" align="bottom">.  The free-body diagram for the block is
shown at top right in the applet window, along with the
<i>x</i>,<i>y</i> axes that will be used in the calculations.

<p><b>Question</b>.  Suppose the inclination angle <font
face="symbol">q</font> of the incline is 20<sup>o</sup>, the coefficient
of friction between block and incline is 0.5, the block's mass is 0.4
kg, and the applied force is equal to (2.0, 3.0) N with respect to the
<i>x</i>,<i>y</i> axes shown.  Then, if the block's initial velocity
is 2 m/s up the incline, what is the block's speed after the block has
moved a distance <i>d</i> = 2 m?

<p>Take the magnitude <i>g</i> of the acceleration due to gravity
equal to 10.0 m/s<sup>2</sup>.

<p><b>Hint</b>. Use the CM-work theorem (see under Related Items).
The normal force does no work on the block, because it is at right
angles to the block's displacement.  Thus, the combined CM-work done
by the applied force, the friction force, and the gravitational force
is equal to the change in (<i>M</i>/2)<i>V</i><sup>2</sup>, where
<i>m</i> and <i>v</i> are the mass of the block and the speed of the
block's center of mass (CM), respectively.
