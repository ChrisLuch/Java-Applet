<div class="title">Activities on the CM-Work theorem applied to a
Block Sliding on a Horizontal Table</div>

 <p>
   The following Activities are for the Static and Kinetic Friction
   applet.  Make sure you know how the applet functions by consulting
   Help, Assumptions, and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's
   Help menu.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 1</b>.  The purpose of Activity 1 is to use the CM-work
   theorem to predict the final speed of a block subject to an applied
   force and to friction.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet. Set the static coefficient of
   friction to 0.30 and the kinetic coefficient of friction to 0.20.
   Set the applied force to a magnitude of 20.0 N and keep its
   direction horizontal.  Keep the initial velocity equal to 0 and the
   block's mass equal to 5.0 kg.
 </p>
 <p>
   PLAY the block's motion until the block has undergone a
   displacement of 2.00 m.  You may want to use the STEP button to
   complete the motion when the block's displacement gets near the
   2.00-m value.
 </p>
 <p>
   Use the CM-work theorem to predict the speed of the block for the
   displacement &Delta;<i>x</i> = 2.00 m.
   Remember that there are two external forces acting on the block,
   the applied force and the friction force.  Both are doing CM-work
   on the block, and the amounts of CM-work done by these two forces
   must be added to give the net CM-work done on the block.  The net
   CM-work is required in the CM-work theorem,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>W<sub>CM,net</sub></i> = &Delta; [<i>M</i>/2
   <i>V</i><sup>2</sup>], <img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space"
   height="1" width="40">(1)
 </p>
 <p>
   where <i>M</i> is the mass of the block and <i>V</i> the speed of
   the block's center of mass (CM).  Let's call <i>V</i> the speed of
   the block.
 </p>
 </p>
	Calculate the magnitude <i>F<sub>fric</sub></i> of the friction
	force from the expression
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>F<sub>fric</sub></i> = &mu;<sub>k</sub>
   <i>N</i> <img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="40">(2)
 </p>
 <p>
   where <i>N</i> is the magnitude of the normal force. In the present
   case, <i>N</i> = <i>Mg</i> where <i>g</i> the magnitude of the
   acceleration due to gravity, which the applet takes as 9.8
   m/s<sup>2</sup>.  Display the data box to compare your value for
   the friction.
 </p>
 <p>
   In the present case, in which the initial kinetic energy is 0, the
   CM-work theorem directly gives you the block's (translational)
   kinetic energy <i>M</i>/2 <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> corresponding to the
   2.00-m displacement.  Compare the value you obtain for the kinetic
   energy with that in the data box.  The value in the data box may
   differ slightly from yours because of round-off error.
 </p>
   From the value of <i>M</i>/2 <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> calculate the
   block's speed <i>V</i> at &Delta;<i>x</i> =
   2.00 m, and compare your answer with the value for the block's
   velocity <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> given in the data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 2</b>.  REWIND the applet, and change the block's
   initial velocity to <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = 2.0 m/s.  Otherwise, use
   the same settings for the applet as in Exercise 1.  Again, use the
   CM-work theorem to predict the block's kinetic energy when the
   block has undergone a displacement of 2.00 m and from that the
   block's speed at this point.
 </p>
 <p>
	Equ.(1) gives the <b>change</b> in the block's kinetic energy.
   Since the block's initial kinetic energy is not 0 in this case, one
   more step than in Exercise 1 will be required in the calculation of
   the block's kinetic energy at &Delta;<i>x</i>
   = 2.00 m.  Again, PLAY the motion and compare your answers with
   those in the applet's data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 3</b>.  REWIND the applet, and repeat Exercise 2, but
   with the initial velocity set to <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = -2.0 m/s.
   Note that the block first moves left, comes to a stop momentarily,
   and then moves right.  When the block's displacement is &Delta;<i>x</i>
	 = 2.00 m, the block is at the same
   final point as in the previous Exercise.  Is the block's speed at
   this point the same as in Exercise 2?  If not, in a few sentences
   explain why not.  (Hint: Compare the directions of the friction
   force in Exercises 2 and 3.  Watch the free-body diagram as the
   motion progresses.)
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 4</b>.  Repeat Exercises 1 to 3 with different settings
   for the kinetic coefficient of friction, initial velocity, applied
   force, and mass of the block.  In particular, include a run without
   friction.
 </p>
 <p>
   If you choose an applied force that forms a non-zero angle with the
   horizontal, pay attention to the fact that the magnitude <i>N</i>
   of the normal force needed in Equ.(2) is not equal to <i>Mg</i>.
   In general, <i>N</i> must be calculated as follows.
 </p>
 <p>
   Apply Newton's second law in the <i>y</i>-direction (vertical
   direction) to the block.  The gravitational force, normal force,
   and applied force have non-zero <i>y</i>-components in general.
   Since <i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = 0, Newton's seond law applied to the
   block implies that
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>N</i> + <i>F<sub>appl,y</sub></i> - <i>Mg</i> = 0. <img
   src="small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40">(3)
 </p>
   whence
 <p align="center">
   <i>N</i> = <i>Mg</i> - <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i> sin &theta;<img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space"
   height="1" width="40">(4)
 </p>
 <p>
   where &theta; is the angle between the applied
   force and the horizontal.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 2</b>.  The purpose of Activity 2 is to investigate the
   difference between CM-work and work in relation to energy
   conservation.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Set the static coefficient of
   friction to 0.30 and the kinetic coefficient of friction to 0.20.
   Set the initial velocity equal to 2.0 m/s. Keep the block's mass
   equal to 5.0 kg.
 </p>
 <p>
   Adjust the magnitude of the applied force so that the block's
   acceleration is zero.  This should be at <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i> =
   9.8 N if the applied force is horizontal.  Make sure the force is
   horizontal.
 </p>
 <p>
   For these settings, calculate both the work <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i>
   and the CM-work <i>W<sub>CM,appl</sub></i> done by the applied
   force on the block if the block's displacement is &Delta;<i>x</i> = 2.00 m.
   (<i>W<sub>CM,appl</sub></i> = <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> because the
   CM has the same displacement as the point at which the applied force
   is acting.)
 </p>
 <p>
	PLAY/STEP the motion until the block's displacement is &Delta;<i>x</i>
	 = 2.00 m, and compare your value of
   <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> with that displayed in the data box.  The
   (equal) value of the CM-work done by the applied force is not
   listed.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 2</b>. What happens to the energy transferred when the
   work <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> is done on the block under the
   conditions considered in Example 1?  The block is not gaining any
   kinetic energy because the block's velocity is constant.  
 </p>
 <p>
	To answer this question, let us first consider the system
   consisting of both the block and the table.  This system has two
   kinds of energy: translational kinetic energy of the block,
   <i>KE</i>, and internal energy of both the block and the table,
   <i>U</i>.  Another word for the latter is <i>thermal energy</i>.
   The table remains at rest and has no translational kinetic energy.
   The work done by the applied force on this system is work done by
   an external force and therefore amounts to a transfer of energy to
   the system.  Under the given conditions, the kinetic energy does
   not increase.  How about the internal energy?  Let's use the applet
   to find out.
 </p>
 <p>
   REWIND the applet, and make no changes in the applet's settings.
   Display the box with the energy bars.  Observe that initially the
   applied work <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> and the change &Delta;<i>U</i>
	in the internal energy <i>U</i> of
   the block-table system are zero.
 </p>
 <p>
   PLAY/STEP the motion until the block has the displacement &Delta;<i>x</i>
	= 2.00 m, and observe how the bars
   representing <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> and &Delta;<i>U</i>
	change during the motion.  They
   should be rising steadily so that <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> = &Delta;<i>U</i>
	at all times.  Also observe that the
   block's kinetic energy <i>KE</i> remains equal to the initial
   kinetic energy <i>KE</i>(0).
 </p>
 <p>
   REWIND the applet, and PLAY the motion again.  This time display
   the data box and observe that <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> = &Delta;<i>U</i>
	at all times while <i>KE</i> =
   <i>KE</i>(0) = 10.0 J.  Record the values of
   <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i>, <i>KE</i>(0), <i>KE</i>, and &Delta;<i>U</i> for
	&Delta;<i>x</i> = 2.00 m.
 </p>
 <p>
   In a few sentences, summarize your observations and how they
   support the law of conservation of energy.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Example 3</b>.  The observations in Example 2 show that, as long
   as the velocity of the block remains constant, all of the energy
   transferred to the block-table system via
   <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> is converted to internal energy of the
   system.  Both the block and the table get warmer.  None of this
   work is converted to translational kinetic energy.  What if the
   block is accelerating and its velocity not constant?
 </p>
 <p>
   REWIND the applet, and change the magnitude of the applied force to
   20.0 N.  Keep the direction of the force horizontal, and do not
   change any of the other settings.  Again, PLAY/STEP the motion
   until the block's displacement is &Delta;<i>x</i> = 2.00 m.  Display the energy box,
   and observe the bars representing <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i>,
   <i>KE</i>, and &Delta;<i>U</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
   REWIND the applet, and change none of its settings.  PLAY/STEP the
   motion again, but this time with the data box displayed.  Observe
   the values of <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i>, <i>KE</i>, and &Delta;<i>U</i>
	during the motion.  Record the
   values of <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i>, <i>KE</i>(0), <i>KE</i>, and
   &Delta;<i>U</i> for &Delta;<i>x</i> = 2.00 m.
 </p>
 <p>
   Describe your observations in a few sentences, and explain how they
   support the law of energy conservation.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 4</b>.  Exercises 2 and 3 deal with the change &Delta;<i>U</i>
	in internal energy of the
   block-table system.  The law of energy conservation applied to this
   system demands that 
 </p>
 <p align="center">
	<i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> = &Delta;<i>KE</i> +
   &Delta;<i>U</i>.<img src="small_orange.gif"
   alt="space" height="1" width="40">(5)
 </p>
 <p>
	One can use this equation to calculate &Delta;<i>U</i> since <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> and
   &Delta;<i>KE</i> can be calculated.  Calculate
   <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> and &Delta;<i>KE</i>
   for the settings in Examples 2 and 3.  Then calculate the
   corresponding &Delta;<i>U</i>.  Compare your
   values for &Delta;<i>U</i> with those you
   recorded when doing Examples 2 and 3.
 </p>
 <p>
   Hint: &Delta;<i>KE</i> can be calculated using
   the CM-work theorem, i.e., Equ.(1).  This is done in Activity 1,
   Exercise 2 for the settings in Example 3. <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i>
   should be calculated from the definition of work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>Exercise 5</b>.  What about the change in the internal energy of
   just the block or just the table?  Can that be calculated similarly to
	the way the internal energy of the block-table
   system is calculated in Exercise 4?
 </p>
 <p>
   To answer this question one needs to treat the block (or the table)
   as the system and needs to know how much work is done on this
   system by the external forces acting on it.  Let us consider the
   block first.  There are two external forces acting on it: the
   applied force and the friction force.  (For the block-table system,
   friction is an internal force, but for the system consisting of
   just the table it is an external force.)
 </p>
 <p>
   To take the simplest possible case, let <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i> =
	<i>F<sub>fric</sub></i> = 9.8 N so that the block's velocity is
	constant.  (All other settings are assumed to be as in Examples
	1-4.)  
 </p>
 <p>
	First calculate the CM-work <i>W<sub>CM,fric</sub></i> done on the
	block by friction in this process.  Its value should be equal to
	-<i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> because the friction force is directed
	opposite to the applied force while its magnitude is equal to that
	of the applied force and because the CM's displacement is equal to
	that of the point at which the applied force is acting.  
 </p>
 <p>
	REWIND the applet, set <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i> = 9.8 N, but don't
	change any of the other settings.  PLAY/STEP the motion until &Delta;<i>x</i>
	= 2.00 m.  Check your value for
	<i>W<sub>CM,fric</sub></i> against that for <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i>
	displayed in the data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   Next calculate the work <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> done on the block
   by friction.  Do you expect it to be equal to
   <i>W<sub>CM,fric</sub></i>, just as <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> is
   equal to <i>W<sub>CM,appl</sub></i>?
 </p>
 <p>
   It would be tempting to answer YES to this question, but that is
   not the right answer.  The truth is that <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i>
   can <b>not</b> be equal to
   <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i>&Delta;<i>x</i>,
   which is equal to <i>W<sub>CM,fric</sub></i>.  &Delta;<i>x</i>,
	which is the displacement of the CM
   of the block is <b>not</b> the right displacement to take when
   calculating <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i>.
 </p>
 <p>
   To see why not, suppose that <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> =
   <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i>&Delta;<i>x</i> =
   W<sub>CM,fric</sub></i>.  Then, since W<sub>CM,fric</sub></i> =
   -W<sub>appl</sub></i>, it would follow that
   <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> = -W<sub>appl</sub></i>.  Therefore, the
   net work done by the external forces acting on the block,
   <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> + W<sub>appl</sub></i>, would be zero.
   This means no energy would be transferred to the block.  Since the
   block's kinetic energy is constant in the given process, the
   block's internal energy would have to be constant as well, by the
   law of energy conservation.  The block would not get warmer.  This
   is contradicted by the observations and is also inconsistent with
   the the result obtained in Example 4.  (Note that a similar
   argument would show that the internal energy of the table is zero
   as well.  Carry out this argument, calculating the work done by
   friction on the table using the displacement of the table's CM
   which is zero.
 </p>
 <p>
   The fact of life is that it is <b>impossible</b> to calculate the
   work done by friction on either the block or the table.  The reason
   is that we cannot know the displacements of the points at which the
   friction force is acting.  The friction force is acting at the many
   tiny surface irregularities at the contacting surfaces, and these
   irregularities bend elastically to a certain degree before snapping
   back into position while the two surfaces are moving relative to
   each other.  The displacements of these irregularities is what one
   would need to know to be able to calculate <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i>.
   Note that the applet does not list values for
   <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> in the data box.
