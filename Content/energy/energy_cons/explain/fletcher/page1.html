<div class="title">Energy Conservation in Fletcher's Trolley</div>

<p><b>Preparation</b>: Energy/Potential Energy/Explain It/Uniform
Force.</p>

<p>The Fletcher Trolley apparatus shown on the left is frictionless.
Therefore the mechanical energy of the system consisting of this
apparatus and the earth is conserved.  The mechanical energy is the
sum of the kinetic energies of all moving parts and the gravitational
potential energy.  As always, the earth's kinetic energy can be
ignored.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>. Drag block 1 to the left until block 2 is raised
to a height of h = 2.5 m.  Then run the simulation until block 1
reaches h = 0.  Can you predict, using energy conservation, what the
speed of the two blocks will be at this moment?  Try it.</p>
