<p><b>Answer</b>.  As the simulation shows, when the two blocks start
from rest, they reach a speed of 4.4 m/s when block 2 has dropped a
distance of 2.5 m.  This is assuming that the masses of blocks 1 and 2
are 0.6 kg and 0.4 kg, respectively, and that the pulley is
massless.</p>

<p>The calculation that leads to this result will now be explained,
but first run the simulation once more and observe the energy bar on
the right.  Initially the energy is all potential energy (blue).
Then, during the motion, more and more of the potential energy is
replaced by the kinetic energies of the two blocks (red and grey)
while the sum of all three energies remains constant.</p>

<p>You can enlarge the energy bar to 2x, 3x, 4x, 0.5x, and then again
1x by clicking the button that is so designated.<p>

<p>Energy conservation implies that the initial energy of the system,</p>

<p align="center"><i>E<sub>in</sub></i> = <i>KE<sub>1,in</sub></i> +
<i>KE<sub>2,in</sub></i> + <i>PE<sub>in</sub></i>,</p>

<p>is equal to the final energy of the system,</p>

<p align="center"><i>E<sub>fin</sub></i> = <i>KE<sub>1,fin</sub></i> +
<i>KE<sub>2,fin</sub></i> + <i>PE<sub>fin</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Note that we have two kinetic energy terms, one for each block, but
only one potential energy term, which in this case is the
gravitational potential energy of block 2 and the earth, which can be
taken to be <i>m<sub>2</sub>gh</i>, where <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> is the
mass of block 2.</p>

<p>If you did not do the calculation earlier, can you do it now, using
the equality of the initial and final energies?</p>
