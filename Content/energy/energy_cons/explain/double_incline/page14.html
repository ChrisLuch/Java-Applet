<p><b><center>What is the Acceleration?</center></b>

<p>We have derived that

<p><center>(M + f m)a<sub>z</sub> = -m<sub>1</sub>g sin <font
face="symbol"> a</font> + m<sub>2</sub>g sin<font
face="symbol"> b</font></center>

<p>where M = m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub> is the sum of the masses of
the two blocks, m is the mass of the pulley, and f = 0.8 for the
present pulley.  Use the equation above to predict the acceleration for
the three limiting cases described on the last page, and then run the
simulation to check your answers.

<p>Before closing, in your notebook, summarize the theory of the
double incline using energy conservation.  Try to do the derivation of
the equation above without looking at your notes.
