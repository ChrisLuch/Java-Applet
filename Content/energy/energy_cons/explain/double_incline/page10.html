<p><b><center>What is the Acceleration?</center></b>

<p>The equation for a<sub>z</sub> can be rewritten

<center>Ma<sub>z</sub> = -m<sub>1</sub>g sin <font
face="symbol"> a</font> + m<sub>2</sub>g sin<font
face="symbol"> b</font> .</center>

<p>This means that the two blocks act like a single block of mass M
moving along a z-axis while acted upon by the sum of the z-components
of the gravitational forces acting on the blocks.

<p>So far, we have assumed the pulley mass to be negligible.  How does
the equation above have to be modified if the pulley's mass is not
zero?

<p>You can now set the pulley mass to a non-zero value and observe
the acceleration.  Can you predict theoretically what you observe?
Try to calculate the acceleration.  The next page will show you how.
