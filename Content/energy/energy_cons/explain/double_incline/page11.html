<p><b><center>What is the Acceleration?</center></b>

<p>When the pulley mass was negligible, the z-component of the
acceleration was determined by

<center>Ma<sub>z</sub> = -m<sub>1</sub>g sin <font
face="symbol"> a</font> + m<sub>2</sub>g sin<font
face="symbol"> b</font> .</center>

<p>If the pulley mass is finite, all you have to do is replace M =
m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub> in this equation by

<p><center>M + I/R<sup>2</sup></center>

<p>where I is the moment of inertia of the pulley around its axis and
R the pulley's radius.  It is assumed here that the string passes over
the pulley at a distance from the axis equal to the pulley's radius R
and that the string is not slipping.  For background on the concept of
moment of inertia, click on 'Moment of Inertia' under Get Information.

<p>The additional term in the total mass comes from taking the
pulley's kinetic energy into account.  If you go back in the
derivation, you will see that M comes from the total kinetic energy of
the two blocks.  See the first equation on Page 6.  If the pulley has
kinetic energy as well, we need to add this to the first equation on
Page 6.

<p>The kinetic energy of the pulley is equal to 1/2 I<font
face="symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup>, where <font face="symbol">w</font>
is the angular speed of the pulley.  If the string is not slipping
over the pulley, then <font face="symbol">w</font> = v/R so that the
pulley's kinetic energy is given by 1/2 (I/R<sup>2</sup>)
v<sup>2</sup>.  When this is added to the right-hand side of the first
equation on Page 6, M gets replaced by the combination of M and I
listed above.

<p>The replacement of the mass M can also be understood in terms of
forces.  The explanation is given under Force/Newton's Second
Law/Explain It/Double Incline.  Intuitively, the explanation is as follows.

<p>The gravitational forces acting on the blocks must accelerate both
the pulley and the two blocks.  The pulley's inertia can be included
in the inertia of the system by increasing the total mass in the
equation at the top of the page from M to M + I/R<sup>2</sup>.

<p>The moment of inertia of the pulley is given by

<p><center>I = f m R<sup>2</sup></center>

<p>where f is a geometrical factor describing the mass distribution
in the pulley.  This factor is taken to be 0.8 in the simulation.

<p>Substituting this expression for I into the M-substitution shows
that the R<sup>2</sup>-factor cancels, giving the simple result that
in the expression for a<sub>z</sub> all we need to do is replace M by

<p><center>M + f m.</center>

<p>Having the pulley mass non-zero, simply adds the pulley mass to
the combined mass of the two blocks, except that the pulley mass is
corrected by the geometrical factor f.

<p>This leads to 

<p><center>(M + fm)a<sub>z</sub> = - m<sub>1</sub>g sin <font
face="symbol"> a</font> + m<sub>2</sub>g sin<font face="symbol">
b</font> .</center>

<p>Now work out a value for a<sub>z</sub> for the example in which
m<sub>1</sub> = 0.7 kg, m<sub>2</sub> = 0.3 kg, <font
face="symbol">a</font> = 30<sup>o</sup>, <font face="symbol">b</font>
= 60<sup>o</sup>, m = 0.5 kg, f = 0.8.

<p>When done, go to the next page and run the simulation to see if
this is the value that you observe.
