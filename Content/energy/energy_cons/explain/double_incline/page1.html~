<p><b><center>What is the Acceleration?</center></b>

<p>We want to study the acceleration of the system shown on the left.
The system is frictionless.  Thus, the system's energy is conserved.
You will learn how to use this principle to determine the
accelerations of the two blocks.</p>

<p>Click START to observe the motion.  You can stop the motion at any
point.  Determine the blocks' acceleration from the data that are
printed on the screen.  When done, go on to page 2 to check your
measurement.
