  <p><b>Work done by a constant force: definition in one, two,
  or three dimensions</b>

  <p>The definition of work done on a system is illustrated here in
  terms of a five-sided object that undergoes both translational and
  rotational motion.  Figure 1 below shows the object at the initial
  and final moments of the time interval for which we want to define
  the work done on the object.</p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

  <p>The definition of work done by a force involves the force and the
  displacement of the point at which the force is acting.  In general,
  the displacement of the point at which the force is acting is not in
  the same direction as the force.  In Figure 1, the angle between the
  force and this displacement is indicated by the symbol <font
  face="symbol">q</font> (Greek letter; read: theta).  Whether the
  directions of the displacement and that of the force are the same or
  not, the work done by the force is defined as follows.

        <p><u>Definition</u>. Suppose the force <img src="F.gif"
        alt="vector F" align="bottom"> acting on an object is
        <b>constant</b> during some time interval and that the point
        at which the force is acting on the object undergoes a
        displacement <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align="bottom">
        during this time.  Then the work <i>W</i> done on the object
        by the force is defined by

		  <p><center><i>W</i> = <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
		  align="bottom"><img src="dot.gif" alt="dot" align="bottom"><img
		  src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align="bottom"> = <i>Fd cos</i> &theta;
		  = <i>F<sub>x</sub> d<sub>x</sub></i> +
		  <i>F<sub>y</sub> d<sub>y</sub></i>,</center>

		  <p>i.e., by the scalar product (dot product) between the force
		  and the displacement. Here, &theta; is
		  the angle between the two vectors <img src="F.gif" alt="vector
		  F" align="bottom"> and <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d"
		  align="bottom">.  If the motion is three-dimensional and the
		  displacement has a non-zero z-component
		  <i>d<sub>z</sub></i>, a third term <i>F<sub>z</sub>
		  d<sub>z</sub></i> must be added to <i>F<sub>x</sub>
		  d<sub>x</sub></i> + <i>F<sub>y</sub> d<sub>y</sub></i> in the
		  equation above.  If the motion is one-dimensional and entirely
		  along the <i>x</i>-axis, only the term <i>F<sub>x</sub>
		  d<sub>x</sub></i> is needed on the right-hand side.

		  <p>The scalar product can be calculated either in terms of the
		  angle &theta; and the magnitudes <i>F</i>
		  and <i>d</i> of the two vectors or in terms of the Cartesian
		  components of the two vectors.  In the case illustrated in
		  Figure 1, the work <i>W</i> is positive because the angle
		  &theta; is less than 90 degrees so that
		  its cosine is positive. If &theta; >
		  90<sup>o</sup>, the work is negative.

		  <p><u>Comments</u>.

		  <p>1.  The point at which the force is acting is indicated by
		  a black dot in Figure 1.  The arrow representing the force is
		  drawn with its tail end placed at this point.  The stippled
		  line indicates the path along which the point moves.  The
		  shape of this path, roughly a semi-circle in Figure 1, does
		  not enter into the expression for the work above.  The only
		  thing that matters is the net displacement <img src="d.gif"
		  alt="vector d" align="bottom"> of the point of action of the
		  force.

		  <p>2.  Similarly, the fact that the object undergoes a
		  rotation during the displacement <img src="d.gif" alt="vector
		  d" align="bottom"> has no bearing on the work done by the
		  force <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom">.  What
		  matters is only the displacement of the point of action of the
		  force.

		  <p>3.  <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"> is not
		  the only force that is acting on the object.  (The other
		  forces are not shown.)  The object could not be moving along
		  the stippled path if <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
		  align="bottom"> were the only force.  (Why not?) The fact that
		  other forces are present has no bearing on how the work done
		  by just <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"> is
		  calculated.  We could calculate the work done by the other
		  forces in the same fashion.</p>  
      

		  <p>If we add the amounts of work done by all individual
		  forces, we get what is called the <i>net work</i> done on the
		  object.</p>
