      <b>Work done by a variable force: general definition</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The work <i>W</i> done by a <b>constant</b> force on a system is
      defined by
    </p>
	 <p align="center"><i>W</i> = <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
		  align="bottom"><img src="dot.gif" alt="dot" align="bottom"><img
		  src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align="bottom"> = <i>Fd cos</i> &theta;
		  = <i>F<sub>x</sub> d<sub>x</sub></i> +
		  <i>F<sub>y</sub> d<sub>y</sub></i><img src="small.gif"
         alt="space" height="1" width="40">(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      The vector <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align="bottom"> is
		  the displacement of the point at which the force is
		  acting. For details, please see Page 2.
    </p> 
    <p>
      If the force <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align= "bottom">
      varies while the displacement <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d"
      align="bottom"> occurs, either in magnitude or direction, Eq.(1)
      does not apply. Eq.(1) requires a definite force vector, but
      there is no one force vector that one could use during the
      entire time interval while the displacement <img src="d.gif"
      alt="vector d" align="bottom"> is occurring if the force is
      varying.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, although a force may be varying during a <b>finite</b>
      time interval, during an <b>infinitesimal</b> time interval it
      cannot be anything but constant.  There is not enough time for
      the force to change during such an interval.  Therefore, Eq.(1)
      does apply to an infinitesimal time interval during which the
      point at which the force is acting undergoes an infinitesimal
      displacement <i>d</i><img src="r.gif" alt= "vector r"
      align="bottom">. The corresponding infinitesimal work <i>dW</i>
      done by the force on the system is defined by
    </p>
    <p align="center">
       <i>dW</i> = <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"><img
      src= "dot.gif" alt="dot" align="bottom"><i>d</i><img src="r.gif"
      alt="vector r" align="bottom"> = <i>F</i>|<i>d</i><img
      src="r.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom">| cos</i> &theta;
		= <i>F<sub>x</sub>dx</i> +
		  <i>F<sub>y</sub>dy</i>.<img src="small.gif" alt="space"

    </p>
	 <p>
      In three dimensions, a third term <i>F<sub>z</sub>dz</i> needs
      to be added on the right-hand side of Eq.(2).  In one dimension,
      if the motion is along an <i>x</i>-axis, the term
      <i>F<sub>x</sub>dx</i> is sufficient.
	 </p>
    <p>
      The net work <i>W</i> done on the system during a <b>finite</b>
      time interval is the sum of all the infinitesimal amounts of
      work <i>dW</i> done during the infinitesimal intervals that make
      up the finite interval.  The path taken by the point at which
      the force is acting will in general be curved.  The
      infinitesimal amounts of work <i>dW</i> need to be calculated
      for the infinitesimal displacements that make up this curved
      path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technically, the sum <i>W</i> of infinitely many infinitesimal
      amounts <i>dW</i> is what is called an "integral". Calculus
      provides rules for working out such integrals.
