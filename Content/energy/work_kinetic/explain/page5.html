      Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem
    </div>
    <p>
      The work-kinetic energy theorem can be applied to the motion
      of a charged particle in a uniform electric field to relate
      the particle's displacement to changes in the particle's
      kinetic energy or speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet on Page 6 will let you simulate the motion of a
      charged particle in the uniform electric field of an infinitely
      extended parallel-plate capacitor. Details on how to use the
      applet are available under Applet Help on the applet's Help
      menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you experiment with the applet on Page 6, open the item
      "Activities Page 6" under Related Items for suggestions on
      investigations to be carried out with the applet.
