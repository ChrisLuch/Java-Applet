      Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem

    <p>
      <b>The work-kinetic energy theorem for a system of particles</b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Let there be a system consisting of <i>N</i> particles, labeled 1
    to <i>N</i>. Let us consider some time interval during
    which the net force <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
    align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> acting on Particle 1 does work
    <i>W</i><sub>1</sub> on Particle 1 and the kinetic energy of
    Particle 1 changes by <font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i><sub>1</sub>.  Similarly for
    Particles 2 to <i>N</i>.
    </p>     
    <p>
      The general work-kinetic energy theorem states that
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>W</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>W</i><sub>2</sub> + ... +
      <i>W<sub>N</sub></i> = <font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i><sub>1</sub> + <font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i><sub>2</sub> + ... + <font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>KE<sub>N</sub></i>.<img src="small.gif"

      <u>Comment 1</u>. In general, the work listed on the left-hand
      side of Eq.(1) contains work done both by internal and external
      forces.  In the applet on Page 12, there are two internal
      forces, and the work done by these forces is not zero.  There
      are no external forces.  There are other systems in which there
      are only external forces and the work done by those is not zero.
      Finally, there are systems with both internal and external
      forces, and the work done by either kind of force on the system
      is unequal to zero.
    </p>
	 <p>
      <u>Comment 2</u>.  Eq.(1) above for a system of particles is a
      straight-forward geneneralization of Eq.(1) on Page 1, which is
      the work-kinetic energy theorem for a single particle.  Eq.(1)
      on this page is obtained from the work-kinetic energy theorem
      for a single particle simply by summing over all particles.  For a
      proof of the work-kinetic energy theorem for a single particle
      see Energy/Work-Kin. En. Th'm/Explain It/Derivation.

      <b>The applet on Page 12</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the applet on Page 12 to investigate the
      work-kinetic energy theorem as it applies to a system consisting
      of two particles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system of two "particles" in the applet on Page 12 is a
      binary star system. Open "Activities Page 12" for suggestions on
      what to investigate with the applet.

      Details on how to use the applet are available under Applet
      Help on the applet's Help menu.
