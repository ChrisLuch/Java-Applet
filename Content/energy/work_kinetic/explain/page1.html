      Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem

    <p>
      <b>Work-kinetic energy theorem for a single particle</b>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The net work <i>W</i> done on a particle during a given time
      interval by the net force <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
      align="bottom"> acting on the particle is equal to the change
      in the particle's kinetic energy during that time interval.
      In symbols, 
      <p align="center">
        <i>W<sub>net</sub></i> = <font face=
        "symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> <img src="small.gif" alt="space"

      </p>where

        <i>KE</i> = (<i>m</i>/2)<i>v</i><sup>2</sup> <img src=

      </p>
      <p>
        is the particle's kinetic energy, <i>m</i> the mass of the
        particle and <i>v</i> the speed of the particle.

      On Page 11, there is a statement of a generalized
      work-kinetic energy theorem that applies to systems of more
      than one particle. For a derivation of the work-kinetic
      energy theorem, go to Energy/Work-Kin. En. Th'm/Explain
      It/Derivation.

      Pages 1 to 10 will take you through several situations
      involving one-particle systems. The applet on Page 12
      simulates the motion of a two-particle system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first example, to be studied with the applet on Page 2,
      involves a ball in vertical up-and-down motion without air
      resistance, i.e., a ball in free fall. When you experiment
      with the applet on Page 2, open the item "Activities Page 2"
      under Related Items for suggestions on what to investigate
      with the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Details on how the applet on Page 2 functions are available
      under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
