      Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem
    </div>
    <p>
      A ball carrying out projectile motion in the earth's
      gravitational field without air resistance, as simulated by
      the applet on Page 4, provides another situation to which the
      work-kinetic energy theorem can be applied. For details on
      how to use the applet, please go to Applet Help on the
      applet's Help menu. The applet on Page 4 is the same one as
      on Page 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you experiment with the applet on Page 4, open the item
      "Activities Page 4" under Related Items for suggestions on
      investigations to be carried out with the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the case of vertical free fall investigated on Page 2,
      the applications of the work-kinetic energy theorem on Page 4
      relate the displacement of a ball to changes in the kinetic
      energy and speed of the ball, but this time there is also a
      horizontal component of motion present.
