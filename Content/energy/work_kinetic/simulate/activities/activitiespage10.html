<div class="title">Activities for the Work and Kinetic Energy
Applet</div>

 <p>
   The following Activities are for the Work and Kinetic Energy applet.
   Make sure you know how the applet functions by consulting Help and
   ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 1</b>.  The purpose of Activity 1 is to verify the
   Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem for parabolic motion (constant net
   force).
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>. Suppose a particle is moving subject to a
   constant net downward force <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
   align="bottom">.  Figure 1 below shows part of the parabolic path
   of the particle, and it shows the particle in two positions that
   are 2.0 s apart and data corresponding to this time interval.
 </p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
       <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
 <p>
   Using the data from Figure 1, perform the following calculations to
   verify the Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem for this 2.0-s time interval.
 </p>
 <ul>
   <li>
     Calculate the work done on the particle by the net force <img
     src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"> as the particle
     undergoes the displacement <font face="symbol">D</font><img
     src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom">.  Note that,
     since the net force is constant, <img src="F_orange.gif"
     alt="vector F" align="bottom"> = <img src="F_orange.gif"
     alt="vector F" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub>.  
   <br> 
   <br> 
     The work done by a constant force is equal to <img
     src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"><img
     src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot" align="bottom"><font
     face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r"
     align="bottom">.  Evaluate this scalar product, and check if you
     obtain the result listed in Figure 1.
   <br> 
   <br> 
     Compare the value of <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
     align="bottom"><img src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot"
     align="bottom"><font face="symbol">D</font><img
     src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom"> to that of
     <i>W</i>.  The two values should be exactly equal in the case of
     a constant net force.  However, you will notice that the two
     values listed in Figure 1 differ in the second decimal.  This
     discrepancy is the result of round-off error due to giving the
     net force to only two significant figures.  
   <br> 
   <br> 
	  <i>W</i> denotes the exact value of the work done by the net
     force in the given time interval while <img src="F_orange.gif"
     alt="vector F" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub><img
     src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot" align="bottom"><font
     face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r"
     align="bottom"> in general only approximates <i>W</i>.  However,
     for a <b>constant</b> net force, <nobr><img src="F_orange.gif"
     alt="vector F" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub><img
     src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot" align="bottom"><font
     face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r"
     align="bottom"></nobr> is equal to
     <i>W</i>.
   <br>
	<br>  
   </li> 
	<li>  
     From the value of the velocity at the beginning of the 2-s time
     interval, <img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
     align="bottom"><sub>old</sub>, calculate the speed at the
     beginning of the interval, <i>v<sub>old</sub></i>, and the
     kinetic energy at the beginning of the interval,
     <i>K<sub>old</sub></i>.  Compare your results with the values in
     Figure 1.
   <br>
	<br>
	  Do the same with the value of the velocity at the end of the 2-s
     interval, <img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
     align="bottom"><sub>new</sub>.
   <br>
	<br>
     Then verify the Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem by demonstrating that 
	<br>
	<center>
    
     <i>W</i> = <i>K<sub>new</sub></i> - <i>K<sub>old</sub></i>.  	  

	</center>
	<br>
	</li>
	<li>
     Verify that the values of <img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
     align="bottom"><sub>old</sub>, <img src="v_orange.gif"
     alt="vector v" align="bottom"><sub>new</sub>, and <img
     src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub>
     from Figure 1 are consistent by veryfing the equation
   <br>
	<br>
	<center>    
    <img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
     align="bottom"><sub>new</sub> = <img src="v_orange.gif"
     alt="vector v" align="bottom"><sub>old</sub> + (<img
     src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
     align="bottom"><sub>av</sub> /<i>m</i>) <font
     face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>.
   </center>
	<br>
     For constant net force <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
   align="bottom"> = <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
   align="bottom"><sub>av</sub> and therefore constant acceleration
   <nobr><img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
   align="bottom"><sub>av</sub> /<i>m</i></nobr>, this equation is
   exact, no matter how large the time interval <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> is.  For variable net force and
   acceleration, it becomes exact only in the limit of vanishing <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>.
	</li> 
  </ul>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Use the applet to create a parabolic motion of
   your own by applying a constant net force.  You may want to choose
   a net force that is not downward, but in some other direction.  For
   this motion, carry out the same kinds of calculations as in
   Exercise 1 for one or more time steps.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 2</b>.  The purpose of Activity 2 is to investigate the
   Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem for a motion with variable net force.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>.  Use the applet to create a motion with variable
   net force.
 </p>
 <p>
   REWIND the applet and set the time step to 2.0 s.  STEP FORWARD
   through the motion, and stop at some 2.0-s time interval. Using the
   values in the data box, verify that the equation of the
   Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem,
 </p>
   <center>
     <i>W</i> = <i>K<sub>new</sub></i> - <i>K<sub>old</sub></i>,
   </center>
 <p>
  is satisfied.
 </p>
 <p>
  By stepping either forward or backward to other 2.0-s intervals, you
  can check that the preceding equation is satisfied for all other
  such intervals as well.  This means that the equation is also
  satisfied for larger intervals, e.g., 10-s intervals, because the
  work done and the change in kinetic energy in such an interval is
  the sum of the work and change in kinetic energy, respectively, in
  the constituent 2.0-s intervals.
 </p>
 <p>
  The question remains: "How can we calculate the work <i>W</i> listed
  in the applet's data box using the basic definition of work?"  The
  purpose of the following Exercise 2 is to answer this question.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, REWIND the applet.
 </p>
 <p>
   STEP FORWARD through the motion.  For some 2.0-s time interval,
   calculate the approximate work <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector
   F" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub><img src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot"
   align="bottom"><font face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif"
   alt="vector r" align="bottom"> done.  Compare this value to that of
   the exact work <i>W</i> listed in the data box.  If the force is varying
   during your time interval, the two are in general not going to be
   equal.
 </p>
 <p>
   The approximate work <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
     align="bottom"><sub>av</sub><img src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot"
     align="bottom"><font face="symbol">D</font><img
     src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom"> approaches the
     true work <i>W</i> as the size of the time interval decreases.
     Investigate this as follows.
 </p>
 <p>
   Suppose <i>t</i> = <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> is the instant of time at
   the beginning of the 2.0-s interval.  REWIND the applet, and reduce
   the size of the time step from 2.0 s to 1.0 s. STEP FORWARD through
   the motion until <nobr><i>t<sub>old</sub></i> =
   <i>t</i><sub>1</sub></nobr>, i.e., until you are at the beginning
   of the former 2.0-s interval.  Now, <i>t<sub>new</sub></i> =
   <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> + 1.0 s.  For the 1.0-s interval from
   <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> to <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> + 1.0 s, i.e., for the
   first half of the former 2.0-s interval, compare the values of
   <i>W</i> and <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
   align="bottom"><sub>av</sub><img src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot"
   align="bottom"><font face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif"
   alt="vector r" align="bottom"> displayed in the data box.  You can
   verify the latter by calculation, if you like.
 </p>
 <p>
   Is the percentage difference between <i>W</i> and <img
     src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
     align="bottom"><sub>av</sub><img src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot"
     align="bottom"><font face="symbol">D</font><img
     src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom"> smaller for the
     1.0-s interval than for the 2.0-s interval?  I.e., is <nobr>|<i>W</i> -
     <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
     align="bottom"><sub>av</sub><img src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot"
     align="bottom"><font face="symbol">D</font><img
     src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom">| / <i>W</i></nobr>
     smaller for the 1.0-s interval than for the 2.0-s interval?
 </p>
 <p>
   Cut the interval in half again, to 0.5 s, and repeat the comparison
   between <i>W</i> and <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
   align="bottom"><sub>av</sub><img src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot"
   align="bottom"><font face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif"
   alt="vector r" align="bottom">, and so on for even smaller
   intervals.  (The smallest interval allowed by the applet is 0.2 s.)
 </p>
 <p>
   What do you conclude?
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 3</b>.  One can learn from Exercise 2 that
   approximating <i>W</i> by <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
   align="bottom"><sub>av</sub><img src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot"
   align="bottom"><font face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif"
   alt="vector r" align="bottom"> involves an error, but an error that
   vanishes as the interval size vanishes.
 </p>
 <p>
   This leads to the following prescription for calculating <i>W</i>
   for some finite time interval.  Divide the interval into many
   smaller sub intervals, calculate <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
   align="bottom"><sub>av</sub><img src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot"
   align="bottom"><font face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif"
   alt="vector r" align="bottom"> for each of the smaller intervals,
   and sum all these small approximate amounts of work to get an
   approximate value for <i>W</i>.  Repeat this by dividing the given
   time interval into even more and even smaller subintervals,
   calculating and summing the many small amounts <img src="F_orange.gif"
   alt="vector F" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub><img
   src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot" align="bottom"><font
   face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r"
   align="bottom">, and so on for even more and even smaller
   intervals.  The resulting sequence of approximate values for
   <i>W</i> converges to the exact value of <i>W</i> as the number of
   subintervals goes to infinity and the size of each subinterval goes
   to zero.
 </p>
 <p>
   Suppose one divides a given 10-s time interval into one million
   time intervals of 1/100000 s each, and calculates <img
   src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub><img
   src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot" align="bottom"><font
   face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r"
   align="bottom"> for each of these tiny intervals.  Then the sum of
   a million tiny amounts <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
   align="bottom"><sub>av</sub><img src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot"
   align="bottom"><font face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif"
   alt="vector r" align="bottom"> is going to be very close to the
   true value of <i>W</i> for the 10-s interval.
 </p>
 <p>
   Computers can carry out calculations like this, called <i>numerical
   integration</i>, quickly.  (The word "integration" means summation.)
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 3</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is to investigate
   the Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem qualitatively.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>.  Work can be either positive or negative,
   depending on whether the force doing the work forms an angle less
   than or greater than 90<sup>o</sup> with the displacement.
   According to the work-kinetic energy theorem, the kinetic energy
   increases during a time interval for which the work is positive and
   decreases during a time interval for which the work is negative.
 </p>
 <p>
   RESET the applet.  Select the Force button.  Generate a motion by
   means of the Force dial.  Observe the red kinetic energy bar in
   relation to the angle between the black force vector and the
   magenta velocity vector.
 </p>
 <p>
   Does the kinetic energy bar increase in height when the angle
   between the force and velocity is less than 90<sup>o</sup>, i.e.,
   when the force generally speaking is in the "forward" direction,
   and decrease in height when the angle between the force and
   velocity is greater than 90<sup>o</sup>, i.e., when the force
   generally speaking is in the "backward" direction?
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 4</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is to repeat
   Activities 1 to 3 for motion along a straight line.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  Set the applet to the 1D mode.
 </p>
 <p>
   Repeat any of the exercises in Activities 1 to 3 using
   one-dimensional motions.
