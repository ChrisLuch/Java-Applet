      Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem
    </div>
    <p>
      The work-kinetic energy theorem can be applied to the motion
      of a charged particle in a uniform electric field to relate
      the particle's displacement to changes in the particle's
      kinetic energy or speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet on Page 2 lets you simulate the motion of a
      charged particle in a uniform electric field. Details on how
      to use the applet are available under Applet Help on the
      applet's Help menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      When experimenting with the applet, open the item
      "Activities" under Related Items for suggestions on
      investigations to be carried out with the applet.
