      Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem
    </div>
    <p>
      The applet on Page 2 lets you control the motion of a particle
      by controlling the force acting on the particle. The applet is
      intended to let you investigate the work-kinetic energy theorem
      for a single particle in the most general situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can apply an arbitrary and variable force to the particle
      and examine the work done by the force on the particle during a
      finite time interval and the corresponding change in the
      particle's kinetic energy. For details on how to use the applet,
      please look at Help and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's
      Help menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open "Activities" under Related Items for suggestions on
      investigations to be carried out with the applet.
