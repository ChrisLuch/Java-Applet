<div class="title">Energy - What Is It?</div>

<p>
  There is a very general principle in physics that has proven to be
  most frutiful: the <b>Principle of Energy Conservation</b>:
</p>
<blockquote>
  It is possible to define an energy for every system such that the
  energy of the system is conserved if the system is isolated and that
  the energy of the system plus its environment is conserved if there
  is energy transfer between the system and its environment. In more
  detail, this means the following.
<br>
<br>
  For different kinds of systems, energy has to be defined
  differently, e.g., as mechanical, electric, or thermal energy.  One
  kind of energy can be transformed into another kind, and energy can
  be transferred from one system to another.  The <i>principle of
  energy conservation</i> says that energy can be defined in such a
  way that the energy of an isolated system is conserved no matter
  what is happening inside the system and that the total energy of a
  system and its environment is conserved in processes involving
  energy transfer between the system and its environment.
</blockquote>
<p>
  <b>Example</b>. Imagine a system consisting of two stars revolving
  around each other, a so-called <i>binary star system</i>.  In
  response to the gravitational forces that the stars exert on each
  other, the stars in general will be following elliptical paths and
  at certain times will be getting closer to each other and at other
  times will be getting farther away from each other.  When they are
  getting closer to each other, they are getting faster and their
  kinetic energies increase.  When they are moving farther away from
  each other, the kinetic energies of the stars decrease.
</p>
<p>
  If we defined the total energy of the binary star system to be the
  sum of the kinetic energies of the two stars, this energy would
  <b>not</b> be conserved.  However, the principle of energy
  conservation tells us that it must be possible to define an energy
  for this system that <b>is</b> conserved.  One can define a
  potential energy for the system so that the sum of the kinetic and
  potential energy is conserved.  When the kinetic energy of
  the system increases, the potential energy decreases, and vice
  versa, such that the sum of the two remains unchanged.
</p>
<p>
  The applet on Page 6 simulates a binary star system and illustrates
  the system's kinetic and potential energies by means of an energy
  bar.  The total height of the bar remains constant while the bar's
  kinetic and potential energy portions are changing.
