      Energy - What Is It?
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Question</b>. Which ones of the properties of energy
      listed on Page 2 does the simulation on Page 3 illustrate?
      Try to list as many as you can think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The simulation can illustrate five of the six
      properties listed. The only one it does not illustrate is
      Property 6, that there are different kinds of energy
      transfer. Also note that the simulation treats energy as if
      it consisted of 1-J chunks while in reality energy is not
      split up like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>So - what is energy?</b> One can start by defining a
      quantity called <i>kinetic energy</i>. (See under Related
      Items.) The definitions of other forms of energy follow from
      there if one wants to define energy as a conserved quantity.
      (See Page 5 about the Principle of Energy Conservation.)
    </p>
    <p>
      E.g., one can define the <i>work</i> done on a particle,
      i.e., the amount of mechanical energy transferred to the
      particle, so that the work is equal to the change in the
      particle's kinetic energy. Once the concept of work is
      defined, one can define potential energy, etc. For more on
      this, see Page 5.
