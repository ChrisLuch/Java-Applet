  <div class="title">Kinetic Energy</div>

  <p>Kinetic energy is a <b>scalar</b> quantity.  Historically, there
  was a lot of uncertainty about what quantity would measure the
  'amount of motion' of a body.  There was debate about whether to
  choose something that we now call 'momentum', which is proportional
  to the first power of speed, or something like what we now call
  'kinetic energy', which is proportional to the second power of
  speed.  Momentum, as it is defined now, is a vector quantity, but
  kinetic energy (and any other form of energy as well), is a scalar
  quantity.  By definition, kinetic energy does <b>not</b> have a
  direction.</p>
       
  <p><u>Definition 1</u>.  The <i>kinetic energy of a point
  particle</i> is defined as follows.</p>

  <blockquote>The kinetic energy <i>K</i> of a particle of mass
  <i>m</i> and speed <i>v</i> is given by</p>

  <p align="center"><i>K</i> = (<i>m</i>/2) <i>v</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>

  <p><u>Definition 2</u>. The <i>kinetic energy of a system of point
  particles</i> is defined as follows.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="KineticEnergy2.gif"></p>

  <blockquote>The kinetic energy <i>K</i> of a system of particles of
  masses <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., and speeds
  <i>v</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., respectively, is
  given by</p>

  <p align="center"><i>K</i> = (<i>m</i><sub>1</sub>/2)
  <i>v</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + (<i>m</i><sub>2</sub>/2)
  <i>v</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + ... .</p>
