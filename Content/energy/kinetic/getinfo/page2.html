    <p>3.  The expressions for the <i>kinetic energy of a rigid body</i>
    can be derived from Definition 2 of the kinetic energy of a system
    of particles above, by thinking of the rigid body as a collection of
    particles moving in unison.</p>

    <p>One must distinguish between pure <i>translational</i> motion, in
    which all parts of the rigid body at any given instant have the same
    velocity and the body is not rotating, and pure <i>rotational</i>
    motion, in which the body is rotating around some fixed axis.  There
    can also be a combination of these two types of motion.  The most
    general kind of rotational motion in which the body is wobbling,
    i.e., in which the rotation axis changes orientation, will not be
    considered here.</p>


    <p>(a) <u>Pure translational motion of a rigid body</u>.</p>

    <blockquote>If the body has speed <i>V</i> (in this case all parts
    of the body will have the same speed <i>V</i>) and mass <i>M</i>,
    the kinetic energy of the rigid body is given by</p>

    <p align="center"><i>K</i> = (<i>M</i>/2) <i>V</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>(b) <u>Pure rotational motion of a rigid body</u>.</p>  

    <p align="center"><img src="KineticEnergy4.gif"></p>

    <blockquote>If the body is rotating around a fixed axis with angular
    speed <font face="symbol">w</font> and has a moment of inertia about
    that axis equal to <font face="symbol">I</font>, its kinetic energy
    <i>K</i> is given by

    <p align="center"><i>K</i> = (<font face="symbol">I</font>/2)
    <font face="symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup>.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>(c) <u>Combined rotational and translational motion of a rigid
    body</u>.</p>

    <p align="center"><img src="KineticEnergy5.gif"></p>

    <blockquote>The most general motion of a rigid body that is not
    'wobbling' includes both translational motion and rotational motion
    about an axis of fixed orientation.  Any such motion can be thought
    of as a translation of the center of mass of the body and a rotation
    around an axis through the center of mass.

    <p>If, at a given instant, the center of mass moves with speed
    <i>V</i> and the body rotates about the center of mass with angular
    velocity <font face="symbol">w</font>, and the body's mass is
    <i>M</i> and its moment of inertia about the rotation axis through
    the center of mass equal to <font face="symbol">I</font>, the body's
    total kinetic energy is the sum of the translational kinetic energy
    of the center of mass and the body's rotational kinetic energy
    around the center of mass,</p>

    <p align="center"><i>K</i> = (<i>M</i>/2) <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> +
    (<font face="symbol">I</font>/2) <font
    face="symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup>.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p><u>Comment</u>.  The center of mass is the only point fixed
    relative to the body allowing a general decomposition of the kinetic
    energy into translational and rotational parts as in the preceding
    expression.</p>

    <p>Go to Page 3 for a generalization of this last expression to the
    case of a system of particles of changing shape.</p>
