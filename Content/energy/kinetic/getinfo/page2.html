  <div class="title">Kinetic Energy</div>


<p>3.  The expressions for the <i>kinetic energy of a rigid body</i>
  can be derived from Definition 2 of the kinetic energy of a system
  of particles above, by thinking of the rigid body as a collection of
  particles moving in unison.</p>

  <p>One must distinguish between pure <i>translational</i> motion, in
  which all parts of the rigid body at any given instant have the same
  velocity and the body is not rotating, and pure <i>rotational</i>
  motion, in which the body is rotating around some fixed axis.  There
  can also be a combination of these two types of motion.  The most
  general kind of rotational motion in which the body is wobbling,
  i.e., in which the rotation axis changes orientation, will not be
  considered here.</p>


  <p>(a) <u>Pure translational motion of a rigid body</u>.</p>

  <blockquote>If the body has speed <i>V</i> (in this case all parts
  of the body will have the same speed <i>V</i>) and mass <i>M</i>,
  the kinetic energy of the rigid body is given by</p>

  <p align="center"><i>K</i> = (<i>M</i>/2) <i>V</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>(b) <u>Pure rotational motion of a rigid body</u>.</p>  

  <p align="center"><img src="KineticEnergy4.gif"></p>

  <blockquote>If the body is rotating around a fixed axis with angular
  speed <font face="symbol">w</font> and has a moment of inertia about
  that axis equal to <font face="symbol">I</font>, its kinetic energy
  <i>K</i> is given by

  <p align="center"><i>K</i> = (<font face="symbol">I</font>/2)
  <font face="symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup>.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>(c) <u>Combined rotational and translational motion of a rigid
  body</u>.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="KineticEnergy5.gif"></p>

  <blockquote>The most general motion of a rigid body that is not
  'wobbling' includes both translational motion and rotational motion
  about an axis of fixed orientation.  Any such motion can be thought
  of as a translation of the center of mass of the body and a rotation
  around an axis through the center of mass.

  <p>If, at a given instant, the center of mass moves with speed
  <i>V</i> and the body rotates about the center of mass with angular
  velocity <font face="symbol">w</font>, and the body's mass is
  <i>M</i> and its moment of inertia about the rotation axis through
  the center of mass equal to <font face="symbol">I</font>, the body's
  total kinetic energy is the sum of the translational kinetic energy
  of the center of mass and the body's rotational kinetic energy
  around the center of mass,</p>

  <p align="center"><i>K</i> = (<i>M</i>/2) <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> +
  (<font face="symbol">I</font>/2) <font
  face="symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup>.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><u>Comment</u>.  The center of mass is the only point fixed
  relative to the body allowing a general decomposition of the kinetic
  energy into translational and rotational parts as in the preceding
  expression.</p>

  <p>Go to Page 3 for a generalization of this last expression to the
  case of a system of particles of changing shape.</p>
