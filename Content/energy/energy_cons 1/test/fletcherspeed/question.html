  <div class="title">Speed in Fletcher's Trolley</div>

  <p align="center"><img src="fletcherbare.jpg"></p>

  <p>The apparatus shown above is known as Fletcher's Trolley.  The
  apparatus is assumed to be without dissipative friction, and it is
  assumed that the string connecting the two blocks cannot stretch.
  The pulley and the string are assumed to be massless.  The masses of
  the blocks are <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> = 0.60 kg and
  <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> = 0.40 kg.  For the magnitude of the
  acceleration due to gravity, take the value <i>g</i> = 9.8
  m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>

  <p>The blocks are released from rest when block 2 is at elevation
  <i>h</i> = 3.0 m.  The snapshot above is taken at a later instant
  when block 2 is at <i>h</i> = 0.5 m while moving downward.</p> 

  <p>Use conservation of mechanical energy to find the speed of block
  1 at <i>h</i> = 0.5 m.  Submit your answer below in m/s.</p>
