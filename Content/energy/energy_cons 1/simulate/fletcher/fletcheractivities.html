  <div class="title">Energy Conservation in Fletcher's Trolley</div>
  <div class="title">Activities</div>

  <p><b>Preparation</b>: Energy/Energy Conserv'n/Explain It/Fletcher's
  Trolley.</p>

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>. Set block 2 to some initial height and the
  platform below block 2 to some final height.  Set the masses of the
  two blocks.  Then allow block 2 to drop from rest from the initial
  height to the platform.</P> 

  <p>The system is frictionless.</p>

  <p>Predict how the total mechanical energy <i>E</i> of the system
  and the potential energy and the kinetic energies will vary during
  the motion of the blocks, and then observe what happens in the
  simulation.</p>

  <p>Repeat this with different masses for the blocks, and also with a
  massive pulley.</p>

  <p><b>Exercise 2</b>. Carry out the following calculations.</P>     
                                                                        
  <p>1. Using energy conservation, and the values of the masses of the
  blocks and the vertical displacement of block 2, predict the speed
  of block 2 just before the block hits the platform.  Compare your
  value with that shown by the applet.</p>
                                                               
  <p>2. From the final speed found in Part 1, and the masses of the
  blocks and the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity,
  determine the magnitude of the acceleration of the two
  blocks. Compare your value with that shown by the applet.</p>
                                                                                                    
  <p>Repeat Parts 1 and 2 with a massive pulley.  The moment of
  inertia of the pulley and the radius of the pulley are indicated on
  the pulley slider.</p>
