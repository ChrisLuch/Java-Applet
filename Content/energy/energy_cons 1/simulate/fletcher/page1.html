    <div class="title">Energy Conservation in Fletcher's Trolley</div>

    <p><b>Preparation</b>: Energy/Energy Conserv'n/Explain It/Fletcher's
    Trolley.</p>

    <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates a Fletcher's Trolley apparatus (a
    horizontally moving block connected via a pulley to a vertically
    moving block).  The kinetic energies of the two blocks and of the
    pulley and the potential energy of the system are represented in bar
    form showing total energy conservation.

    <p>Detailed information on the applet and two lessons related to the
    applet are available under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
