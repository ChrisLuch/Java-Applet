 <div class="title">Energy Conservation in a System Consisting of a
 Charged Particle and the Uniform Electric Field in a Parallel-Plate
 Capacitor</div>

 <p>The Applet on Page 2 simulates the motion of a charged particle in
 the uniform electric field between the plates of an infinitely
 extended parallel-plate capacitor.  It displays the electric force
 acting on the particle and the potential, kinetic, and total energies
 of the system consisting of the particle and the field.

 <p>Detailed information on how to use the applet and a guided tour
 (ShowMe) of the applet in the form of Exercises to be done with the
 applet are available under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.

 <p>When working with the applet, open "Activities" under Related
 Items for suggestions on what to investigate with the applet.
