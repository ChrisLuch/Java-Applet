<p><b><center>What is the Acceleration?</center></b>  

<p>Now let us determine the acceleration theoretically, using energy
conservation.

<p>First, it is a good idea to become a bit familiar with the system.
You can change the angles of the inclines (by dragging their 'feet')
and the masses of the blocks.  Do this for various settings and
observe the accelerations.

<p>Also observe the potential energies PE1 and PE2 of the pairs
block-1/earth and block-2/earth, respectively.
