<div class="title">Energy Conservation</div>

<p>
  <b>Principle of Energy Conservation</b>:
</p>
<blockquote>
  It is possible to define an energy for every system such that the
  energy of the system is conserved if the system is isolated and that
  the energy of the system plus its environment is conserved if there
  is energy transfer between the system and its environment. In more
  detail, this means the following.  <br> <br> For different kinds of
  systems, energy has to be defined differently, e.g., as mechanical,
  electric, or thermal energy.  One kind of energy can be transformed
  into another kind, and energy can be transferred from one system to
  another.  The <i>principle of energy conservation</i> says that
  energy can be defined in such a way that the energy of an isolated
  system is conserved while processes may be occurring inside the
  system in which energy of one kind is transformed into energy of
  another kind and that the total energy of a system and its
  environment is conserved in processes involving energy transfer
  between the system and its environment.  </blockquote>
<p>
  <b>Example</b>. Imagine a system consisting of two stars revolving
  around each other, a so-called <i>binary star system</i>.  Let us
  assume this to be an isolated system without any external forces
  acting on it.  In response to the gravitational forces that the
  stars exert on each other (internal forces), the stars in general
  will be following elliptical paths and at certain times will be
  getting closer to each other and at other times will be getting
  farther away from each other.  When they are getting closer to each
  other, they are getting faster and their kinetic energies increase.
  When they are moving farther away from each other, the kinetic
  energies of the stars decrease.
</p>
<p>
  If we defined the total energy of the binary star system to be the
  sum of the kinetic energies of the two stars, this energy would
  <b>not</b> be conserved.  However, the principle of energy
  conservation tells us that it must be possible to define an energy
  for this system that <b>is</b> conserved.  One can define a
  potential energy for the system so that the sum of the kinetic and
  potential energy is conserved.  When the kinetic energy of
  the system increases, the potential energy decreases, and vice
  versa, such that the sum of the two remains unchanged.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Terminology</b>. Once appropriate energies have been defined for
  all systems of interest, one speaks of the <b>law of energy
  conservation</b>.  This law consists of the principle of energy
  conservation combined with appropriate energy expressions.
</p>
<p>
  The distinction between the terms <i>principle of energy
  conservation</i> and <i>law of energy conservation</i> that is made
  here is a slight one.  The law of energy conservation is what one
  usually deals with in applications.
