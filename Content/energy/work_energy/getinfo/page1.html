<div class="title">Work-Energy Theorem</div>

<p>The work-energy theorem must be distinguished from the work-kinetic
energy theorem.  What adds to the confusion is that the latter is
often referred to as the work-energy theorem.  In MAP, the two names
are used to distinguish between two different theorems.

<p>The work-energy theorem says that

<p><blockquote>the total work done on a mechanical system during a
certain time interval by all non-conservative forces acting on the
system is equal to the change in the system's mechanical energy during
that time interval.</blockquote>

<p><u>Comment 1</u>.  The mechanical energy of a system is the sum of
its kinetic energy and its potential energy.

<p><u>Comment 2</u>.  All <b>external</b> conservative forces doing
work on the system are to be included among the non-conservative
forces in this theorem, because no potential energy is associated with
external conservative forces.

<p>The non-conservative forces acting on the system may be either
external or internal forces.

<p><b>Example</b>.  Let the system consist of a block, a fixed
incline, and the earth supporting the incline.  There is friction
between the block and the incline, and the block can slide on the
incline.  An applied force is acting on the block.  

<p>The applied force acting on the block and the friction forces
acting on the block and the incline are the non-conservative forces
acting on the system.  The applied force is an external
non-conservative force and the friction forces are internal
non-conservative forces.

<p>The gravitational force acting on the block is an internal
conservative force of the system and is taken into consideration
through the gravitational potential energy of the block-earth pair of
bodies.  The gravitational force exerted by the block on the earth
does a negligible amount of work which will be neglected.

<p>The work-kinetic energy theorem implies that during a given time
interval the sum of the work done by the applied force on the block,
<i>W<sub>app</sub></i>, and the work done by the friction force on the
block, <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i>, is equal to the change in the block's
mechanical energy, <font face="symbol">D</font><i>E</i>.  In symbols,

<p align="center"><i>W<sub>app</sub></i> + <i>W<sub>fric</sub></i> =
<font face="symbol">D</font><i>E</i>, <img src="small.gif" height="1"
width="20"> where <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="10"> <i>E</i>
= <i>KE</i> + <i>PE</i>.</p>

<p>The friction force acting on the incline does no work because the
incline is not moving.  Therefore this work does not contribute to the
left-hand side of the equation above.
