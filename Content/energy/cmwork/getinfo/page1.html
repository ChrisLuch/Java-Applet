      <b>CM-Work Compared To Work</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Textbooks usually do not distinguish between CM-work (read:
      center-of-mass work) and work and refer to both concepts as
      "work". This is unfortunate because it can lead to confusion.
      The <i>work done by a force</i> is defined as the force times
      the displacement of the point at which the force is acting while
      the <i>CM-work done by a force</i> is defined as the force times
      the displacement of the center of mass (CM) of the object or
      system on which the force is acting. (In both definitions,
      "times" denotes the scalar product.) The work and CM-work done
      by a given force during a given time interval are different in
      general because the displacements involved in the two kinds of
      work can be different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from the difference in the displacements in the defintions
      of work and CM-work, there is nothing to distinguish the two
      concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term "CM-work" is not a standard term, but is used in MAP
      as a reminder that CM-work is related to the displacement of
      the center of mass (CM). In the literature, the term
      "pseudowork" has also been used for CM-work.

      <b>CM-Work Done By A Constant Force: One Dimension</b>
    </p>

      <u>Example 1</u>.

    <p>
      <img src="Work0.gif" alt="Displacement of Block">

      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
	 <p>
      Figure 1 shows a rigid block that undergoes a displacement
      without rotation of the block while a force <img src="F.gif"
      alt="vector F" align="bottom"> is acting on the block.  In this
      case, the displacement <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d"
      align="bottom"> of the point at which the force is acting is
      also the displacement of the CM of the block. Therefore the
      CM-work done on the block by the force is equal to the work done
      on the block and both are equal to

      <i>W<sub>CM</sub></i> = <i>W</i> = <i>Fd</i>. <img src=
      "small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (1)
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Example 2</u>. Figure 2 below shows a skater pushing off a
      wall. The wall exerts a force <img src="F.gif" align=
      "bottom"> on the skater where the wall is in contact with the
      skater's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figure 2 shows the skater initially and at later instant and the
      displacement <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d"
      align="bottom"><sub>CM</sub> of the CM of the skater between the
      two instants.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="SkaterAtWall.gif" alt="Skater Pushing Off Wall">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The CM-work done by the wall on the skater is equal to
      <i>Fd<sub>CM</sub></i>, which is clearly non-zero. In contrast,
      the work done by the wall on the skater is zero because the
      displacement of the point at which the force <img src="F.gif"
      alt="vector F" align="bottom"> is acting, i.e., the displacement
      of the skater's hand, is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since no work is being done on the skater, no energy is being
      transferred to the skater. The kinetic energy acquired by the
      skater while pushing off the wall comes from an internal
      transformation of chemical energy in the skater's muscles into
      kinetic energy. This examples illustrates that CM-work, unlike
      work, is not a tranfer of energy. CM-work is a formal construct
      that only "looks" like work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CM-Work: Generalities</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Like work, CM-work is a scalar quantity. The SI-unit of
      CM-work, like that of work, is the joule (J).
    </p>
    <p>
      Example 2 illustrates that the CM-work done on a system by an
      external force is not a transfer of energy to the system. This
      is why CM-work is also called pseudowork. Nevertheless, the
      CM-work done on a system by the net external force acting on
      the system is equal to the change in the system's translational
      kinetic energy.  This kinetic energy is equal to <i>M</i>/2
      <i>V</i><sup>2</sup>, where <i>M</i> is the mass of the system
      and <i>V</i> the speed of the CM of the system.  For details see
      Energy/CM-Work Theorem.
