      <b>CM-Work Done By A Constant Force: Definition In One, Two,
      Or Three Dimensions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      As stated on Page 1, the definition of CM-work
      <i>W<sub>CM</sub></i> done by a force <img src="F.gif"
         alt="vector F" align="bottom"> is analogous to that of
         work. We just need to substitute the displacement
         <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align=
         "bottom"><sub>CM</sub> of the CM for the displacement
         <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align="bottom"> of the
         point at which the force is acting. Thus, for a constant
         force,

      <i>W<sub>CM</sub></i> = <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"

         "bottom"><img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align=
         "bottom"><sub>CM</sub> = <i>Fd<sub>CM</sub> cos</i>
         <font face="symbol">q</font>
    </p>
    <p>
      where <i>d<sub>CM</sub></i> is the magnitude of <img src=
      "d.gif" align="bottom"><sub>CM</sub> and <font face=
      "symbol">q</font> is the angle between the force and
      displacement vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scalar product can be evaluated in terms of the scalar
      components of the vectors. In two dimensions this becomes

      <i>W<sub>CM</sub></i> = <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
              align="bottom"><img src="dot.gif" alt="dot" align=
              "bottom"><img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align=
              "bottom"><sub>CM</sub> = <i>F<sub>x</sub>

    <p>
      In three dimensions, the term <i>F<sub>z</sub>
      d<sub>CM,z</sub></i> needs to be added on the right-hand
      side. For motions in one dimension along an <i>x</i>-axis,
      only the term <i>F<sub>x</sub> d<sub>CM,x</sub></i> is needed
      on the right-hand side.

      <u>Example</u>. Figure 1 below shows a five-sided object at
      the initial and final moments of a time interval for which we
      want to calculate the CM-work done on the object. The figure
      shows a constant force <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
         align="bottom">, the path of the point on which the force
         is acting, the displacement <img src="d.gif" alt=
         "vector d" align="bottom"> of this point, and the
         displacement <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align=
         "bottom"><sub>CM</sub> of the CM. The latter is shown in
         green.

    <p>
      As the figure illustrates, the displacement of the CM is
      different from the displacement of the point at which the
      force is acting. Therefore, the CM-work done by the force
      <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"> is different
      from the work in this case.

      <u>Comment</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"> cannot be the
      only force that is acting on the object. (The other forces are
      not shown.) The object could not be moving along the stippled
      path if <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align= "bottom"> were
      the only force. (Why not?) The fact that other forces are
      present has no bearing on how the CM-work done by just <img
      src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"> is calculated. We
      could calculate the CM-work done by the other forces in the same
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we add the amounts of CM-work done by all individual
      forces, we get what is called the <i>net CM-work</i> done on
      the object.

      <b>CM-Work Done By A Variable Force</b>
	 </p>
    <p>
      If a force acting on an object or system is varying during some
      time interval, the CM-work done by the force during this time
      interval on the object or system is the sum of all the
      infinitesimal amounts <i>dW<sub>CM</sub></i> of CM-work done
      during the infinitesimal intervals that make up the finite
      interval.  (A sum of infinitesimals is called an integral.) The
      path taken by the CM will in general be curved.  The
      infinitesimal amounts of work
      <i>dW<sub>CM</sub></i> need to be calculated for the
      infinitesimal displacements of the CM that make up this curved
      path.

      The infinitesimal CM-work <i>dW<sub>CM</sub></i> done by a
      variable force <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom">
      on an object or system during an infinitesimal time interval
      while the object's or system's CM undergoes the infinitesimal
      displacement <i>d</i><img src="R.gif" alt="vector R"
      align="bottom"> is defined by
