<p><b>General Properties of Potential Energy</b></p>

<p>Potential energy is an energy of interaction between objects.  For
one object alone, there is no potential energy.  There need to be at
least two objects before there can be an interaction between objects
and an associated potential energy.  The second "object" can be a
field, e.g., a gravitational field.  Let us consider the case of just
two interacting objects.</p>

<p>The potential energy of interaction between two objects depends on
the separation of the two objects.  In the most important cases, the
potential energy depends only on the magnitude of the separation,
although, in principle, a potential energy could also depend on the
direction of the separation.</p>

<p>The two most fundamental types of interaction with which a
potential energy can be associated are the gravitational and the
electrostatic interactions.  These two cases will now be considered on
Pages 2 and 3.  The general definition of potential energy underlying
all of these will be given on Page 4.</p>
