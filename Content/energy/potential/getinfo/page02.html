<div class="title">Potential Energy due to Gravitational Interaction</div>

<p><b>Object near the earth's surface</b>. Let the two objects
interacting gravitationally be the earth and a second object of mass
<i>m</i> near the earth's surface.  Let the direction pointing
vertically upward be the <i>y</i>-direction, and let the origin
<i>y</i> = 0 of the <i>y</i>-axis be somewhere near the earth's
surface.  It does not matter where exactly we put <i>y</i> = 0.  (See
below about additive constant in the potential energy.)</p>

<p>The gravitational potential energy <i>PE</i> of the earth/object
pair if the object is near the earth's surface is then equal to</p>

<div class="equation"><i>PE</i> = <i>mgy</i> + const  <spacer
type="horizontal" size="40">(1)</div>

<p>where <i>y</i> is the <i>y</i>-coordinate of the object's position
and <i>g</i> is the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity at
the earth's surface.</p>

<p><u>Comments</u></p>

<ol>

<li>The added constant in Expression (1) can be chosen to have any
value.  Often it is convenient to set it equal to zero.  Choosing the
origin of the <i>y</i>-axis to be higher or lower is equivalent to
choosing a different value for this constant.</li>

<p>

<li>Expression (1) depends on <b>both</b> objects, the earth and the
second object: </li>

<ul>

<p><li>the value of <i>g</i> depends on the mass <i>M</i> of
the earth and the distance <i>r</i> between the object of mass
<i>m</i> and the center of the earth</li> 

<li>the factor <i>m</i> obviously relates to the second object</li>

<li><i>y</i> is a measure of the separation between the earth and the
second object</li>

</ul>

<p>This illustrates that the potential energy (1) belongs to
<b>both</b> the earth and the second object.</p>

<p>

<li>It is customary to refer to Expression (1) as the "potential
energy of the object of mass <i>m</i>" and not as the "potential
energy of the earth/object pair".  This custom is only a convenience
and does not express the correct understanding of Expression (1).</li>

<p>

<li>Expression (1) is an <b>approximate</b> expression for the
potential energy.  It is true only as long as one can ignore the
variation of <i>g</i> with elevation.  (<i>g</i> decreases as one goes
higher, but very little over a distance of a few hundred meters.)  If
the object is moved to substantial distances from the surface of the
earth, say, a few hundred kilometers or more, Expression (1) must be
replaced by Expression (2) below.</li>

<p>

<li>Expression (1) implies that the potential energy does not change
when one moves the object of mass <i>m</i> horizontally.  <i>PE</i>
depends only on the vertical displacement of the object from the
earth's surface.</li>

<p>

<li>The SI-unit of potential energy is the same as that for any
energy, namely, the joule (J).</li>

<p>

<li>Taking the constant in Expression (1) equal to zero, the graph of
<i>PE</i> vs. <i>y</i> looks as follows:</li>

</ol>

<p><b>Object at an arbitrary distance from the earth's surface</b>.
In this case, the potential energy of the object/earth pair is given
by</p>

<div class="equation"><i>PE</i>(<i>r</i>) = - <i>GMm</i>/<i>r</i>,
<spacer type="horizontal" size="10"><i>r</i> > <i>R</i> <spacer
type="horizontal" size="40">(2)</div>

<p>where <i>r</i> is the object's distance from the center of the
earth, <i>G</i> is the universal gravitational constant, <i>M</i> is
the mass of the earth, and <i>m</i> the mass of the object.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows how <i>PE</i> varies with <i>r</i> for
<i>r</i> > <i>R</i> where <i>R</i> is the radius of the earth.</p>

<p><u>Comments</u>

<p>

<ol>

<li>Expression (2) for the potential energy and the corresponding
Graph 2 look very different from Expression (1) and its Graph 1.  How
come? Are they not both supposed to give the potential energy of the
earth/object pair?

<p>Yes, they are.  Let's compare them in detail.  First of all, they
give different values for <i>PE</i> at <i>r</i> = <i>R</i>.  If const
= 0 in Expression (1), then this expression gives the value 0 at
<i>r</i> = <i>R</i> while Expression (2) gives the value
-<i>GMm</i>/<i>R</i>. A constant can always be added to the potential
energy without affecting anything that is observable experimentally.
Only <b>changes</b> in the potential energy are observable, and adding
a constant term to a potential energy does not affect by how much the
potential energy changes as one goes from one point to another.  Thus,
let us add the constant <i>GMm</i>/<i>R</i> to Expression (2).  This
modifies Expression (2) to</p>

<p>

<div class="equation"><i>PE</i>(<i>r</i>) = - <i>GMm</i>/<i>r</i> +
<i>GMm</i>/<i>R</i>, <spacer type="horizontal" size="10"><i>r</i> >
<i>R</i> <spacer type="horizontal" size="40"> (3)</div>

<p>Expression (3) for <i>PE</i> is represented by the blue curve in
Graph 3 below.  The blue curve in Graph 3 is the same as the blue
curve in Graph 2, but shifted upward by the constant amount
<i>GMm</i>/<i>R</i>.

<p><center><img SRC="GenPotEn2.gif"></center>

<p><center><b>Graph 3</b></center>

<p>Now let us compare Expression (3) and Graph 3 to Expression (1) and
Graph 1.  Both give the same value 0 for <i>r</i> = <i>R</i>, but
Graph 3 is curved while Graph 1 is a straight line.  The straight line
in Graph 1 is identical with the purple straight line in Graph 3.
This line is the tangent to the blue curve at <i>r</i> = <i>R</i>.
This straight line <b>approximates</b> the curve in the vicinity of
<i>r</i> = <i>R</i>, i.e., near the earth's surface.  The blue curve
represents the potential energy exactly, for all <i>r</i> > <i>R</i>,
while the purple straight line is the linear approximation to this
curve valid only near <i>r</i> = <i>R</i>.  Similarly, Expressions (2)
or (3) are exact expressions for the potential energy, valid for all
<i>r</i> > <i>R</i>, while Expression (1) is an approximation that is
valid only near <i>r</i> = <i>R</i>.</li>

<p>

<li>Expressions (2) and (3) are exact if one assumes the earth to be a
perfect sphere with a uniform mass distribution.  Under these
assumptions, for <i>r</i> > <i>R</i>, the earth acts gravitationally
as if all of its mass were concentrated at its center.  In reality,
the earth has a somewhat larger radius at the equator than at the
poles and its mass distribution is not entirely uniform either.  Thus,
the true potential energy contains small correction terms to
Expressions (2) and (3).</li>

<p>

<li>For <i>r</i> < <i>R</i>, i.e., if the object is inside the earth,
Expressions (2) and (3) no longer apply, because it is not true for
<i>r</i> < <i>R</i> that the earth acts as if <b>all</b> of its mass
were located at the earth's center.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>Interaction between two point particles</b>.  Suppose two point
particles of masses <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> a
distance <i>r</i> apart are interacting gravitationally.  The
potential energy due to this interaction is given by</p>

<i>Gm<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub></i>/<i>r</i>, <i>r</i> > 0 <spacer

<p>This equation is valid for all <i>r</i> > 0.  The constant <i>G</i>
is the universal gravitational constant equal to </p>
