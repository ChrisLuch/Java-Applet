<div class="title">Potential Energy due to Electrostatic Interaction</div>

<p><b>Charged particle in uniform electric field</b>.  Suppose a point
particle of charge <i>q</i> is placed in a uniform static electric
field of magnitude <i>E</i> pointing in the negative
<i>y</i>-direction.  This field is due to a distribution of fixed
source charges, and the force experienced by the given point particle
in the electric field is the result of the interaction of the particle
with all of these source charges.  The field concept summarizes the
effect of the individual interactions between the particle and the
source charges.</p>

<p>If the particle's charge <i>q</i> is positive, the given situation
is analogous to that on Page 2 where a particle of mass <i>m</i> is in
the uniform gravitational field of magnitude <i>g</i> near the surface
of the earth.  In both cases, the force points in the direction of the
field, which is in the negative <i>y</i>-direction in both cases.</p>

<p>Therefore, the expression for the electric potential energy of the
charged particle is analogous to Expression (1) on Page 2 for the
gravitational potential energy.  The gravitational force acting on the
object on Page 2 has magnitude <i>mg</i> and the electric force on the
charged particle has magnitude <i>qE</i>.  Thus, replacing <i>mg</i>
by <i>qE</i> in Expression (1) from Page 2 gives us the electric
potential energy of the charged particle as</p>

<div class="equation"><i>PE</i> = <i>qEy</i> + const <spacer
type="horizontal" size="40">(1)</div>

<p>where <i>y</i> is the <i>y</i>-coordinate of the particle's
position.</p>

<p>This expression can be generalized to one that applies to two
situations, those in which the electric field points either in the
negative or positive <i>y</i>-direction.  We only need to replace the
magnitude <i>E</i> of the field by the <b>negative</b> of the
<i>y</i>-component <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> of the field.  Thus,</p>

<div class="equation"><i>PE</i> = -<i>qE<sub>y</sub>y</i> + const<spacer
type="horizontal" size="40">(2)</div>

<p>is the more general expression for the potential energy of the
particle.</p>
 
<p>One needs the <b>negative</b> of the <i>y</i>-component because
<i>E<sub>y</sub></i> = -<i>E</i> when the field is pointing in the
negative <i>y</i>-direction, as it is in Equation (1).  The minus sign
in Equation (2) ensures that both Equations (1) and (2) give the same
value for <i>PE</i> when the field is in the negative
<i>y</i>-direction.</p>

<p>When the electric field points in the positive <i>y</i>-direction,
Expression (1) is no longer valid, but Expression (2) still is.  The
reason is that <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> changes sign when the field
reverses direction so that the potential energy as given by Equation
(2) changes sign as well, except for the unimportant added constant.
The potential energy must change sign when the field and therefore the
force on the given particle reverse direction.</p>

<p>One difference between the electric and gravitational cases is that
electric charge can be either positive or negative while mass is never
negative.  When the charge of the particle changes sign, the electric
force acting on the particle reverses so that the potential energy
should again change sign.  Note that Expression (2) does that, except
for the unimportant added constant.  Thus, Expression (2) gives the
potential energy of a point particle in an electric field that points
in the positive or negative <i>y</i>-direction, no matter what the
sign of the charge is.</p>

<p>Of course, if the electric field is either in the <i>x</i> or
<i>z</i> directions, <i>y</i> and <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> in Expression
(2) must be replaced by <i>x</i> and <i>E<sub>x</sub></i> or <i>z</i>
and <i>E<sub>z</sub></i>, respectively.
 
<p><b>Interaction between two charged point particles</b>.  Suppose we
have two point particles carrying charges <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and
<i>q<sub>2</sub></i> that are a distance <i>r</i> apart.  The
particles are interacting electrostatically, i.e., via the Coulomb
interaction.  The potential energy due to this interaction is given
by</p>

<div class="equation"><i>PE</i>(<i>r</i>) =
<i>kq<sub>1</sub>q<sub>2</sub></i>/<i>r</i>, <i>r</i> > 0 <spacer
type="horizontal" size="40">(3)</div>

<p>where <i>k</i> is the constant in Coulomb's force law,</p>

<div class="equation"><i>k</i> = 8.99x10<sup>9</sup> N m<sup>2</sup>
C<sup>-2</sup> .<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">(4)</div>

<p><u>Comments</u>

<p>

<ol>

<li>Equation (3) is analogous to Equation (4) on Page 2 for the
potential energy of two gravitationally interacting point particles.</li>

<p>

<li>Expression (3) above and Expression (4) on Page 2 differ by an
overall sign.  The reason for this difference is that when both
particles have positive charge they <b>repel</b> each other electrostatically
while two particles with (necessarily) positive masses <b>attract</b> each
other gravitationally.</p>

<p>When the two charges have opposite sign, the particles attract each
other electrostatically and Expression (3) above gives a negative
value for the electric potential energy, just like Expression (4) on
Page 2 which always gives a negative value for the gravitational potential
energy.</li>
