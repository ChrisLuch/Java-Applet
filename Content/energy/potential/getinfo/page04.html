<div class="title">General Definition of Potential Energy</div>

<p>

<ol>

<li>Like all forms of energy, potential energy is a <b>scalar</b>
quantity.</li>

<p>

<li>Like all forms of energy, potential energy has as its SI-unit the
joule (J).</li>

<p>

<li>Potential energy is a quantity that is associated with the
interaction between objects.  A single object by itself does not have
a potential energy.  (Also please note that only certain kinds of
interaction have potential energies associated with them.  Others
cannot be characterized this way.  See Item 6 below.)

<p>One often encounters situations in which a single object is located
in either a fixed gravitational or electrostatic field. One can define
the potential energy of the particle in such a field. What does this
mean in view of the statement that potential energy is associated with
the interaction between objects?  A field is always due to 'sources',
i.e., other particles, and the field concept is simply a convenient
way of summarizing the interaction between the given particle and the
source particles.  Thus, the 'potential energy of the particle in the
field' is really the potential energy of interaction between the
particle and the source particles.  At least this is the way one
conceptualizes things in particle mechanics.  (In field theory one
looks at things differently.)</li>

<p>

<li>Let us define the potential energy of a particle in a fixed
gravitational or electrostatic field.  The field will exert a force on
the particle.  Suppose the particle moves from point A to point B.
Then this force will do an amount of work <i>W<sub>A to B</sub></i> on
the particle. One defines the <b>change</b> <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> in the particle's potential energy, as
the particle moves from A to B, by

<p>

<div class="equation"><font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> =
<i>PE<sub>B</sub></i> - <i>PE<sub>A</sub></i> = - <i>W<sub>A to
B</sub></i> .<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">(1)</div></li>

<p>

<li>Equation (1) defines only the <b>change</b> in the potential
energy, <b>not</b> the potential energy at a given point.  Equation
(1) gives for the potential energy at point B the expression

<p>

<div class="equation"><i>PE<sub>B</sub></i> = - <i>W<sub>A to B</sub></i> +
<i>PE<sub>A</sub></i> .<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">(2)</div>

<p>One can set the potential energy when the particle is at a given
point A equal to some arbitrary value.  Then the potential energy at
any other point B is defined <b>uniquely</b> by Expression (2).</li>

<p>

<li>The forces exerted by a gravitational or electrostatic field on a
particle have the special property that the work done by such a force
on the particle does not depend on the path taken by the particle, as
the particle moves from any point A to any point B.  Such forces are
called <i>conservative</i> forces.  

<p>One can define a potential energy only for conservative forces,
because if <i>W<sub>A to B</sub></i> depends on the path connnecting A
to B then this work and <i>PE<sub>B</sub></i>, as given by Expression
(2), do not have unique values.  The potential energy is, however,
supposed to have a unique value at a given point, except for the
arbitrary additive constant.

<p>An example of a force that is not conservative is friction.</li>

<p>

<li>If a particle is interacting with a second much larger object that
is so large that it can be assumed to remain at rest while the
particles are interacting, then the potential energy of this two-body
system can be defined as above.  The large object creates a force
field in which the small object moves.  (Example: ball near the
surface of the earth.)  The work done on the small object by this
force field is the negative change of the potential energy of the
two-body system.  (This is assuming the force is conservative.
Otherwise, one does not define a potential energy.)</li>

<p>

<li>If two particles are interacting whose masses are comparable, so
that both particles' motions will be affected by the interaction
between the particles, then the potential energy change of this
two-particle system is still defined by Equation (1).  However, now A
denotes not only the initial position of one of the particles, but the
initial positions of both particles.  Similarly, B now denotes the
final positions of both particles, and <i>W<sub>A to B</sub></i> the
work done on <b>both</b> particles as they move from A to B.  This
work is the sum of the work done on Particle 1, by the force exerted
on this particle by Particle 2, plus the work done on Particle 2, by
the force exerted on this particle by Particle 1.</li>

<p>

<li>Because of the minus sign in Equation (1), the potential energy
increases in the direction that is opposite to the force of
interaction.  E.g., if a charged particle in an electric field has an
electric force acting on it that is in the negative
<i>y</i>-direction, then the electric potential energy increases in
the positive <i>y</i>-direction.

<p>Vice versa, the force exerted on a particle in a field points in
the direction from high to low potential energy; more exactly, in the
direction in which the potential energy decreases most rapidly.  (This
has significance in two or three dimensions.  In one dimension, there
can be only one direction in which the potential energy can
decrease.)</li>

</ol>

<p>The expressions for the potential energy on Pages 2 and 3 can all
be derived from Equation (1) if one substitutes the appropriate
forces.  When variable forces are involved, calculating the work
<i>W<sub>A to B</sub></i> requires working out an integral.</p>
