<div class="title">Activities on Potential Energy and Energy
Conservation in a Uniform Electric Field</div>

 <p>
   The following Activities are for the 'Charged Particle in
   Capacitor' applet.  Make sure you know how the applet functions by
   consulting Help and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's Help
   menu.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>ACTIVITY 1</b>.  The purpose of Activity 1 is to predict the
   kinetic energy of a charged particle upon impact of the particle on
   one of the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor after the particle
   has been released from rest at the other plate.  Any forces other
   than the electric force are ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
   RESET the applet.  Display the Data box.  Set the following
   parameters and the following initial conditions at <i>t</i> = 0 for
   the charged particle:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   electric field: <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> = -50 V/m;
  </li>
  <li>
   particle charge: <i>q</i> = 3 C;
  </li>
  <li>
   particle mass: <i>m</i> = 3.0 kg;
  </li>
  <li>
   drag the particle so that it touches the top plate;
  </li>
  <li>
   set the particle's velocity to 0.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
   With these settings, the direction of the electric field and of the
   electric force acting on the particle are downward.  Display the
   force vector to verify this.
 </p>
 <p>
   Make the following measurements with the applet:
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(a)</b> At <i>t</i> = 0, record
 </p>
	<ul>
     <li>the particle's <i>y</i>-coordinate (measured at the
     particle's center),</li>
	  <li>the force acting on the particle.</li>
   </ul>

 <p>
   <b>(b)</b> PLAY the motion until the particle hits the bottom
   plate.  At this point, record the particle's
 </p>
	<ul>
	  <li><i>y</i>-coordinate (measured at the particle's center),</li>
     <li>kinetic energy <i>KE</i>,</li>
	  <li>speed <i>v</i>.</li>
  </ul>

 <p>
   <u>Calculations</u>
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(a)</b> The particle's <i>y</i>-coordinate when the particle is
   at the top plate depends on the size of your applet window.  The
   taller the window, the more widely the plates are separated, and the
   larger the particle's <i>y</i>-coordinate at the top plate.
 </p>
 <p>
   For the following sample calculations, let us assume <i>y</i>(0) =
   185.0 m.
 </p>
 <p>
   The force <img src="../images/F_orange.gif" alt="vector F" align="top">
   acting on a charged particle of charge <i>q</i> in an electric
   field <img src="../images/E_orange.gif" alt="vector E" align="top"> is
   given by the expression
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <img src="../images/F_orange.gif" alt="vector F" align="top"> =
   <i>q</i><img src="../images/E_orange.gif" alt="vector E" align="top">.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="20">(1)
 </p>
 <p>
   For the values set above,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> = 0<img src="../images/small_orange.gif"
   alt="space" height="1" width="10">and<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="10"><i>F<sub>y</sub></i> = 3&times(-50) = -150 N.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(2)
 </p>
 <p>
   Compare Results (2) with the values given in the Data box.  Note
   that the <i>x</i>-component of the force is zero, which means that
   the force is parallel to the <i>y</i>-axis.  The minus sign in the
   value of <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> means the direction of the force is
   the same as that of the negative <i>y</i>-direction.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(b)</b> When the particle is at the bottom plate, it is at
   <i>y</i> = 15.0 m.  This is true independently of your window size.
 </p>
 <p>
   Since the particle is moving parallel to the <i>y</i>-axis, the
   work <i>W</i> done on the particle in moving from the top to the
   bottom plate involves only the change <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>y</i> in the <i>y</i>-component of the
   particle's displacement.  Thus, since the force is constant,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>W</i> = <i>F<sub>y</sub></i><font face="symbol">D</font><i>y</i>
   = (-150)&times;(15.0 - 185.0) = 25,500 J.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(3)
 </p>
 <p>
   By the work-kinetic energy theorem, the particle's kinetic energy
   <i>KE</i> should change by <i>W</i> when the particle is moving
   from the top to the bottom plate.  Therefore, since the particle's
   kinetic energy is zero at the top plate, at the bottom plate we
   have
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>KE<sub>bottom</sub></i> = <i>W</i> = 25,500 J.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(4)
 <p>
 <p>
   Equating Value (4) to the expression for the kinetic energy,
   <i>KE</i> = (<i>m</i>/2)<i>v</i><sup>2</sup>, and solving for
   <i>v</i>, gives for the speed of the particle when the particle
   reaches the bottom plate:
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>v<sub>bottom</sub></i> = <img src="../images/root16_orange.gif"
   alt="root" align="bottom">(2<i>KE</i>/<i>m</i>) = <img
   src="../images/root16_orange.gif" alt="root"
   align="bottom">(2&times;25,500/3) = 130.4 m/s.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(5)
 </p>
 <p>
   Repeat these calculations with the value of the displacement <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>y</i> that applies in your case, and
   compare the results with those given by the applet.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>ACTIVITY 2</b>.  The purpose of Activity 2 is to repeat the
   Experiment from Activity 1, but use potential energy and energy
   conservation to calculate the particle's kinetic energy upon impact
   on the bottom plate.
 </p>
 <p>
   <u>Explanation of Potential Energy</u>. The calculations in
   Activity 1 were based on a view point in which the particle is the
   system.  This system's energy is entirely kinetic energy.  The
   energy can be changed by work done on the system, which is energy
   transfered to the system from outside the system.
 </p>
 <p>
   Alternatively, one can consider a larger system, consisting of the
   particle and the electric field. For this larger system, it is
   possible to invent a potential energy.  This potential energy
   belongs to both the particle and the field, although, for brevity's
   sake, it is common to refer to it as the <i>electric potential
   energy of the particle</i>.  The other form of energy the system
   has is the particle's kinetic energy. 
 </p>
 <p>
   As the particle has kinetic energy, so does the electric field have
   energy.  However, since the electric field is assumed not to
   change, the field's energy does not change either.  Thus, the total
   energy of the particle-field system is equal to the sum of the
   electric potential energy and the kinetic energy of the particle
   plus some constant that is not important and that we will take
   equal to zero.
 </p>
 <p>
   Taking the particle and field to be our system, we can describe a
   change in the kinetic energy of the particle as a transformation of
   potential energy of the system into kinetic energy of the system
   such that the sum of kinetic and potential energy, the total energy
   of the system, is conserved.
 </p>
 <p>
   For this to be true, the potential energy must be defined so that
   the loss in potential energy is equal to the gain in kinetic
   energy, i.e.,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   -<font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> = <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(6)
 </p>
 <p>
   Since <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> is equal to the work
   <i>W</i> done by the field on the particle, the potential energy
   must be then defined so that
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   -<font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> = <i>W</i>.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(7)
 </p> 
 <p>
   Eq.(7) is the general definition of potential energy change.  Note
   that this way one obtains the <b>change</b> in potential energy.
   Definition (7) determines the potential energy up to an arbitrary
   additive constant in the potential energy which one can choose to
   have a convenient value.
 </p>
 <p>
   The work <i>W</i> is given by Eq.(3).  Using Eq.(1) to substitute
   for the force gives
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>W</i> = <i>F<sub>y</sub></i><font face="symbol">D</font><i>y</i>
   = <i>qE<sub>y</sub></i><font face="symbol">D</font><i>y</i><img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(8)
 </p>
 <p>
   Substituting this into Eq.(7) gives for the change in the potential
   energy of the particle in the electric field of the capacitor
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> = -<i>qE<sub>y</sub></i><font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>y</i>.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(9)
 </p> 
 <p>
   Let us denote the potential energy when the particle is at
   elevation <i>y</i> by <i>PE</i>(<i>y</i>).  With this notation,
   Eq.(9) can be written more explicitly as follows.
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>PE</i>(<i>y</i>) - <i>PE</i>(0) =
   -<i>qE<sub>y</sub></i>(<i>y</i> - 0).<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(10)
 </p>
 <p>
   Taking <i>PE</i>(0) = 0, which we are free to do, Eq.(10) reduces to
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>PE</i>(<i>y</i>) = -<i>qE<sub>y</sub></i><i>y</i>.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(11)
 </p>
 <p>
   This is the equation used by the applet to calculate the potential
   energy.
 </p>
 <p>
   <u>Investigations</u>
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  Display the Data and Energy
   boxes.  Set the Electric Field slider to -50 V/m, i.e., set
   <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> = -50 V/m.  Don't change any of the other
   settings, i.e., keep the charge and mass at 3 C and 3.0 kg,
   respectively, and keep the velocity at 0.
 </p>
 <p>
   With <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> < 0, as in the present setting, Eq.(11)
   can be written
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>PE</i>(<i>y</i>) = <i>q</i>|<i>E<sub>y</sub></i>|<i>y</i>, <img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="10">if <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> < 0.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(12)
 </p>
 <p>
   This expression for the potential energy is analogous to the
   expression "<i>mgy</i>" that applies to a particle in the
   gravitational field of the earth if the <i>y</i>-axis is chosen to
   point upward as here.
 </p>
 <p>
   Drag the particle up and down, and observe that the values of the
   potential energy in the Data box increase and decrease and that the
   height of the potential energy column in the Energy box increases
   and decreases, respectively, just like for a particle in the earth's
   gravitational field.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 2</b>. Move the particle to <i>y</i> = 100 m, and
   calculate the potential energy using Eq.(12).  Compare the result
   with that shown in the Data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 3</b>. Drag the particle to the upper plate.  As in
   Activity 1, let's assume that puts the particle at <i>y</i> = 185
   m.  The particle's potential energy at this point is
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>PE</i>(<i>y</i>) = <i>q</i>|<i>E<sub>y</sub></i>|<i>y</i> =
   3&times;50&times;185 = 27,750 J.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(13)
 </p>
 <p>
   If for your window size the value of <i>y</i> when the particle is
   at the upper plate is different from 185 m, calculate the potential
   energy in your case and verify your result against the value
   displayed in the Data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   PLAY the motion until the particle hits the bottom plate.  Observe
   the column on the far right in the Energy box, and observe the
   decrease in potential energy and corresponding increase in kinetic
   energy so that the sum of the two remains conserved.  REWIND the
   motion and PLAY it once more, or STEP through the motion.
 </p>
 <p>
   Calculate the potential energy when the particle is at the bottom
   plate, with <i>y</i> = 15.0 m.  The answer is <i>PE</i>(15 m) =
   2,250 J.  Using both this value and value (13), or the
   corresponding value for your window size, use Eq.(6) to calculate
   the increase in kinetic energy during the fall from the upper to
   the lower plate.  The answer should agree with that found in
   Activity 1 and recorded in Eq.(4), i.e.,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> = <i>KE<sub>bottom</sub></i>
   = 25,500 J,<img src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space"
   height="1" width="20">(14)
 </p>
 <p>
   or should agree with the value corresponding to your plate
   separation.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 4</b>.  Repeat the calculations and observations done
   in Exercise 3, but with a different vertical drop <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>y</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>ACTIVITY 3</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is to perform
   similar observations and calculations as in Activity 2, but this
   time for a particle performing a kind of projectile motion, not a
   vertical drop.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  Set <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> =
   -50 V/m, and keep the charge and mass at 3 C and 3.0 kg,
   respectively.  
 </p>
 <p>
   Display the Data and Energy boxes.  Drag the particle to the bottom
   plate at <i>x</i> = 100 m, set the particle's speed to <i>v</i> =
   200 m, and the velocity direction to <font face="symbol">q</font> =
   30<sup>o</sup> relative to the positive <i>x</i>-axis.  Display the
   velocity vector and the particle's path.
 </p>
 <p>
   PLAY the motion.  You should obtain a parabolic trajectory, first
   rising, then falling.  REWIND the motion, and PLAY it again.
   Observe the energy columns.  Observe that while the particle is
   rising, the potential energy is increasing and the kinetic energy
   decreasing, and that the opposite is true when the particle is
   falling.  Is the kinetic energy zero when the particle is at the
   top of its path?
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Use the applet to determine the particle's
   kinetic energy approximately when the particle is at the top of its
   path.  Do this by PLAYing the motion and stopping it as nearly as
   you can at the peak of the trajectory.  STEPing the motion may
   help.  Record the value of the kinetic energy from the Data box
   when the particle is near the peak.
 </p>
 <p>
   Also determine the particle's <i>y</i>-coordinate at the peak using
   the value in the Data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 3</b>.  Calculate the kinetic energy at the bottom and
   at the peak.
 </p>
 <p>
   <u>Calculation of <i>KE</i></u>.  At the bottom plate,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>KE<sub>bottom</sub></i> = (<i>m</i>/2)<i>v</i><sup>2</sup> =
   (3/2)&times;200<sup>2</sup> = 60,000 J.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(15)
 </p>
 <p>
   The particle's <i>x</i>-component of velocity is constant because
   the <i>x</i>-component of the electric field and therefore the
   <i>x</i>-component of the force acting on the particle are zero.
   Thus, when the particle reaches the peak of its trajectory, its
   speed <i>v<sub>peak</sub></i> is not zero, but equal to the
   <i>x</i>-component of the particle's velocity.  (The
   <i>y</i>-component of velocity is zero at the peak.)  Thus, the
   particle's kinetic energy at the peak is equal to
 </p>
 <p>
   <img src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="40"><i>KE<sub>peak</sub></i> =
   (<i>m</i>/2)&times;<i>v<sub>x</sub></i><sup>2</sup> =
   (<i>m</i>/2)&times;(<i>v cos</i> 30<sup>o</sup>)<sup>2</sup>

   width="20">(16)
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 4</b>.  Calculate the particle's elevation
   <i>y<sub>peak</sub></i> at the peak of the trajectory using energy
   conservation.
 </p>
 <p>
   <u>Note on Potential Energy</u>.  Eqs.(11) and (12) for the
   potential energy still apply even though the present motion
   involves changes in <i>x</i> while the motion in Activity 2 did
   not.  The reason is that Eq.(8) for the work <i>W</i> done on the
   particle by the field applies whether the particle's displacement
   has a non-zero <i>x</i>-component or not.  The general expression
   for <i>W</i> in two dimensions is
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>W</i> = <img src="../images/F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
   align="bottom"><img src="../images/dot_orange.gif" alt="dot"
   align="bottom"><font face="symbol">D</font><img
   src="../images/r_orange.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom"> =
   <i>F<sub>x</sub></i><font face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> +
   <i>F<sub>y</sub></i><font face="symbol">D</font><i>y</i>.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(17)
 </p>
 <p>
   In the present case of the capacitor, with the electric field
   parallel to the <i>y</i>-axis, the <i>x</i>-component of the force
   exerted on the particle is zero.  Therefore, whether <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> is zero or not, the general expression
   (17) for the work done on the particle reduces to
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>W</i> = <i>F<sub>y</sub></i><font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>y</i>  =
   <i>qE<sub>y</sub></i><font face="symbol">D</font><i>y</i>.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="20">(18)
 </p>
 <p>
   Eq.(18) is identical with Eq.(8).  Therefore, Eq.(8) for <i>W</i>
   applies in all cases, no matter what motion the particle performs,
   and the theory developed in Activity 2 for vertical motion applies
   to general projectile motion also.  In particular, Eq.(11) for the
   potential energy applies along with Eq.(12) for the special case of
   a downward directed electric field, <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> < 0.
 </p>
 <p>
   <u>Calculation of the particle's elevation at the peak</u>.  The
   calculation is based on energy conservation.  Energy conservation
   involves the potential energy at the peak which in turn involves
   the particle's elevation at the peak.  Thus, energy conservation
   provides an equation for <i>y<sub>peak</sub></i>.
 </p>
 <p>
   The potential energy at the bottom plate has already been used
   earlier,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>PE<sub>bottom</sub></i> =
   <i>q</i>|<i>E<sub>y</sub></i>|<i>y<sub>bottom</sub></i> =
   3&times;50&times;15 = 2,250 J.<img src="../images/small_orange.gif"
   alt="space" height="1" width="20">(19)
 </p>
 <p>
   Combining values (15) and (19) gives for the total energy <i>E</i>
   the value
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>E</i> = <i>KE<sub>bottom</sub></i> + <i>PE<sub>bottom</sub></i>
   = 60,000 + 2,250 = 62,250 J.<img src="../images/small_orange.gif"
   alt="space" height="1" width="20">(20)
 </p>
 <p>
   There is no need to use the subscript "bottom" with the energy
   because the energy is conserved and therefore has the same value
   everywhere.  
 </p>
 <p>
	<b>Caution</b>: Here, the symbol "E" denotes the total energy, not
   the magnitude of the electric field.
 </p>
 <p>
   Equating the sum of the kinetic and potential energy at the peak to
   the energy value (20) gives the equation
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>KE<sub>peak</sub></i> + <i>PE<sub>peak</sub></i> = <i>E</i> =
   62,250 J.<img src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space"

 </p>
 <p>
   Substituting Value (16) for <i>KE<sub>peak</sub></i> and Expression
   (12) for the potential energy into Eq.(21) gives

   <b>Exercise 5</b>.  Repeat the preceding measurements and
   calculations for a different initial velocity.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>ACTIVITY 4</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is to investigate
   potential energy as a function of charge, electric field, and
   position.
 </p>
 <p>
   The general expression for the electric potential energy of the
   particle inside the capacitor is given by Eq.(11), derived earlier,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>PE</i>(<i>y</i>) = -<i>qE<sub>y</sub></i><i>y</i>.<img
   src="../images/small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"

 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  Display the Data and Energy
   boxes.  Keep the applet at its default settings, which are
 </p>
 <p>
   <ul> 
    <li><i>E<sub>y</sub></i> = 50 V/m,</li>
    <li><i>q</i> = 3 C,</li>
    <li><i>m</i> = 3.0 kg,</li>
    <li><img src="../images/v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
    align="bottom"> = 0.</li>
   </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
    Move the particle, and observe the values of <i>PE</i> and the
    height of the blue potential energy column.  
 </p>
 <p>
	 Because of the minus sign in Eq.(11), <i>PE</i> decreases
    as <i>y</i> increases and increases as <i>y</i> decreases, in
    proportion to <i>y</i>.  The "height" of the potential energy
    column is measured from the zero level, which is indicated by the
    thin black line across the energy columns.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Keep the particle's position fixed, and vary
   the particle's charge <i>q</i>.  The potential energy varies in
   proportion to <i>q</i>.  Given the values of the other parameters
   as listed in Exercise 1, the potential energy is negative if
   <i>q</i> is positive and is positive if <i>q</i> is negative.
 </p>

   <b>Exercise 3</b>.  Keep the particle's position fixed and set the
   charge to <i>q</i> = 3 C.  Vary the electric field, i.e.,
   <i>E<sub>y</sub></i>.  The potential energy varies in proportion to
   <i>E<sub>y</sub></i>.  It is negative for positive
   <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> and positive for negative
   <i>E<sub>y</sub></i>.
 </p>
 <p>
   Change <i>q</i> to - 3 C.  Again vary <i>E<sub>y</sub></i>.  Now
   the potential energy is positive if <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> is
   positive, and negative if <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> is negative .
 </p>
 <p>
   The potential energy is given by Eq.(11).  Any of the three factors
   on the right can be negative, in general, although the applet is
   set up so that <i>y</i> > 0 at all points between the plates.
   Thus, the sign of <i>PE</i> in the applet is determined by the
   signs of <i>q</i> and <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> alone.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 4</b>.  For a given setting of <i>q</i>,
   <i>E<sub>y</sub></i>, and <i>y</i>, calculate the potential energy.
   Compare your result with the value in the Data box.
