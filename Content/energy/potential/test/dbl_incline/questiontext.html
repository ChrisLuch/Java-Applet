<p align="left">
Two blocks on a frictionless double incline are connected via a string
and a frictionless pulley. The masses of the blocks and the
inclination angles are shown.  You can drag either block and observe
how the potential energy changes.

<p>Answer the following question by using the principle that the
blocks will move so that the combined potential energy decreases.

<p align="left">
Upon release, which way will the left block move?


<p>
(a) It will move up.

<p>
(b) It will move down. 

<p>
(c) It will remain at rest.
