You picked choice (b), saying that the 0.6-kg block will move
downward. It is tempting to say so because this block is heavier
than the 0.4-kg block.  However, the 0.4-kg block is on a steeper
incline, which may compensate for its smaller weight.

<p align="left">
The blocks will move so that their combined potential energy decreases
as they move. They are in equilibrium if it does not change when they
move.

<p align="left">
Try to work out by how much the potential energy changes if both
blocks move 1 m, in the same general direction, and determine if this
change is positive, negative or zero.
