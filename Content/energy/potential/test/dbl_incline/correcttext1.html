<p align="left"> Yes, the 0.6-kg block will move up, even though it is heavier 
  than the other one. You can see this happening by clicking the START button. 
  Observe the resulting change in total potential energy; as the masses move, the 
  total length of the potential energy bars labeled PE1 and PE2 decreases. 
<p align="center"><b>Solution</b></p>

<p align="left">
<b>Strategy</b>. We will use the principle that a system of particles
will try to lower its potential energy if allowed to move
spontaneously.

<p align="left">
The system consists of the earth and the two blocks. Its potential
energy arises from the interactions between the earth and block 1 and
the earth and block 2. (The interaction between the two blocks
themselves is totally negligible.)

<p align="left">
We will calculate the change in the system's total potential energy
when the blocks undergo a given displacement and check if it is
positive or negative.  If negative, then this is the direction in
which the blocks will move.
