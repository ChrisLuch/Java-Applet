You picked choice (c), saying that the blocks will remain at rest. 

<p align="left">
It is a bit hard to guess what will happen. Although the 0.6-kg block
is heavier, the 0.4-kg block is on a steeper incline which compensates
for its smaller weight. 

<p align="left">
The blocks will move so that their combined potential energy decreases
as they move. They are in equilibrium if it does not change when they
move.

<p align="left">
Try to work out by how much the potential energy changes if both
blocks move 1 m, in the same general direction, and see if this
change is positive, negative or zero.
