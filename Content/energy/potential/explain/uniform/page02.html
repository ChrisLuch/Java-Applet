<div class="title">The Concept of Potential Energy</div>

<p><b>Answers</b>.  When the two bodies are farther apart, their
potential energy is greater.  When the distance between them
decreases, so does the potential energy.  You can observe this most
easily by dragging one of the bodies before clicking PLAY.
</p>

<p>Upon clicking PLAY, while the two bodies are moving subject to only
their gravitational interaction, the system's kinetic energy increases
as its potential energy decreases, and vice versa, so that the sum of
the two energies remains constant.
</p>

<p><b>Experiment</b>.  Let us observe this again, for the special case
in which the two bodies move either directly away from or towards each
other.  To do so, adjust the initial velocities (red vectors) so that
they either point towards or away from each other.  Observe how, as
the bodies 'rise' or 'fall', kinetic energy is converted into equal
amounts of potential energy or vice versa, respectively.  You can
<b>step</b> through the motion if you like.
</p>

<p>On the next page, this process will be illustrated with an example
'closer to home'.
