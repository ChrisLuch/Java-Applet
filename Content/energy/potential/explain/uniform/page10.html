<div class="title">Potential Energy Quantitative</div>

<p>On Page 9, when calculating the kinetic energy at <i>y</i> = 10 m,
we started from the equation</p>

<p class="equation"><i>KE<sub>10</sub></i> - <i>KE<sub>6</sub></i> =
- (<i>PE<sub>10</sub></i> - <i>PE<sub>6</sub></i>).</p>

<p>Using this equation, we would have obtained the same result
<i>KE<sub>10</sub></i> = 14 J, if instead of <i>PE</i> = <i>mgy</i> we
had used for the potential energy an expression with an added
constant, say,</p>

<p class="equation"><i>PE</i> = <i>mgy</i> + 15 J .</p>

<p>The additional constant of 15 J would have canceled when taking the
difference <i>PE<sub>10</sub></i> - <i>PE<sub>6</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Let's go back to the basic definition of potential energy on Page
7.  There the <b>change</b> in potential energy was defined via</p>

<p class="equation"><font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> = -
<i>W<sub>grav</sub></i>.</p>

<p>This equation defines the potential energy only to within an
additive constant, because a <b>change</b> in the potential energy is
not affected if all values of the potential energy are increased by
the same amount.</p>

<p>By adding a constant to the potential energy, one changes the
elevation at which the potential energy is equal to zero.  To be able
to do so is often convenient.  An experimenter working on the fifth
floor of a building may want to take the potential energy to be zero
on that floor, while another experimenter working on the first floor
may want to take the potential energy to be zero on that floor of the
building.  As long as one sticks to one convention consistently,
throughout a calculation, it does not matter where one chooses the
potential energy to be zero.</p>

<p>In the simulation, you can adjust the zero-point of the potential
energy by dragging the energy scale up or down.  Do the calculation
from Page 9 with a different setting of the energy scale and convince
yourself that this will not affect the value of the kinetic energy at
y = 10 m.</p>

<p>Similarly, it is arbitrary where one chooses the origin of the
<i>y</i> axis.  That axis too can be dragged upward or downward.</p>

<p>The general expression for the gravitational potential energy of an
object of mass <i>m</i> near the surface then is</p>

<p class="equation"><i>PE</i> = <i>mgy</i> + const </p>

<p>where the value of the added constant depends on where one has
chosen the potential energy to be zero and where one has chosen the
origin of the <i>y</i> axis to be.</p>
