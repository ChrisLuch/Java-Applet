<p><b>Question</b>.  On Page 5, three properties of the gravitational
potential energy are specified.  Let us find a mathematical expression
that has all of these properties.</p>

<p>Let us solve this problem for the special case of a <b>uniform</b>
gravitational force field, as we have near the surface of the earth.
'Uniform' means that the force has the same magnitude and direction
everywhere.  This is true for the gravitational force exerted on an
object within a few hundred meters of the surface of the earth and
within a horizontal range in which the earth's curvature is not
significant.</p>

<p><b>Hints</b>.  The distance between the surface of the earth and
the ball can be measured by the variable y indicated by the brown
scale.  We will see later that it is not important where the origin
<i>y</i> = 0 is placed, but for the moment you may imagine it to be at
the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>Look for an expression for <i>PE</i> that is a function of
<i>y</i>.</p>

<p>When the kinetic energy of a ball increases by 20 J, its potential
energy must decrease by 20 J.  In other words, if <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> = 20 J, then <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> = -20 J.  In general, if only the
gravitational force is acting on the ball,</p>

<p><center><font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> = - <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>. </center></p>

<p>The work-kinetic energy theorem (see under Related Items) says
that <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> is equal to the work done
by the force of gravity on the ball.  Use this fact to find an
expression for <font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> that satisfies
the equation above.  Then go on to Page 7 to compare.</p>
