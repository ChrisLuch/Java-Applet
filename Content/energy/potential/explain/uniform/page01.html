  <li><u>Pages 3 to 5</u>: Gravitational potential energy near the earth's
  surface; qualitative.</li>

<p>The simulation shows a system of two gravitationally interacting
bodies, e.g., a binary star system.  The blue column shows the
potential energy, <i>PE</i>, of the system.  The kinetic energy of the
system, <i>KE</i>, is represented by the red column.  You can ignore
the scale, for the time being.</p>

<p>Potential energy is often called <i>energy of position</i>.  Here
is a question that relates potential energy to position, followed by a
question that relates potential to kinetic energy.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  Does the potential energy of the system increase
or decrease as the distance between the bodies increases?  What
happens to the kinetic energy, <i>KE</i>, of the system as the
potential energy increases?  Click PLAY and observe.
