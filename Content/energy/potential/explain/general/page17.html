<center><h2>The Concept of Potential Energy</h2></center>
<p>Now, in your notebook, write down in your own words how potential energy is defined and what its connection is with mechanical energy conservation.</p>

<p>In your explanation, include a discussion of the following aspects of potential energy using examples whenever possible.</p>

<p>1.  Potential energy is related to the interaction between <b>two</b> objects.  It is cannot be defined for just a single object. Suppose you definedthe potential energy change <font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i><sub>1</sub> of an object 1 interacting with an object 2 by <font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i><sub>1</sub> = - <i>W</i><sub>1</sub> where <i>W</i><sub>1</sub> is the work done on object 1 by object 2, why would this <font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i><sub>1</sub> not depend on the coordinates of object 1 alone?</p>

<p>2.  A two-particle system will have <b>one</b> potential energy term, related to the interaction between the two particles, but <b>two</b> kinetic energy terms, one for each particle.  Occasionally, one of the two kinetic energy terms is so small that it can be neglected.</p>

<p>3.  In order to lift a ball from the surface of the earth, one needs to apply an upward force on the ball.  This force does work on the ball while lifting the ball, but this work is <b>not</b> the work used in defining the potential energy of the ball-earth system.  The lifting force is <b>not</b> a gravitational force.  The potential energy of the ball-earth system is defined in terms of the gravitational forces within this system.</p>

<p>4.  The work done by the gravitational force that the earth exerts on a ball as the ball undergoes some displacement does not depend on the speed of the ball.  It depends only on the ball's displacement.  Thus, in calculating the potential energy of the ball-earth system, one does not need to take any kinetic energy changes of the ball into account.</p>

<p>5.  The potential energy of a system is determined only up to an arbitrary constant.  One can choose this constant so that the potential energy is zero for a given configuration of the system (by 'configuration' one means the positions of the particles of the system).  Once a value for the potential energy has been chosen for one configuration, the values for all other configurations are determined by <font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> = -<i>W</i>.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b>.  Not all forces of interaction between two objects allow the definition of a potential energy.  Friction forces are an example of forces for which a potential energy <b>cannot</b> be defined.  Forces that do allow the definition of a potential energy are called <i>conservative forces</i>.  Gravitational forces and electrostatic forces are conservative.</p> 

<p>The basic property that an interaction force must possess so that a potential energy can be defined for it is that, as the system is displaced from an initial to a final configuration, the work done by the force is independent of how the system goes from the initial to the final configuration.</p>
