<center><h2>The Concept of Potential Energy</h2></center>

<p>We have been talking a lot about kinetic energy on the preceding
pages although this session is titled "The Concept of Potential
Energy".  Why is this?

<p>The reason is that we want to <b>define</b> this new quantity
called potential energy so that an <b>increase</b> in the kinetic
energy of a system can be accounted for by a corresponding
<b>decrease</b> in potential energy.  So we need to know how kinetic
energy changes in order to be able to define potential energy
accordingly.

<p><b>Watch the motion of the orbiting two bodies once more</b>. This time
the kinetic energies of the two bodies will be shown also.

<p><b>Question</b>.  Is the total kinetic energy of the system
constant during the motion?

<p><b>Answer</b>.  No.  (Unless you arrange things so that the
  distance between the objects remains constant.)  Neither was the
  total kinetic energy constant for the earth-ball system. Both in
  that system and here, the kinetic energy is least when the two
  objects are farthest from each other.
