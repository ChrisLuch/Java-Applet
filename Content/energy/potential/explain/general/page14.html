<center><h2>The Concept of Potential Energy</h2></center>
<IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="p13image.gif">
<p>We have derived the following expression for the gravitational potential energy of the ball-earth system:</p>
<p><center><i>PE</i> at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)  =  <i>mgy</i> .</center></p>

<p>Remember that you can add a constant to this and obtain another acceptable expression for the potential energy of the system.  Adding a constant would amount to picking a different elevation at which <i>PE</i> = 0.</p>

<p>Now it is easy to write down the energy conservation equation for the ball-earth system.  Since the earth's speed is totally negligible in this situation, we can ignore the earth's kinetic energy.  Therefore, energy conservation gives the equation</p>

<p><center><i>E</i>  =  <i>KE<sub>ball</sub></i> + <i>KE<sub>earth</sub></i> + <i>PE</i>  =  (<i>m</i>/2)<i>v</i><sup>2</sup>  + 0 + <i>mgy</i>  =  const.</center></p>

<p>Here <i>m</i> and <i>v</i> are the ball's mass and speed, respectively.</p>

<p>Observe that at first glance all quantities in this equation seem to be referring to the ball alone, suggesting that energy conservation applies to just the ball.  However, this would be an incorrect understanding.  The factor <i>g</i> in this equation is depends on the mass of the earth and the distance between the ball and the center of the earth, so the presence of the earth is reflected in this equation.  In mechanics, a potential energy always characterizes the interaction between <i>two</i> (or more) particles.  Also, we had to neglect the earth's kinetic energy to get to the conservation equation above.  Although this is a minute mistake, it is nevertheless a mistake, in principle.</p>
<p>It is very common to talk of the 'potential energy of the ball' when referring to <i>mgy</i> and to say that the 'ball's mechanical energy' is conserved. This is conveinient but, strictly speaking, not correct. The correct statements would refer to <i>mgy</i> as the 'potential energy of the ball-earth system' and say that the 'mechanical energy of the ball-earth system' is conserved.</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> How about an application of the energy conservation equation above?  Suppose the ball leaves the hand with a speed of 8.0 m/s.  What is its speed at the point where the motion is frozen, which is <font face="symbol">D</font><i>y</i> = 2.5 m higher than the point where the ball left the hand?  Try to work out the answer.  When done, go on to the next page to compare.</p>
