<center><h2>The Concept of Potential Energy</h2></center>

<p>The curved motion of the ball on Page 3 is more like the curved
  motions of the double-star system on Page 1, but, again, the earth's
  motion is imperceptible.

<p><b>Run the animation once more</b> and watch how the kinetic energy
  of the ball-earth system changes during the motion.  Does it
  <b>decrease</b> as the ball goes up and the system's potential
  energy increases?

<p>The kinetic energy shown is the sum of the ball's and earth's
kinetic energies. However, the part that is the earth's kinetic energy
is totally negligible because of the earth's negligible speed.
