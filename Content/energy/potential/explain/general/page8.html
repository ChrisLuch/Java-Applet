{\sf {What can we use for \textit{PE} that depends on the positions of the particles and that added to the total kinetic energy $\textit{KE} = \textit{KE}_1 + \textit{KE}_2$ gives a constant,
\par
$KE + PE = const?$
\par
Another way of saying this is to say that the changes $\Delta PE + \Delta KE$ in these quantities that occur in a given time interval must add up to zero,
\par
$\Delta KE + \Delta PE = 0.$
\par
The work-kinetic energy theorem, ${W} = \Delta KE$, can be written in the form,
\par
$\Delta KE - W = 0,$
\par
where \textit{W} is the work done on the system during the given time interval by the gravitational forces $\F_1$ and $\F_2$.  These forces depend on the positions of the particles, and \textit {W} will depend on their initial and final positions in the given time interval.
\par
Thus, we can take
\par
$\Delta PE = -W.$
