<center><h2>The Concept of Potential Energy</h2></center>
<p>It turns out that the potential energy, and with it the mechanical energy, are not defined uniquely by <font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> = -<i>W</i>.  This is always a bit hard to understand at first because in daily life energy is treated as something very definite.  E.g., one speaks of a daily energy intake of 2000 Calories.  However, these 2000 Calories really refer to a <b>change</b> in chemical energy, the difference in chemical energy of the food materials before and after combustion. </p>
 
<p>We want to find a position-dependent expression, called potential energy <i>PE</i>, such that throughout the particles' motion</p>

<p><center><i>KE</i> + <i>PE</i> = <i>E</i> = const .</center></p>

<p>Suppose we have found a suitable <i>PE</i>.  Let us consider another potential energy expression, <i>PE'</i>, obtained by adding a constant amount of energy to <i>PE</i>, say, 5 J,</p>

<p><center><i>PE'</i> = <i>PE</i> + 5 J.</center></p>

<p>Obviously, with <i>PE'</i> instead of <i>PE</i> as the potential energy, we have</p>

<p><center><i>KE</i> + <i>PE'</i> = <i>E</i> + 5 J = <i>E'</i> = const.</center></p>

<p>Thus, <i>KE</i> + <i>PE'</i> is constant also, and therefore <i>PE'</i> = <i>PE</i> + 5 J is a possible potential energy also.  Of course, instead of 5 J we could have added any other constant value.</p>

<p>Thus, if we can find one possible <i>PE</i>, we can find infinitely many, all differing from each other by some constant.</p>
