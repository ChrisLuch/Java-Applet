<center><h2>The Concept of Potential Energy</h2></center>
<IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="p13image.gif">
<p>Suppose we set the potential energy of the ball-earth system equal to zero at the beginning of the trajectory, at a point with <i>x, y</i> coordinates (<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>,0).  At the instant at which the motion is frozen, the ball is at a point with coordinates (<i>x,y</i>).  To find the ball's potential energy at this point, we need to determine the change <font face="symbol">D</font> <i>PE</i> in the ball's potential energy as the ball goes from the initial point at (<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>,0) to the final point at (<i>x,y</i>).  This change is equal to</p>

where \textit {W}  is the total work done by the gravitational forces exerted by the ball on the earth and by the earth on the ball.  The gravitational work done on the earth is totally negligible because the earth's displacement is totally negligible.  Thus, \textit {W}  can be taken to be equal to the gravitational work done on just the ball, which is
\par
$ W  = \F \Delta \r = \F_x \Delta x + \F_y \Delta y =  0 - mg \Delta y  =  - mg \Delta y.$
\par
Here $\r = (\Delta x, \Delta y)$ is the ball's displacement.  We can use a finite displacement to calculate \textit {W} because the force is constant.  Only the vertical component $\Delta y$ of the displacement matters because the horizontal component of the gravitational force is zero.
\par
Since here $\Delta y = y - 0 = y$ and since $PE = 0$ at $(x_i,0)$, we obtain
\par
\textit{PE} at $(x,y) = PE$ at $(x_i,0) - W  =  0  +  mg \Delta y  =  mgy.$
\par
The expression \textit {mgy} for the gravitational potential energy may be well-known to you from earlier physics classes.  The present derivation, however, may contain some details that you have not seen before.
