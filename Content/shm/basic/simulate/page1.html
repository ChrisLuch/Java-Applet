    <div class="title">Simple Harmonic Motion</div>

    <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates simple harmonic motion (shm) as
    performed by a weight suspended from a spring.  It is demonstrated
    that this motion is simple harmonic motion by showing that the
    motion is projected uniform circular motion.

    <p>Detailed information on how to use the applet and a lesson on shm
    is available from the applet's Help menu.

    <p>The applet allows variation of

      <p>
    <ul>
      <li>spring constant,</li> 
      <li>mass,</li>
      <li>amplitude,</li>
      <li>initial phase.</li>
    </ul>
