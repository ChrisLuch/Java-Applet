        <div class="title">Instantaneous Speed</div>

        <p>The instantaneous speed of a mass point at a given instant is
        approximated by the average speed over a short time interval
        containing the given instant.  If one takes shorter and shorter time
        intervals, always embracing the given instant, shrinking in size to
        zero duration, then the limiting value of the average speed is
        called the <i>speed</i> at the given instant.

        <p>The symbol for speed is <i>v</i>.  The SI-unit of speed is m/s.

        <p>In this definition, &Delta;<i>t</i> denotes the duration of a
        time interval containing the given instant and <i>s</i> denotes the
        distance traveled by the mass point during this time interval.

        <p>The terms <i>speed</i> and <i>instantaneous speed</i> are used
        interchangeably.  Most of the time one just says 'speed'.
