<p>
  <b>Preparation</b>: Speed/Average/Explain It/(Distance/Time)</b>
</p>

<p>
 The explanation of average speed on the following pages uses the
 applet on the left.  For instructions on how to use the applet see
 Help and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.  In
 addition, it is recommended you work through the Lesson under Applet
 Help.
</p>

<p>
 You may want to experiment a bit with the applet before going on to
 Page 2.

<p>
 <b>Exercise</b>.  Play the applet and vary the speed by means of the
 slider.  The speed is plotted vs. time in red.  At the same time the
 corresponding average speed calculated from the initial moment
 <i>t</i> = 0 to the current instant of time <i>t</i> is plotted in
 blue.  For details see the Help and ShowMe files.  
</p>

<p>
 Hide the speed vs. time graph by deselecting its checkbox, and
 observe the object whose speed is being plotted.
