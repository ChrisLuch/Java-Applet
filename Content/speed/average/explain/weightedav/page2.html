<p>
 <b>Exercise</b>.  RESET the applet, and hide the <i>speed
 vs. time</i> graph so that the car is visible.  
<p>
</p>
 Set the speed to 12.0 m/s, and PLAY the motion.  PAUSE it when the
 car is half-way around its oval orbit (or close to it).  Change the
 speed to 24.0 m/s, and continue the motion until the car has
 completed one round (or close to it).
</p>
<p>
 Calculate the car's average speed for one round.
</p>
<p>
 Display the speed vs. time graph.  Compare the exact value of the
 average speed displayed in blue with your calculated value.
</p>
<p>
 See Page 3 for a calculation of the average speed.
