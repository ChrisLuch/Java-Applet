  <div class="title">Average Speed</div>

<p><b>Caution</b>. The definition of average speed given on Page 2 is
easy to use.  Nevertheless, it is sometimes tempting to calculate
average speed differently, namely, by taking it to be equal tothe
arithmetic mean of the initial and final speed for a given time
interval.</p>

<p>This is <b>not</b> a correct way of calculating average speed.</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>. Display the average-speed Data box. Position the
ball somewhere, and release the mouse button.  Click on the ball
again, but don't immediately drag it while still holding the mouse
button down.  The clock is already running while the ball's speed is
still zero.  Then drag the ball to a new position, but don't release
the mouse button.  Again, the clock keeps running while the ball's
speed is zero.  Now release the mouse button.</p>

<p>The average speed Data box will show the average speed to be
<b>greater</b> than zero.  However, the mean of the initial and final
speeds is clearly <b>equal</b> to zero, because both of these speeds
are zero.  The former (non-zero) value is correct because it was
obtained using the definition of average speed as distance traveled
divided by time elapsed, but the latter (zero) value is not.</p>
