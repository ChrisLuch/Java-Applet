    <div class="title">Average Speed As Weighted Average</div>

    <p>
      The applet on Page 2 simulates that the average speed of an object
          during a time interval is the weighted average of the object's
          speeds in portions of that time interval.
    </p>

    <p>
      Detailed information on how to use the applet and a lesson on
      average speed as a weighted average is available under Applet Help
      on the applet's Help menu.
