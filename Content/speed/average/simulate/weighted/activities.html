    <div class="title">Activities on Average Speed as a Time-weighted Average</div>

    <p>
      <b>Activity on the average speed of two speeds</b>  
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  Set the Number of Bins to 20
      and the Speed to 24.0 m/s.  PLAY the motion until the car has
      completed one round, as closely as you can make it.  Change the
      speed to 48.0 m/s, and continue the motion until the car has
      completed another round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculate the car's average speed for the two rounds, and compare
      your result with the exact value for the average speed displayed on
      the Speed vs. Time graph or in the Data box.  A slight difference between
      the two values must be expected because in the actual motion the car
      will not have gone exactly one round at 24 m/s and exactly one round
      at 48 m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Don't reset the applet.  Display the Speed
      vs. Time graph for the previous motion, and observe that the average
      speed for the two rounds (horizontal blue line) is closer to 24 m/s
      than to 48 m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that the time interval during which the car travels at
      24-m/s is longer than the time interval during which it travels at
      48-m/s.  In your Notebook, write a few sentences explaining how
      these two facts are related.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Don't reset the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true for any speed vs. time graph that the area under the
      graph for a time interval of duration &Delta;<i>t</i> is equal to
      the distance <i>s</i> traveled during the time interval. If one
      indicates the average speed during this time interval by a
      horizontal line, as in the applet's Speed vs. Time graph, he
      distance traveled is also equal to the area under this line because
      <i>s</i> = <i>v<sub>av</sub></i>&Delta;<i>t</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verify that the areas under the applet's Speed vs. Time graph and
      under the blue average-speed line, both taken for the entire two
      rounds, are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can approximately read the times elapsed during which the speeds
      of 24 m/s and 48 m/s were maintained from the graph.  You can get
      the exact values from the Data box.  Bins 9 and 19 contain the
      speeds 24 m/s and 48 m/s, respectively.  The times in the column
      headed "Acc. Time: t(s)" are the exact times elapsed while these
      speeds were maintained during the simulated motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Don't reset the applet.  Press the Data button to
      display the table of speed bins.  With the number of bins equal to
      20, the speed interval from 0 to 50 m/s is subdivided into 20 bins
      of width 2.5 m/s.  Find the bins containing the speeds 24.0 m/s and
      48.0 m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verify the <i>bin speed average</i> listed below the bin table as
      follows.  For each bin, take the speed <i>v</i> at the midpoint of
      each bin, the <i>bin speed</i>, and multiply it by the total time
      <i>t</i> during which the car's speed was in this bin (this is
      called the <i>accumulated time</i>).  Add all products <i>vt</i> and
      divide by the total time elapsed (sum of the times accumulated in
      all bins).
    </p>
    <p>
      The bin speed average is close to, but in general not equal to, the
      exact average speed because in general the bin speeds (taken at the
      midpoint of each bin) are not exactly equal to the true speeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>.  Do not reset the applet.  Display the
      Accumulated Time vs. Speed graph together with the bin table (Data
      button).  In a few sentences, explain how the graph represents the
      data in the bin table.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 6</b>.  RESET the applet.  Set the number of bins to 20.
      PLAY the motion at a speed of 12.0 m/s for 10.0 s (or as close to
      10.0 s as possible), PAUSE the motion, then PLAY it at 24.0 m/s for
      another 10.0 s (or as close to 10.0 s as possible).  In your
      Notebook, make a graph of speed vs. time for this motion, calculate
      the average speed and indicate it by a horizontal line in your
      graph.  Also make a graph of accumulated time vs. speed for this
      motion, using bins of 2.5 m/s width.  Compare your graphs and
      calculations with the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 7</b>.  Repeat Exercise 7 several times, but each time
      with a different duration of the 24.0-m/s speed interval.  Choose
      20.0 s, 30.0, and 40.0 s for this time interval.  RESET the applet
      before each repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 8</b>.  RESET the applet.  Compare two motions: one in
      which a speed of 12.0 m/s is maintained for 10.0 s and followed by a
      speed of 24.0 m/s maintained for 20.0 s with another motion with a
      speed of 24.0 m/s maintained for for 10.0 s, followed by a speed of
      12.0 m/s maintained for 10.0 s, followed by a speed of 24.0 m/s
      maintained for 10.0 s.  Both motions have the same accumulated times
      for the 12.0 m/s and 24.0-m/s speeds, namely, 10.0 and 20.0 s,
      respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculate and compare the average speeds for the two motions, and
      compare the Accumulated Time vs. Speed and Speed vs. Time graphs for
      the two motions.  Also compare the data in the corresponding bin
      tables.  In a few sentences, describe and explain what you find.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity on the average speed of three speeds</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>.  The average speed <i>v<sub>av</sub></i> of two
      speeds <i>v<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>v<sub>2</sub></i>, maintained
      during time intervals of duration <i>t<sub>1</sub></i> and
      <i>t<sub>2</sub></i>, respectively, is equal to
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="40"><i>v<sub>av</sub></i> = (<i>t<sub>1</sub></i> /
      <i>t</i>) <i>v<sub>1</sub></i> + (<i>t<sub>2</sub></i> / <i>t</i>)
      <i>v<sub>2</sub></i><img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="40">(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      where <i>t</i> = <i>t<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>t<sub>2</sub></i> is the
      total travel time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a derivation of Equ.(1) see Kinematics/Speed/Average/Explain
      It/Weighted Average, Page 3.  Modifying the derivation
      appropriately, show that the average speed of three speeds
      <i>v<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>v<sub>2</sub></i>, and
      <i>v<sub>3</sub></i>, maintained during time intervals of duration
      <i>t<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>t<sub>2</sub></i>, and
      <i>t<sub>3</sub></i>, respectively, is equal to
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="40"><i>v<sub>av</sub></i> = (<i>t<sub>1</sub></i> /
      <i>t</i>) <i>v<sub>1</sub></i> + (<i>t<sub>2</sub></i> / <i>t</i>)
      <i>v<sub>2</sub></i> + (<i>t<sub>3</sub></i> / <i>t</i>)
      <i>v<sub>3</sub></i><img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="40">(2)
    </p>
    <p>
      where <i>t</i> is again the total travel time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  RESET the applet.  Make the car move through
      three rounds, the first round at 10 m/s, the second round at 20 m/s,
      and the third round at 40 m/s.  Use Equ.(2) to calculate the average
      speed, and compare your value with that given by the applet.
