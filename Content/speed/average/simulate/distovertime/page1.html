        <div class="title">Average Speed vs. Average Velocity</div>

        <p><b>Preparation</b>: Speed/Average/Explain It/(Distance/Time).

        <p>The applet is on Page 2.  Instructions on how to use the applet and
        a lesson on average speed and average velocity are available from the
        applet's Help menu under Applet Help.  At the beginning of the lesson,
        there is a useful listing of relevant notation and definitions.

        <p>The applet lets you drag a ball, and it displays the ball's average
        speed and average velocity during the dragging process and quantities
        needed to calculate the average speed and average velocity.
