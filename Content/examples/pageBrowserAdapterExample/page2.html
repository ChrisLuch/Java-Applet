The Frameset Files
</div>

 <p>
   A content item can contain any number of pages, and each page can
   contain any number of frames. A frame will display any URL one
   wants it to display. It is very important that the frameset is
   built and named carefully. The frameset for our example is built as
   follows.
 </p>
 <p>
   If the page has only one frame (Pages 3 or 6), the frame is called
   MAIN; if the page has two frames, the two frames are called
   LEFT_SIDE and RIGHT_SIDE and these two frames are put into the MAIN
   frame.
 </p>
 <p>
   The MAIN frame is defined by the file "main.html".  The part of
   this file that we will need in the following explanations is
   reproduced below.
 </p>
 <p>
   Excerpt from file "main.html":
 </p>
 <p>
  <PRE>
&lt;frameset rows="*,40" cols="*" border="0" framespacing="0" frameborder="NO">
   &lt;frame src="frameset.html" name = "MAIN" noresize>
   &lt;frame src="pagebrowser.html" noresize scrolling = "NO">
&lt;/frameset>
  </PRE>
 </p>

 <p>
   The LEFT_SIDE and RIGHT_SIDE frames are set up in the
   "frameset.html" file described next:
 </p>

 <p>
   Excerpt from file "frameset.html":
 </p>
 <p>
  <PRE>
&lt;frameset cols = "375,*" border = "0">
  &lt;frame src="white.html" name = "LEFT_SIDE" noresize scrolling = "NO">
  &lt;frame src="white.html" name = "RIGHT_SIDE" noresize>
&lt;/frameset>
  </PRE>
 </p>

 <p>
   The file "frameset.html" will be placed in the MAIN frame whenever
    we need two frames instead of one (pages 1,2,4,5,7). When just one
    frame is needed, the url is loaded directly in the MAIN frame
    instead of "frameset.html&quot".<br>
   The srcs for each of the frames in "frameset.html" are
    "white.html". This is just a blank html file that is used until
    the pagebrowser loads in the correct frame. If "applet.html" and
    "page1.html" were used instead, then when one went from page 3 to
    page 4, "page1.html" would be loaded in on LEFT_SIDE when
    "frameset.html" is loaded, then the PageBrowser would load
    "page4.html" in LEFT_SIDE. This doesn't look good and causes
    problems when a page contains applet tags and plugins that are
    killed shortly after starting up.
