 <div class="title">Static and Kinetic Friction</div>

 <p>
  Friction is a component of the contact force between two objects
  that are touching.  The component of the contact force perpendicular
  to the surface of contact is called <i>normal force</i>.  The
  component of the contact force in the surface of contact is called
  <i>friction</i>.  Friction is discussed here in the context of a
  block on a table surface, as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 below.
 </p>
 <p>
  Friction is a complicated phenomenon related to surface
  irregularities between the two objects in contact.  When the block
  is sliding across the table, surface irregularities protruding both
  at the top of the table and at the bottom of the block and in
  contact with each other get deformed briefly until breaking apart
  again.  When the block is at rest while being pulled to one side,
  the surface irregularities again are being deformed.  These
  deformations are responsible for the friction forces that the table
  exerts on the block and the block exerts on the table.  When block
  and table are moving relative to each other, one speaks of
  <i>kinetic</i> friction forces.  When block and table are at rest
  relative to each other, one speaks of <i>static</i> friction forces.

  <u>Kinetic Friction</u>

 <p>
  The friction force that the table exerts on the block and the
  friction force that the block exerts on the table form an
  action-reaction pair of forces.  According to Newton's Third Law,
  they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.  The
  direction of a kinetic friction force is always such that it opposes
  the motion.  In the image above, the block is moving to the right,
  so that the friction force acting on the block is to the left, as
  indicated by the red arrow in the free-body diagram for the block in
  Figure 1.  No free-body diagram for the table is shown, and so the
  friction force acting on the table is not represented.  In the
  present case, its direction is to the right.
 </p>

 <p>
  In reality, the magnitude of the force of friction depends on the
  speed with which the block is moving and it depends non-linearly on
  the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the table on the block.
  However, the following simplified model of friction is widely used
  and is used also in all MAP materials.  In this model, the magnitude
  <i>F<sub>fric,kin</sub></i> of the force of kinetic friction is
  assumed to be proportional to the magnitude <i>N</i> of the normal
  force exerted by the table on the block, so that
 </p>

 <p align="center">
  <i>F<sub>fric,kin</sub></i> = &mu;<sub>k</sub> <i>N</i>. <img src="small.gif"
  alt="space" height="1" width="40">(1)
 </p>

 <p>
  The proportionality factor &mu;<sub>k</sub>
  is assumed to be independent of the velocity of the block.  It is
  called <i>kinetic coefficient of friction</i>.
 </p>

 <p>
  <u>Static Friction</u>
 </p>

 <p>
   Static friction has its causes in the same kind of mechanism as
   kinetic friction, but static friction is different from kinetic
   friction in one important respect.
 </p>

 <p>
   The following image shows the block at rest while an applied force
   is acting on it.  The block is not moving because a static friction
   force is acting on the block whose horizontal component is opposite
   in direction and equal in magnitude to the horizontal component of
   the applied force.  Compare the magnitudes of the horizontal
   components of these two forces in the free-body diagram for the
   block in Figure 2 below.  You may want to have another look at the
   free-body diagram in Figure 1 in which these magnitudes are
   unequal.
 </p>

   <b>Figure 2</b>
 </p>

 <p>
   The magnitude of the force of static friction acting on the block
   does not have a fixed value, as does the magnitude of the force of
   kinetic friction, but adjusts itself in response to the other
   forces acting on the block so that the net force acting on the
   block remains zero, up to a certain point.  The magnitude of the
   force of static friction cannot exceed a certain maximum, which
   depends on the nature of the irregularities in the contacting
   surfaces of block and table and on the magnitude of the normal
   force that table and block is exerting on each other.
 </p>
 <p>
   In the simplistic model of friction that for the magnitude of the
   force of kinetic friction uses Eq.(1), the maximum magnitude of the
   force of static friction is assumed to be given by the equation
 </p>
 <p align="center">
  <i>F<sub>stat,max</sub></i> = &mu;<sub>s</sub> <i>N</i>. <img src="small.gif"
  alt="space" height="1" width="40">(2)
 </p>
 <p>
  The proportionality constant <font
  face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub> is called <i>static coefficient
  of friction</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another way of formulating the content of Eq.(2) is via the inequality
 </p>
 <p align="center">
  <i>F<sub>stat</sub></i> <img src="lessequal.gif" alt="less or equal"
  align="bottom"> &mu;<sub>s</sub>
  <i>N</i>. <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40">(3)
 </p>
 <p>
   Note that in Inequality (3) we have on the left-hand side the
   magnitude of the friction force, not the <b>maximimum</b> magnitude
   as in Eq.(2).
 </p>
 <p>
   It is usually the case that &mu;<sub>s</sub> &gt;
   &mu;<sub>k</sub> for most objects in contact.
 </p>
 <p>
   The direction of the force of static friction acting on an object
   is such that it opposes the object's tendency to move in response
   to other forces acting on the object.
