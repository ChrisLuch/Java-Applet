<p>On the left is a timer, &quot;attached&quot; to a red square. When
the <b>Start Timer</b> button is clicked, the square turns yellow and
a random amount of time will pass before the square turns red
again. As soon as you see that happen, click the <b>Reaction</b>
button (same button as before). If you click too early, when the
square is still yellow and the Reaction button still inactive, your
click will not be recorded.</p>

<p>Repeat the trial.  After each trial, your reaction time will be
displayed.  This is the amount of time elapsed between the moment the
square turns red and the Reaction button is clicked.  It is <b>not</b>
not the time elapsed between the two button clicks.

<p>There are ten trials in total. When you have completed them, the
button below the square will turn into an Analyze button.  By clicking
it, you can display a summary of your reaction times. On the following
pages, these data will be related to the <i>systematic error</i> and
<i>random error</i> in measuring the time interval during which the
square stays yellow.</p>
