 <div class="title"><center>Systematic Error in
 Experiments</center></div>

<p>Here is another reaction time experiment.  Imagine that you are
measuring the length of time it takes for the sound of a firecracker
to reach you from far away. This is the time elapsed between the
moment you see the explosion and the moment the sound reaches you.

<p>Click the button to light the firecracker, and click again when you
&quot;hear&quot; the sound. There will be a visual cue as to when this
happens, in the form of a large, red &quot;BANG&quot; under the
picture.</p>

<p>You can't know ahead of time when the sound will arrive at your
ears. This means your ear has to tell your brain you heard a sound,
and your brain has to tell your finger to hit the &quot;I heard it!&quot;
button.  So there will be some reaction time.</p>

<p>For comparison, the average reaction time from the color change
experiment is given along with your reaction time for the
firecracker. They should be similar -- essentially, the same mechanism
is at work inside your brain and central nervous system. These two
experiments can give you an idea about how much
<i>systematic error</i> there might be in an experiment in which you
have to operate a stopwatch.</p>
