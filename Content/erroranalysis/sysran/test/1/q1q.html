<h2>Question #1</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="q1img1.gif"></p>

<p>Identify the major source of error in each situation as either <i>systematic</i> or <i>random</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A student is measuring the length of time for a ball to drop from the roof of a building. The timer is started when the student sees the ball start to come down, and is stopped when she <i>hears</i> the ball hit the ground. (Not the best way to do this, but hey, it's possible.) She is located about 100 m from where the ball hits the ground.</p>
