<p>Be careful with the units you use. The absolute uncertainty is
given in millimeter, the height of the book in centimeter.</p>

<p>Before you even get out the calculator, though, try to estimate the
answer roughly in your head, either mathematically or by visually
picturing the size of 2 mm in comparison to 2.6 cm. A millimetre is a
tenth of a centimetre, and the coefficients (the &quot;plain
numbers&quot; in front of the units) are about the same. This suggests
that the relative error should be <i>somewhere</i> around 10%.</p>
