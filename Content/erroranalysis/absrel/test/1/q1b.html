<p>About the only thing we know for sure about this book, by using such a coarsely-divided ruler, is that it's between 2 and 3 cm high.</p>

<p>However, the trick to reading scales is to <i>estimate one more digit than is shown on the ruler</i>. This is where the uncertainty comes in -- our estimate isn't going to be exactly accurate.</p>

<p>We can see from the picture, though, that the book is somewhere around 2.5 cm high. We can improve on this by noticing that the book's height is <i>definitely</i> over the halfway mark between 2 and 3 cm... leaving only two possible choices, 2.6 cm or 2.7 cm. From here, it's your call -- how far over the halfway mark is it?</p>
