<p>This one is a judgement call. The height of the book is definitely
more than half the way to the 3 cm mark, so 2.4 cm and 2.5 cm are
out. However, the next digit might be a 6 or a 7, depending on how you
read the ruler.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the last digit quoted in any measurement is the
one that's somewhat uncertain -- it might be off by &plusmn;1,
&plusmn;2, .... .  In our example, the last digit is uncertain by
&plusmn;1.</p>
