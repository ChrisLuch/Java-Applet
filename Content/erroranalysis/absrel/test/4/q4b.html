 <p>Be careful with this one.  Two mistakes may have occurred in
 arriving at this result.</p>

 <p>First off, just as the <b>one-way</b> distance between the
 mountain tops is half the round-trip distance measured by the laser
 so is the absolute uncertainty of the one-way distance half that for
 the round-trip distance.

 <p>Then make sure you convert the final answer correctly to
 percentages by multiplying the fractional error, i.e., the ratio
 "(absolute error)/(measurement value)", by 100.
