  <div class="subtitle"><center>Absolute Error</center></div>

<p>These types of errors -- with the same units as the measured
quantity, as in the case of the applet on the left -- are called
<b>absolute errors</b> (or &quot;absolute uncertainties&quot;).  If
the length of the object is denoted <i>L</i>, then the absolute error
in <i>L</i> is denoted <font face="symbol">D</font><i>L</i>.  By
definition, an absolute error is always positive.  Compare the
comments under "Notation" on Page 1 of Errors/Basic Facts/Explain
It.</p>

<p><u>Reading scales</u>.

<p>Choosing an amount of error in a situation like that on the left
may seem a bit arbitrary to you. However, there are some guidelines
you can follow for reading scales.</p>

<p>Given ideal conditions -- the ruler is in good shape, the room is
bright, the markings are clearly visible, etc. -- a scale can be read
down to <i>one-tenth of its smallest division</i> (e.g., &#0177; 0.1
cm on a centimetre ruler). However, this is more of a judgement call
than anything. If you think you can only read the scale to within the
nearest fifth or half of a division, then go with that as your
uncertainty.</p>
