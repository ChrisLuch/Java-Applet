  <div class="subtitle"><center>Using Relative Errors</center></div>


<p>Relative errors can give you some insight into how accurate a
result really is. 

<p>For example, if you measure the distance between two cities to the
nearest metre, that's pretty good. In contrast, if you measure your
height to the nearest metre, that's terrible. 

<p>A large relative error would show up in the second measurement, but
in the first measurement the relative error would be quite small.</p>
