  <div class="subtitle"><center>Combining Types of Error</center></div>


<p>The applet on the left will take you through a series of three
questions.  After you have answered the first one correctly, the next
one will be presented.</p>  

<p>The questions deal with both absolute and relative error. You'll be
asked to calculate both, and something a little bit different in
Question 3.</p>

<p>Remember the equation

<p align="center">rel. err. = (abs. err.) / (best estimate) = <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>L</i> / <i>L</i> </p>

<p>where in the symbolic expression on the right it has been assumed
that the quantity to be measured has the symbol <i>L</i>.

<p>From this equation, you can express any of the three quantities
occurring in it in terms of the other two.  The three questions ask
you, in turn, for each of the three quantities given the other two.
