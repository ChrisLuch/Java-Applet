  <div class="subtitle"><center>Applying Abs. &amp;
  Rel. Error</center></div>

<p>The distinction between absolute and relative uncertainties has
practical consequences when calculating the uncertainties of combined
quantities.

<p>Suppose you have measured a distance traveled and a time elapsed
and have calculated the corresponding average speed by dividing
distance traveled by time elapsed.  You also have values for the
uncertainties in the distance traveled and time elapsed and want to
calculate the corresponding uncertainty in the average speed.  In a
case like this, where a ratio is involved, this is done most easily by
working with relative uncertainties.

<p>In other situations, where you need to add or subtract measurement
values, calculating the uncertainty in the sum or difference is done
most easily by using absolute uncertainties.</p>

<p>Combining uncertainties is covered under another heading:
Errors/Propagation of Error.</p>
