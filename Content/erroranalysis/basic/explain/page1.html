<p><b>Uncertainties</b>. It's something you can't escape in physics. No matter
how hard you try, no matter how good your instruments are, there will
always be some &quot;uncertainty&quot; in your measurements.</p>

<p>Since we can't get rid of uncertainties entirely, the next best
thing we can do is to <i>quantify</i> them - that is, give others an
idea of how big our uncertainties are.  You may already have seen
uncertainties in some measurement results:

<p align="center"><i>measurement result</i> = <i>best estimate</i>
&plusmn; <i>uncertainty</i>. </p>

<p>What we will be examining is this &quot;plus-or-minus&quot;
uncertainty -- how big should it be?  We will also be asking ourselves
how to obtain a best estimate.</p>

<p><b>Notation</b>.  Suppose we are measuring some quantity <i>A</i>.
Then the &quot;best estimate plus-or-minus uncertainty&quot; will be
denoted symbolically by

<p align="center"><i>A</i> &plusmn; <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>A</i>.</p>

<p><u>Comment 1</u>. The symbol <font face="symbol">D</font><i>A</i>
when used to denote an uncertainty denotes a <b>positive</b> quantity.
The symbol <font face="symbol">D</font><i>A</i> has also another use,
namely, as notation for the change in the quantity <i>A</i> during a
given time interval. Such changes, in general, may be either positive
or negative.  Thus, the symbol <font face="symbol">D</font><i>A</i>,
when used to denote an uncertainty, has a different significance than
when used to denote a change in a quantity.

<p><u>Comment 2</u>. There are different ways of quantifying an
uncertainty. The symbol <font face="symbol">D</font><i>A</i> is used
in all cases and does not make it clear how the uncertainty was
determined.  Thus, a statement like &quot;<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>A</i> = 5 cm&quot; will contain different
information, depending on how the 5-cm uncertainty has been
determined.  It needs to be made clear in the context, how exactly
<font face="symbol">D</font><i>A</i> has been determined.

<p><b>Uncertainties vs. Errors</b>. &quot;Uncertainties&quot; are also
called <i>errors</i> -- however, the term &quot;uncertainty&quot;
describes better what one is dealing with in measurements.  An
uncertainty in a measurement result is, after all, not like an error
or a mistake in a calculation.  The latter should and can be
eliminated, the former is an aspect of nature that cannot be
eliminated, although one should try to reduce uncertainties.

<p>The term &quot;error&quot; occurs in certain time-honored
combinations like &quot;absolute error&quot; and &quot;relative
error&quot;.  It would be better to refer to these as &quot;absolute
uncertainty&quot; and &quot;relative uncertainty&quot;.  You will find
the terms &quot;uncertainty&quot; and &quot;error&quot; used
interchangeably in the literature.
