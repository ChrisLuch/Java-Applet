 <li>We have calculated the sample standard deviation <i>s</i> in
 order to get a measure of the uncertainty of the individual
 measurement values.  If you round the value of 0.018 m to 0.02 m, you
 get a result that can easily be obtained by "eye-balling" the five
 measurement values in the table above.  Thus, what we have done may
 seem like cracking a walnut with a sledge hammer.  And you would be
 right in feeling this way. If only a few data points are given, there
 is little to be gained by working out the SD.  A quick estimate will
 usually be a good enough value of the uncertainty.  However, if a
 much larger number of measurement values is available, the SD will
 give a better measure of the uncertainty.  The purpose of the
 calculation done here was mainly to illustrate the procedure.

 <p>Whether, in a case like this, you obtain an uncertainty of 0.02 m
 by "eye-balling" or an uncertainty of 0.018 m by calculating the
 standard deviation, in both cases the uncertainty would be denoted
 <font face="symbol">D</font><i>L</i>, if the quantity to be measured
 is denoted by the symbol <i>L</i>.  Thus, you need to make it clear
 in the context what <font face="symbol">D</font><i>L</i> denotes,
 i.e., how <font face="symbol">D</font><i>L</i> was determined.
 Compare the section "Notation" on Page 1 of this session.</li>

<p>

 <li>An uncertainty of 0.02 m for the individual measurement values
 with a sample mean of 1.18 m amounts to a relative uncertainty of
 about 2%.  A 2%-uncertainty means that the measurement values are
 reasonably precise, but not <b>very</b> precise.  There are
 measurements that are much more precise than that.  E.g., physicists
 think that they have measured the mass of the electron to eight
 significant digits.</li>

<p>

 <li>Insofar as the measurement values are reasonably precise, they
 are also reasonably accurate.  However, accuracy requires more than a
 small scatter of individual measurement values.  It also requires
 that the mean is close to the true value.  

 <p>Suppose the tape measure that was used to measure the lengths in
 the tabulation above had the first 10 cm missing, without this being
 noticed.  This would make all measured values and their mean 10 cm
 too large.  This kind of an error is called a <i>systematic
 error</i>.  If a sizeable systematic error is present, the
 measurements would be correspondingly inaccurate even though fairly
 precise.</li>

<p>

 <li>The sample mean <i>m</i> is the best estimate of the true value,
 if no systematic errors are present.  If a systematic error is
 present, <i>m</i> may be substantially off the true value and it may
 be possible to get a better estimate of the true value by trying to
 correct for the systematic error if one has some information about
 it. </li>

<p>

 <li>Suppose you take another set of five measurements of the length
 and yet another set, etc.  Each time the sample mean will be a little
 bit different, but it will not scatter as widely as the individual
 measurement results.  If the individual measurement values are
 normally distributed, one can prove that the sample mean <i>m</i> too
 is normally distributed, with a standard deviation that is smaller
 than the SD of the individual measurement values by the factor of
 <img src="root16.gif" align="bottom"><i>n</i>.

 <p>In the example above, the SD of the sample mean,
 <i>s</i><sub>mean</sub>, would be equal to <i>s</i> /<img
 src="root16.gif" align="bottom"><i>n</i> = 0.018 /<img
 src="root16.gif" align="bottom">5 = 0.008 m.

 <p align="center"><i>s</i><sub>mean</sub> = 0.008 m .</p>

 <p>If there is no systematic error present, the five measurement
 values thus provide the following final result for the length:

 <p align="center">1.184 m &plusmn; 0.008 m</p>

 <p>where the true mean <img src="xbar.gif" align="bottom"> has a
 roughly 68% chance of being in the indicated range.

 <p>In quoting an uncertainty, make sure you indicate what the
 uncertainty means, whether it is the uncertainty in the individual
 measurement values or in the mean of these values.  There is no
 generally accepted convention that dictates which uncertainty to use
 so that the reader of your publication needs to be informed.</li>

<p>

 <li>The estimate <i>s</i> of the SD of the individual measurement
 values does not change with the sample size <i>n</i>, apart from the
 fluctuations to be expected with any change in the sample.  However,
 the estimate <i>s</i><sub>mean</sub> = <i>s</i> /<img src="root16.gif"
 align="bottom"><i>n</i> of the SD of the sample mean decreases as the
 sample size <i>n</i> increases and would eventually approach zero as
 <i>n</i> approaches infinity.

 <p>Can one make a measurement result arbitrarily accurate by going to
 larger and larger samples, at least in principle?  Of course, there
 are practical limits to how often one can repeat a measurement.

 <p>No, one cannot.  E.g., one cannot go significantly farther in
 reducing the uncertainty than we have done here, simply by measuring
 more often.  The final result quoted above already goes one decimal
 beyond the precision with which the individual measurement values are
 quoted.  Going two decimals beyond this precision by increasing
 <i>n</i> would give a misleading impression of the accuracy of the
 result.  The reason is that there is no assurance that there will not
 be a systematic error of the order of at least a few tenths of a
 centimeter inherent in the measuring procedure if the procedure can
 provide length values only to within 1 cm.</li>
