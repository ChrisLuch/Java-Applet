 <div class="title">Max/Min Method</div> 

<p>The applet illustrates an example of a kind of problem that arises
frequently in error analysis: One has measured some quantities and
determined their uncertainties and then wants to calculate other
quantities from the measured ones and wants to know the uncertainties
of the calculated quantities.  In the case of the applet, there is
only one measured quantity, the radius, and only one calculated
quantity, the area of the circle.

<p>The task of determining the error in a calculated quantity from
given errors in measured quantities is called <i>error
propagation</i>.

<p>The easiest way of handling error propagation is to use the
<b>max/min method</b>.  This is the method used in the applet.  One
simply determines the largest and smallest values of the calculated
quantity that are possible given the uncertainty ranges of the
measured quantities.
