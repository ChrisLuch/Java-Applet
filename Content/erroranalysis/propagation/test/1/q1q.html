<p><img src="running.gif" width="107" height="130" align="right">A sprinter is running a 200 m race. She is being measured with an old-fashioned stopwatch, one that is accurate down to the nearest second.</p>

<p>If her time is read off the dial as 27.3 seconds, given how accurate the stopwatch is, what is closest to the <b>relative uncertainty</b> in her time?</p>

<li>0.005</li>
<li>0.1 s</li>
<li>273</li>
<li>5%</li>
</ol>
