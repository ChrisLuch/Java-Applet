    <div class="title">Collisions In Two Dimensions</div> 

    <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates a collision between an incoming
    object and an object that is initially stationary.  The impact
    parameter of the incoming object can be set to a non-zero value which
    results in both objects moving away from the collision axis after the
    collision.  The collision can be viewed both in the laboratory frame
    of reference and the center-of-mass frame of reference.
