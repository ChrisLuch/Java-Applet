 <div class="title">Collisions In Two Dimensions</div> 

 <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates a collision between an incoming
 object and an object that is initially stationary.  The impact
 parameter of the incoming object can be set to a non-zero value which
 results in both objects moving away from the collision axis after the
 collision.  The collision can be viewed both in the laboratory frame
 of reference and the center-of-mass frame of reference.
