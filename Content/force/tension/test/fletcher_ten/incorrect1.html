  <p>No, the tension is not equal to 3.9 N, which is the weight of
  block 2.</p>

  <p>You may wish to review the answer to Force/Tension/Test
  Yourself/Fletcher Tension 2 where it is explained that the tension
  is smaller than the weight of block 2.  That explanation goes part
  of the way towards finding the answer to the present question.</p>
