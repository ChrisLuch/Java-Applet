  <div class="title">String Tension in Fletcher's Trolley</div>

  <p align="center"><img src="fletcherbare.jpg"></p>

  <p>The apparatus shown above is known as Fletcher's Trolley.  The
  apparatus is assumed to be without dissipative friction, and it is
  assumed that the string connecting the two blocks cannot stretch.
  The pulley and the string are assumed to be massless.  </p>

  <p>The mass of block 1 is 0.60 kg and the mass of block 2 is 0.40
  kg.  For the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity, take the
  value <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>

  <p>While the blocks are moving, what is the tension in the
  string?  Enter your answer in newton below.</p>
