<center><b>Variable Tension</b></center>

<p>The weight of the rope is set to 30 N.  The tension <i>T</i>
increases as one goes up the rope, from 0 at the bottom to 30 N at the
top.  At the point shown here, the tension is 9.0 N.  Let's call this
point P.  The tension at P is equal to the weight <i>w</i> of the
portion of the rope below P.

<p>Reason: The subsidiary diagram shows the entire portion of the rope
below point P.  The magnitude of the upward force <i>F</i> acting at P
on this portion of the rope is equal to the tension at P.  Since the
rope is at rest, <i>F</i> must balance <i>w</i>, by Newton's second
law.  Therefore the tension at P is equal to w.

<p>How large is <i>w</i>?  If the length of the portion below P is <i>y</i>
and the total length of the rope is <i>L</i>, then <i>w</i> is equal
to the fraction <i>y</i>/<i>L</i> of the total weight <i>W</i> of the
rope.  Thus,

<p><center><i>T</i> = <i>w</i> = (<i>y</i>/<i>L</i>)<i>W</i>
.</center>

<p>With <i>T</i> = 9.0 N and <i>W</i> = 30 N, this tells us that

<p><center><i>y</i>/<i>L</i>  =  9/30  =  0.3 </center>

<p>so that the point at which the tension is 9.0 N is 30% up from the
bottom of the rope.
