    <center><h3>Tension - What is It?</h3></center>

    <p>To find the tension in a rope, we first need to define what we
    <b>mean</b> by tension.

    <p>Let us do this for the vertical rope on the left before returning
      to the horizontal case.

    <p>A crate is suspended by a <b>massless</b> rope.  You can vary the
    crate's weight by moving the slider.

    <p>You can check what the internal forces are in the rope at any point
    in the rope by dragging the arrow pointing to the rope upward or
    downward.  To see what the forces are at this point, <b>click the
    scissors icon</b>.

    <p>This will give you an enlarged view of the rope at this point with
    a 'virtual cut', which is an <b>imagined</b> line dividing the rope
    into two portions.  The simulation shows the forces exerted on the
    bottom portion by the top portion and exerted on the top portion by
    the bottom portion.  The point where each force is acting is shown by
    a dot at the tail end of the force vector.

    <p>Examine these forces at several points along the rope, and also at
    the end points where the rope is attached to the ceiling and to the
    crate.  <b>Try to explain</b> what you observe in terms of Newton's
    laws.  Then go on to the discussion on the next page.
