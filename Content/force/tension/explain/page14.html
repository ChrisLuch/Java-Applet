        <center><b>Derivation of T/F = m/M</b></center>

        <p>In the equation in the title of this page, <i>T</i> is the tension
        in one of the strings and <i>m</i> is the combined mass of all blocks
        'behind' that string.  <i>M</i> =
        <i>m<sub>1</sub></i>+<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>+<i>m<sub>3</sub></i> is the
        total mass of all three blocks, and F is the forward force applied to
        the system.

        <p>Let us assume there is friction between the blocks and the surface
        they slide on.  To make things simple, the simulation is designed so
        that all blocks have the same coefficient of friction, <font
        face="symbol">m</font>, and that <font face="symbol">m</font> has the
        same value in the static and kinetic cases. Also, the acceleration due
        to gravity, <i>g</i>, is taken to have the value 10.0 m
        s<sup>-2</sup>.

        <p>When the system is in motion, the total friction force acting on
        the system has a magnitude of <font face="symbol">m</font><i>Mg</i>.
        Since the friction force is opposite to the applied force <i>F</i>,
        Newton's second law applied to the entire system gives

        <p><center><i>F</i> - <font face="symbol">m</font><i>Mg</i> =
        <i>Ma</i></center>

        whence

        <center><i>F</i> = <i>M</i> [<i>a</i> + <font
        face="symbol">m</font><i>g</i>] .</center>

        <p>Exactly the same kind of reasoning leads to an analogous expression
        for the tension in, say, the middle string,

        <p><center><i>T<sub>2</sub></i> =
        (<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>+<i>m<sub>3</sub></i>) [<i>a</i> + <font
        face="symbol">m</font><i>g</i>] .</center>

        <p>One just has to replace <i>F</i> by <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> and
        <i>M</i> by <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>+<i>m<sub>3</sub></i>.  The idea is
        that the subsystem consisting of the last two blocks has a forward
        force acting on it equal to the tension <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>, just as
        the entire system of three blocks is pulled by the force <i>F</i>, and
        a retarding force equal to the combined friction force acting on the
        last two blocks, <font
        face="symbol">m</font>(<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>+<i>m<sub>3</sub></i>)<i>g</i>.

        <p>Dividing the left-hand and right-hand sides of the equations for
        <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>F</i> gives the desired result,

        <center><i>T<sub>2</sub></i>/<i>F</i> =
        (<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>+<i>m<sub>3</sub></i>)/<i>M</i>.</center>

        <p>It may surprise you that according to this the tension is
        independent of the coefficient of friction.  Does that makes sense?  

        <p>Here is a reason.  The tension increases from 0 to F from the rear
        end to the front end of the chain in proportion to the amount of mass
        that lies behind the point at which the tension is evaluated.  There
        is no room for friction in this proportion.  E.g., it cannot possibly
        be true that, because of friction, the tension is greater everywhere
        by a certain factor, because then the tension at the front end of the
        chain would be greater than F, which is impossible.
