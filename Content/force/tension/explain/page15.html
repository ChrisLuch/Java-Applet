        <center><b>Experimenting with Tension</b></center>

        <p>The simulation is set so that no external force is applied the
        system and the system is at rest.  The coefficient of friction <font
        face="symbol">m</font> is set to 0.05.  (You can change this value.
        Let's assume this value in the following.)

        <p>All three tensions are equal to zero.  Gradually <b>increase the
        force</b> applied to the system (by dragging the front string).
        Observe how the tensions change.  At first, only the tension in the
        string to which the force is applied changes.  The reason why the
        other two tensions remain equal to zero at first is that the static
        friction acting on the first block increases with the applied force
        and keeps the first block at rest.  No help is needed from the middle
        string to keep the block at rest.

        <p>Only when the applied force <i>F</i> exceeds the maximum magnitude
        <font face="symbol">m</font><i>m<sub>1</sub>g</i> of the static
        friction force that can be exerted on the first block, does tension in
        the middle string start to develop.

        <p>This way, the three strings gradually 'take up slack' as the
        applied force <i>F</i> increases.  The system starts to move only when
        the tension in the last string exceeds the maximum magnitude <font
        face="symbol">m</font><i>m<sub>3</sub>g</i> of the static friction
        force that can be exerted on the last block.  If that block has a mass
        of 20 kg, this tension must exceed <font
        face="symbol">m</font><i>m<sub>3</sub>g</i> = 0.05x20x10 = 10 N.

        <p><b>Experiment</b> with the simulation and try to <b>explain what
        you observe</b>.  Note that the simulation is designed so that the
        applied force, once it has been increased to a value at which the
        system accelerates, can be decreased only to a value equal to the
        magnitude of the friction force.  At this point the system moves with
        constant velocity.  To look again at what happens for a smaller
        applied force, you need to first reset the simulation.
