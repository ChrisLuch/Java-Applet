    <center><b>Tension - What Is It?</b></center>

    <p>The crate's weight is set to 300 N.  At the dividing line of the
    rope, there is an upward 300-N force exerted on the lower portion of
    the rope.  This force is necessary to hold up everything below the
    point where the force is acting, namely, the massless lower portion of
    the rope and the 300-N crate.

    <p>The reason why the magnitude of this upward force must be 300 N
    lies in Newton's <b>second</b> law.  The subsidiary diagram shows the
    system to which we apply this law.  The system consists of the
    massless lower portion of the rope and the crate.

    <p>The net force acting on the system in the subsidiary diagram must
    be zero, by Newton's second law, if the system is to remain at rest.
    This will be the case only if the upward force exerted at the dividing
    line on the lower portion of the rope has a magnitude of 300 N, so
    that it can balance the downward 300-N weight force acting on the
    system.

    <p>There is a second force acting at the dividing line whose direction
    is <b>downward</b>.  This force acts on the upper portion of the rope
    and is exerted on it by the lower portion.  The two forces acting on
    the two ends of rope at opposite sides of the dividing line are an
    action-reaction force pair.  The two forces in this pair, by Newton's
    <b>third</b> law, are opposite in direction and equal in magnitude.
    Here, their common magnitude is 300 N.  It is this magnitude of 300 N
    that one calls the <i>tension</i> in the rope at this point.

    <blockquote>

      <p>The <i>tension T</i> in the rope at the dividing line is
        <b>defined</b> as the <b>magnitude</b> of either one of the forces
        acting on the two portions of rope at this point.

    </blockquote>

    <p>Intuitively, the tension at a point in a rope describes how hard
    the two portions of the rope that are joined at that point are pulling
    on each other.

    <p>Here, <i>T</i> = 300 N at all points of the rope.
