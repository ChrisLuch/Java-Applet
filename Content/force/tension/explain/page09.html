        <center><b>Variable Tension</b></center>

        <p>In the last example, the tension was <b>not</b> the same
        everywhere.  Here we have another example where the tension is
        variable, a <b>massive</b> rope suspended from a ceiling.  The tension
        is due to the gravitational forces acting on the various parts of the
        rope.

        <p>Use the slider to set the weight of the rope to the value you want.
        Then move the arrow to the point in the rope where you want to test
        the tension and click the scissors icon.

        <p><b>Try to explain</b> how the tension varies with position, using
        Newton's second law.  Then go on to the next page and compare.
