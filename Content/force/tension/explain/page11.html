        <center><b>Tension in a Dynamic Situation</b></center>

        <p>The examples on the preceding pages were about tension in static
        situations.  The simulation above illustrates tension in a non-static
        situation.

        <p>You can vary the masses of the blocks via the three sliders on the
        left.  You can apply a force to the 'train' of blocks by dragging the
        front end of the front string to the right. The train will accelerate.
        The three tension dials show the tensions in the three strings.  The
        strings are assumed to be <b>massless</b>.

        <p>You can watch the motion either from the Lab frame (LF) or the
        frame in which the blocks are at rest (BF) by clicking either the LF
        or BF button.  You can freeze the motion by clicking the PAUSE/PLAY
        button.  The tensions will continue to be displayed as before.

        <p>Vary the masses and the applied force and observe the changes in
        the tensions.  Can you explain the tension values in terms of Newton's
        laws applied to the system?  Please note that in the present
        simulation the blocks have <b>no friction</b>.
