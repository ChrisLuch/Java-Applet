<b><center>Tension - What Is It?</center></b>

<p>The horizontal case shown here corresponds to the tug-of-war situation
  from Page 1. There, we had a rope that had a 1300-N force applied at
  its left end pulling to the left and another 1300-N force at the
  right end pulling to the right.  Here, the common magnitude of these
  forces can be adjusted by the slider.  Again, 'cut' the rope at
  various points along its length.

<p>What do you conclude about the forces exerted at any point along
  the rope by one piece of rope on the other?  And about their
  magnitudes, the tension?

<p>So - the tension is the same everywhere along the rope, and it is
  equal to the magnitude of <b>one</b> of the external forces applied
  to the rope at its ends.  If there is a 300-N force applied to the
  rope at the left end and an opposite 300-N force applied to the rope
  at the right end, the tension in the rope is <b>300 N</b>.

<p><b>In the tug-of-war example from Page 1, the tension in the rope
  between the teams is 1300 N.</b>
