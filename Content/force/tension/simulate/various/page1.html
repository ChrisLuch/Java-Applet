        <center><h2>Tension Simulations</h2></center>

        <p><b>Preparation</b>:  Force/Tension/Explain It.

        <p>On the next page you can access the five simulations from the session named above.

        <ul>

        <li><u>Vertical Rope</u>.  Tension at different points in a massless
        rope.  The rope is suspended from a ceiling and holds up a crate of
        variable mass.</li>

        <li><u>Vertical Massive Rope</u>.  Tension at different points in a
        massive rope suspended from a ceiling.  The mass of the rope can be
        varied.</li>

        <li><u>Tug of War</u>.  Tension at different points in a horizontal
        stationary rope that has several forces applied to it at either
        end.</li>

        <li><u>Horizontal Rope</u>.  Tension at different points in a
        horizontal stationary rope.  The rope has a single force applied to it
        at either end whose magnitude can be varied.</li>

        <li><u>Train Demo</u>.  The tensions in the strings connecting three
        blocks pulled on a horizontal surface by an applied force.  The system
        can have friction.  The applied force, the masses of the blocks, and
        the friction coefficients can be varied.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>For explanations of how to use the simulations, please go to
