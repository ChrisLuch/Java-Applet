<div class="title">Activities on Tension in Fletcher's Trolley</div>

 <p>
   The following Activities on string tension are for the Fletcher's
   Trolley applet.  Make sure you know how the applet functions by
   consulting Help, Assumptions, and ShowMe under Applet Help on the
   applet's Help menu.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>Activity 1</b>.  This Activity is for the case of negligible
  pulley mass.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  The mass of Block 1 is not
   variable in the applet and equal to 600 g.  Set the mass of Block 2
   to 400 g and the mass of the pulley to 0.
 </p>
 <p>
   The applet uses for the magnitude <i>g</i> of the acceleration due
   to gravity the value 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.  Using this value,
   calculate the weight of Block 2, the block suspended from the
   pulley.  Compare this weight to the tensions <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>
   and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> in the ends of string attached to Blocks 1
   and 2, respectively, when the system is held at rest.  The values
   of the tensions are displayed in the Data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Continuing from Exercise 1, display the
   free-body diagrams for the two blocks.  Observe the lengths of the
   force vectors labeled <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and
   <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>.  Then release Block 1 (by Playing the motion)
   and observe <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> during
   the motion.  To make this easier, Pause the motion before Block 2
   reaches the platform at the bottom.  Are the tensions when the
   system is in motion different from when the system is held at rest?
   If so, are they larger or smaller when the system is in motion?  
 </p>
 <p>
	Do the ends of string attached to Blocks 1 and 2 still have equal
   tensions when the system is in motion, as they did when the system
   was held at rest?
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 3</b>.  For the mass values in Exercises 1 and 2,
   calculate the tension in the string when the system is in motion,
   and compare your value to that displayed in the data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 4</b>.  Repeat Exercises 1 to 3 for a different value
   of the mass of Block 2.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 5</b>.  Derive an expression for the tension in the
   string in terms of the masses <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> and
   <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> of the blocks and the magnitude <i>g</i> of
   the acceleration due to gravity when the system is moving.  The
   expression should involve symbols only, not numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 2</b>.  This Activity investigates qualitatively
   whether the the tensions in the ends of string attached to Blocks 1
   and 2 are affected by the mass of the pulley.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  Set the mass of Block 2
   to 400 g and the mass of the pulley to 1.00 kg.
 </p>
 <p>
   Compare the weight of Block 2 to the tensions <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>
   and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> in the string on the sides of the pulley
   attached to Blocks 1 and 2, respectively, when the system is held
   at rest.  The values of the tensions are displayed in the Data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Continuing from Exercise 1, display the
   free-body diagrams for the two blocks.  Observe the lengths of the
   force vectors labeled <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and
   <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>.  The two tensions should be equal as long as
   the system is held at rest.
 </p>
 <p>
	Release Block 1 (by Playing the motion), and observe
   <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> during the motion.
   To make this easier, Pause the motion before Block 2 reaches the
   platform at the bottom.  Do the ends of string attached to Blocks 1
   and 2 still have equal tensions when the system is in motion, as
   they did when the system was held at rest?  If not, which tension
   is larger and how do the two tensions compare to the tension when
   the system is at rest?
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 3</b>.  Repeat Exercises 1 and 2 for a different value
   of the pulley mass.  Would you expect the new pulley mass to lead
   to tension values larger or smaller than those for the old pulley
   mass?  Do your observations agree with your expectation?
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Exercise 4</b>.  Attempt to explain your observations in
   Exercises 1 to 3 qualitatively.
