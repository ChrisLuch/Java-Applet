  <div class="title">The Gravitational Force Exerted on a Planet by the Sun</div>

  <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the motion of a planet around the
  sun (or another fixed star), or the motion of a moon or satellite
  around a planet.</p>  

  <p>For detailed information on how to use the applet, go to Applet
  Help on the applet's Help menu and look at Help and ShowMe.  A
  Lesson accompanying the applet is available there as well.
  </p>

  <p>Note that the applet only exhibit's the planet's acceleration.
  The gravitational force exerted by the sun on the planet is in the
  same direction as this acceleration and has a magnitude equal to
  <i>ma</i> where <i>m</i> is the planet's mass and <i>a</i> the
  magnitude of the planet's acceleration.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Activities" under Related Items suggests investigations to be
    carried out with the applet on the gravitational force exerted by
    the sun on the planet.
