    <p>The Applet on Page 2 shows projectile motion in a uniform
    gravitational force field (force field of constant magnitude and
    direction near the surface of the earth). The projectile's kinetic
    and potential energies are represented by an energy column.

    <p>Detailed information on how to use the applet is available from
    Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
