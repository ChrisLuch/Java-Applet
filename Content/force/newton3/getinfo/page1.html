  <p><blockquote>If an object A exerts a force <img src="F.gif"
  align="bottom"> on another object B, then object B exerts a force on
  object A equal to -<img src="F.gif" align="bottom">.</blockquote>

  <p><u>Comment 1</u>.  Forces are the result of interactions between
  <b>pairs</b> of objects.  The interaction between a pair of objects
  always gives rise to <b>two</b> forces that are equal in magnitude
  and opposite in direction. One of these forces acts on one of the
  objects, the other force acts on the other object.  In Newton's
  words, as translated by I.B. Cohen and A. Whitman "If anyone presses
  a stone with a finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone."

  <p><u>Comment 2</u>.  Newton's third law is sometimes summarized by
  the glib phrase "action is equal to reaction".  If the statement is
  not carefully explained, it can be interpreted in all kinds of ways,
  most of which different from what is intended in Newton's third law.
  Nevertheless, for brevity's sake, the term <i>reaction force</i>
  will be used occasionally to refer to the Newton's-third-law partner
  of a given force.

  <p>By "reaction force" to a given force one always refers to the
  partner of the force that results from the <b>same</b> interaction
  between the two objects as the given force.  

  <p>E.g., if a book rests on a table as in the illustration below, 

  <p align="center">
    <img src="NewtonIIIBook.jpg" alt="Book on Table">
  </p>

  <p>there are two forces acting on the book: the downward
  gravitational force exerted on the book by the earth and the upward
  normal force exerted by the table on the book.  Although these
  forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction in the given
  situation, they are <b>not</b> an action-reaction force pair
  because they arise from different interactions: the gravitational
  force from the gravitational interaction between the book and the
  earth and the normal force from the molecular interaction between
  the molecules in the top layer of the table and the bottom layer of
  the book.
