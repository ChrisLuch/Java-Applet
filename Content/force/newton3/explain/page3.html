<p align="center"><b>Newton's Third Law</b>

<p>On the first two pages, Newton's Third Law is demonstrated with
<b>contact</b> forces.  Here, this law is demonstrated for two objects
interacting via the <b>long-range</b> gravitational force.

<p>The simulation shows two objects interacting gravitationally.  The
gravitational force acting on each object is indicated by an arrow.

<p>Click START, and watch how the two gravitational forces change
during the motion.  You can stop the motion at any point.

<p>Repeat the experiment with a different mass ratio after adjusting
the mass ratio with the slider.
