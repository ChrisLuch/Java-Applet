<p align="center"><b>Newton's Third Law</b>

<p>The gravitational forces acting on the two objects are equal to
each other at all times, although they are steadily increasing during
the motion.  You may want to repeat the experiment and stop the motion
to compare the magnitudes of the two forces at that instant.

<p>Also, <b>both</b> objects are accelerating.  This shows that each
object has a force exerted on it.

<p><b>Task</b>: Adjust the slider position so that one object is
larger than the other one and repeat the experiment.  Which object has
the larger acceleration?
