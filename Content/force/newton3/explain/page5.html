<p align="center"><b>Newton's Third Law</b>

<p>The larger object has the smaller acceleration.  It's really the
mass, not the size, that is important, but the objects here are
assumed to have the same mass density, which means that the larger
object also has more mass.

<p>It follows from Newton's <b>Second</b> Law that F<sub>1</sub> =
m<sub>1</sub>a<sub>1</sub> where a<sub>1</sub> is the magnitude of the
acceleration of object 1.  An analogous equation holds for object 2.
Together with Newton's <b>Third</b> Law, which requires F<sub>1</sub>
= F<sub>2</sub>, it follows that

<p align="center">m<sub>1</sub>a<sub>1</sub> =
m<sub>2</sub>a<sub>2</sub>,

<p>at every instant during the motion.  Thus, at every instant,

<p align="center">a<sub>1</sub>/a<sub>2</sub> =
m<sub>2</sub>/m<sub>1</sub>.

<p>Thus, if m<sub>1</sub>/m<sub>2</sub> > 1, i.e., if object 1 has the
greater mass, then a<sub>1</sub>/a<sub>2</sub> =
m<sub>2</sub>/m<sub>1</sub> < 1, i.e., object 1 has the smaller
acceleration.  Do the experiment and verify this.

<p>Intuitively, this makes a lot of sense.  Can you think of an
example from daily life that illustrates this?
