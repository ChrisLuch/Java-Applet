<p align="center"><b>Newton's Third Law</b>

<p><b>Question</b>: Does the simulation really show that the force
exerted by skater A on skater B have the same magnitude as the force
exerted by skater B on skater A?  After all, the skaters end up moving
away from each other with different speeds.  (And so do the two
blocks.)

<p><b>Answer</b>: The forces act on the two objects (either skaters or
blocks) for the same amount of time, while the objects are in contact
with each other.  During this time, the objects accelerate.
Subsequently, they move with constant velocities.

<p>If the forces act for the same amount of time, and if the objects
are at rest initially, Newton's <b>Second</b> Law implies the
following equation relating the final speeds:

<p><center>m<sub>A</sub>v<sub>A</sub> = m<sub>B</sub>v<sub>B</sub>.</center>

<p>Here v denotes final speed and m mass, and the subscripts "A" and
"B" refer to objects A and B, respectively.  For details on the
equation, see Force/Impulse/Explain It and
Momentum/Conservation/Explain It.

<p>The masses of the two objects in the simulation (skaters or blocks)
are in the ratio 2:1.  You will agree that the corresponding final
speeds may well be in the ratio 1:2.  Thus, the equation is satisfied,
indicating that the two objects exert forces of equal magnitude on
each other; and in opposite directions, obviously.
