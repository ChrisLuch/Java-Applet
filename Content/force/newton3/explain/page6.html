<p align="center"><b>Newton's Third Law</b>

<p>The equation

<p align="center">a<sub>1</sub>/a<sub>2</sub> =
m<sub>2</sub>/m<sub>1</sub>

<p>implies that the acceleration of object 1 becomes very, very small
if the mass of object 1 becomes very much larger than the mass of
object 2.

<p>The simulation on the left illustrates this.  In this case, object
1 is the earth and object 2 is an apple.  You can only see a tiny part
of the earth, the part right under the apple tree.  Click START and
watch the motions of the apple and the earth resulting from their
gravitational interaction.

<p>The apple accelerates downward towards the earth, but the upward
acceleration of the earth is not noticeable, because the mass of the
earth is so much larger than that of the apple.

<p>Nevertheless, as the simulation on Pages 2 to 5 shows, the apple
exerts a gravitational force on the earth that is equal in magnitude
to the gravitational force that the earth exerts on the apple.  If the
apple weighs 2 N, it exerts an upward 2-N force on the earth.  You can
imagine this force to be acting at the center of the earth.

<p>The gravitational forces that the apple and the earth are exerting
on each other are an action-reaction pair of forces.
