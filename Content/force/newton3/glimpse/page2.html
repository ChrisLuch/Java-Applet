<p align="center"><b>Newton's Third Law</b>

<p>Physicists like to simplify things.  Select SHOW BLOCKS for a
simpler set-up illustrating the same principle as the two skaters.
Then click START.

<p><b>Observation</b>: When the springs between the blocks are
released, both blocks move away from their initial positions in
opposite directions.  

<p>The more massive block moves less fast than the less massive block.
The same was true for the two skaters.  Select SHOW SKATERS to view
the skaters' motion once more.

<p>In the case of the blocks, it is clearly not a matter of one block <b>wanting</b> to push the other one.
