  <p>
    The applet is on Page 2.  It shows two planets in head-on
        motion. The applet displays the gravitational forces the planets
        exert on each other and shows how the speeds, momenta, and
        kinetic energies of the two planets, and the potential energy
        and total mechanical energy of the system vary during the
        motion.

    Detailed information on how the applet functions is available under
    Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.  A lesson on Newton's third
    law and related topics, with exercises to be performed with the
    applet, is available there as well.
