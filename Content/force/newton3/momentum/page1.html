 <p>
  The applet is on Page 2.  It shows two planets in head-on
      motion. The applet displays the gravitational forces the planets
      exert on each other and shows how the speeds, momenta, and
      kinetic energies of the two planets, and the potential energy
      and total mechanical energy of the system vary during the
      motion.

   Detailed information on how the applet functions is available under
   Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.  A lesson on Newton's third
   law and related topics, with exercises to be performed with the
   applet, is available there as well.
