  <p>Newton's <b>First Law of Motion</b>:</p>

  <blockquote>Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or
  of moving uniformly straight forward, except in so far as it is
  compelled to change its state by forces impressed.</blockquote>

  <p>(Translated from the original Latin by I.E. Cohen and
  A. Whitman.)</p>
