        <div class="title">Motion On An Accelerating Incline</div>

        <p>The applet on Page 2 shows the motion of a block on an incline
        with or without friction.  The incline is either at rest or
        accelerating horizontally.  The forces acting on the block and three
        accelerations relevant to this situation can be displayed.

        <p>The motion can be observed either in the Lab or the Ramp (Incline)
        frame.  The latter is a non-inertial frame when the incline is
        accelerating, and the corresponding fictitious force acting on the
        block can be displayed.

        <p>Details on how to use the applet are available under Applet Help on
        the applet's Help menu.
