      The applet on Page 2 shows forces acting on the parts of a system
      consisting of a box on a table which is standing on the earth and the
      free-body diagrams for the box, the table, and the earth.  The
      system is pictured below.  Of course, the three parts of the system
      are not illustrated to scale.

      Detailed information on how the applet functions is available under
      Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.

      See "Activities" under Related Items for suggestions on
      investigations on forces and free-body diagrams to be carried out
      with the applet.

      The applet also shows the Newton's-third-law reaction forces to the
      forces acting in the system, but these are dealt with elsewhere,
      namely, at Force/Newton's Third Law/Simulate It/Box on Table.
