<div class="title">(d) Constant Velocity Motion</div>

<p>
 When you PLAY the motion, the red particle moves with constant speed
 in a straight line.  One also says that it moves with constant
 <i>velocity</i>.
</p>

<p>
 The particle is <b>not</b> interacting with anything.
</p>

<p>
 People did not always think of constant-velocity motions as
 interactionless.  They thought that some agent (force) was required
 to keep things moving, even with constant velocity.
</p>

<p>
 Observations from daily life support this kind of thinking. Wherever
 we see a motion with constant velocity it is maintained by some kind
 of an agent.  Think of cars.  Don't they require an engine to keep
 them moving with constant velocity?
</p>

<p>
 The Aristotelean view that an agent (interaction) is required to
 maintain a constant-velocity motion was generally accepted for almost
 2000 years until the sixteenth century AD when it was challenged by
 Galileo.  Galileo proposed a law of inertia that stated a contrary
 view: an object rolling on a perfectly smooth earth would keep on
 rolling forever, unless acted upon by some agent.
