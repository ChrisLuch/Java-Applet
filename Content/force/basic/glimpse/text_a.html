<div class="title">(a) Circular Motion</div>


<p>
 The red particle is interacting with a larger yellow object.  When
 you PLAY the motion, you can observe that while the red particle is
 performing circular motion, the yellow object is performing another
 circular motion with a much smaller radius.
</p>
<p>
 This kind of motion can be observed when a planet (red) is revolving
 around the sun (yellow).  The planet and the sun are <b>interacting
 gravitationally</b>, and while the sun exerts a gravitational force
 on the planet the planet in turn exerts a gravitational force on the
 sun.
</p>
<p>
 <u>Comment</u>.  In reality, the motion of the sun would be much less
 than that shown here because the sun is so much more massive than a
 planet. Also, the orbits of planets are slightly elliptical, not
 circular as shown here, and the sun's orbit is non-circular as well.
