        <div class="title">(a) Circular Motion</div>


        <p>
        The red particle is interacting with a larger yellow object.  When
        you PLAY the motion, you can observe that while the red particle is
        performing circular motion, the yellow object is performing another
        circular motion with a much smaller radius.
        </p>
        <p>
        This kind of motion can be observed when a planet (red) is revolving
        around the sun (yellow).  The planet and the sun are <b>interacting
        gravitationally</b>, and while the sun exerts a gravitational force
        on the planet the planet in turn exerts a gravitational force on the
        sun.
        </p>
        <p>
        <u>Comment</u>.  In reality, the motion of the sun would be much less
        than that shown here because the sun is so much more massive than a
        planet. Also, the orbits of planets are slightly elliptical, not
        circular as shown here, and the sun's orbit is non-circular as well.
