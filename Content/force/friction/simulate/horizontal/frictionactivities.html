<div class="title">Activities on Static and Kinetic Friction Between a
Block and a Horizontal Table</div>

 <p>
   The following Activities are for the Static and Kinetic Friction
   applet.  Make sure you know how the applet functions by consulting
   Help, Assumptions, and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's
   Help menu.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 1</b>.  The purpose of Activity 1 is to determine the
   static coefficient of friction <font
   face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub> between the block and the table.
 </p>
 <p>
   RESET the applet. Set the static coefficient of friction to 0.30.
   Pretend you don't know this value and want to determine it
   'experimentally' with the applet.  Do so as follows.
 </p>
 <p>
   Increase the magnitude of the force applied to the block until the
   block's acceleration becomes non-zero.  Keep the direction of the
   applied force horizontal.  What is the magnitude of the (static)
   friction force just before the block's acceleration becomes
   non-zero?  The information is available from the data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   Remember that the static coefficient of friction <font
   face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub> determines the maximum magnitude
   of the static friction force via
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>F<sub>fric,max</sub></i> = <font
   face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub> <i>N</i> <img
   src="small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40">(1)
 </p>
 <p>
   where <i>N</i> is the magnitude of the normal force.  An equation
   for the magnitude of the nomal force can be obtained by applying
   Newton's second law in the <i>y</i>-direction (vertical direction)
   to the block.  When the applied force is horizontal, only the
   normal force and the force of gravity acting on the block have a
   non-zero <i>y</i>-component.  Since <i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = 0,
   Newton's seond law implies that
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>N</i> - <i>mg</i> = 0 <img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space"
   height="1" width="40">(2)
 </p>
   whence
 <p align="center">
   <i>N</i> = <i>mg</i> .<img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space"
   height="1" width="40">(3)
 </p>
 <p>
   Here, <i>m</i> is the mass of the block and <i>g</i> the magnitude
   of the acceleration due to gravity, which is taken to be equal to
   9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> in the applet.
 </p>
 <p>
   Substitute Expression (3) for <i>N</i> into Eq.(1), and use the
   resulting equation with the given and observed values to calculate
   <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub>.  Compare your result to
   the value set earlier with the slider.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 2</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is to determine
   the kinetic coefficient of friction.
 </p>
 <p>
   Continue with the applet in the same state as in Activity 1, i.e.,
   with <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub> = 0.30 and the data
   box open.  Determine the kinetic coefficient of friction <font
   face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub> as follows.
 </p>
 <p>
   Adjust the magnitude of the applied force so that it is just enough
   to cause the block's acceleration to be non-zero.  This should be
   at <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i> = 14.8 N if the applied force is
   horizontal.  Make sure the force is horizontal.  PLAY/STEP the
   motion up to <i>t</i> = 2.00 s and PAUSE at this time.
 </p>
 <p>
	From the block's displacement in 2.00 s, determine the block's
	acceleration using the equation relating displacement,
	acceleration, and time elapsed for motion with constant
	acceleration.  Compare your result with the value of
	<i>a<sub>x</sub></i> in the data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   Apply Newton's second law to the block to calculate the
   <i>x</i>-component of the net force acting on the block,
   <i>F<sub>x</sub></i>, from the acceleration and the mass of the
   block.  From this and the value of <i>F<sub>appl,x</sub></i>,
   calculate the value of the <i>x</i>-component of the friction
   force, <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i>.  Compare your result with the
   value in the data box.  There may be a slight difference due to
   round-off.
 </p>
 <p>
   Since the block is moving in this case, we are dealing with kinetic
   friction.  Use the equation defining the coefficient of kinetic
   friction <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub>,
 </p>
 <p align="center"> 
   <i>F<sub>fric</sub></i> = <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub>
   <i>N</i>, <img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
   width="40">(4)
 </p>
 <p>
   combined with Expression (3) for <i>N</i> to calculate <font
   face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub>.  Compare your result with the
   value to which the Kinetic Coefficient of Friction slider is set.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 3</b>.  The purpose of this activity is to investigate
   if the force of kinetic friction and the kinetic coefficient of
   friction depend on the applied force.
 </p>
 <p>
   REWIND the applet, and set the magnitude of the applied force to
   20.0 N.  Keep the applied force horizontal.
 </p>
 <p>
   Again determine the force of kinetic friction and the kinetic
   coefficient of friction, using the same procedure as in Activity 2.
   Are the results the same as before?
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 4</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is to determine if
   the magnitude of the force of kinetic friction is proportional to
   the magnitude <i>N</i> of the normal force or to the weight
   <i>F<sub>grav</sub></i> = <i>mg</i> of the block.
 </p>
 <p>
   In order to distinguish between <i>N</i> and
   <i>F<sub>grav</sub></i>, we must set up a situation in which the
   two quantities have different values.
 </p>
 <p>
   To do so, set the magnitude of the applied force to 15.0 N and the
   direction angle <font face="symbol">q</font> of the applied force
   to 30<sup>o</sup>.  Both from the data box and the free-body
   diagram, you can see that <i>N</i> < <i>F<sub>grav</sub></i> in
   this case.  This time, we'll pretend we know the kinetic
   coefficient of friction: 0.24.  Make sure the slider is set to this
   value.  However, let's pretend we just don't know whether to
   multiply it by <i>N</i> or <i>mg</i> to get the magnitude of the
   force of kinetic friction.
 </p>
 <p>
   As in Activity 1, derive an expression for <i>N</i> by applying
   Newton's second law to the block.  Again, the vertical component
   <i>a<sub>y</sub></i> of the acceleration is 0.  Thus, as in Eq.(2),
   the sum of the <i>y</i>-components of all forces acting on the
   block is 0.  However, in the present case, there are three, not
   two, forces that have a non-zero <i>y</i>-component.  The applied
   force is the third one.  Thus, with <i>F<sub>appl,y</sub></i> =
   <i>F<sub>appl</sub> sin</i> <font face="symbol">q</font>,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>N</i> - <i>mg</i> + <i>F<sub>appl</sub> sin</i> <font
   face="symbol">q</font> = 0<img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space"
   height="1" width="40">(5)
 </p>
   whence
 <p align="center">
   <i>N</i> = <i>mg</i> - <i>F<sub>appl</sub> sin</i> <font
   face="symbol">q</font>.<img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space"
   height="1" width="40">(6)
 </p>
 <p>
   Calculate <i>N</i> from Eq.(6), and compare the result to the value
   in the data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   Then use Eq.(4) to calculate the magnitude of the force of kinetic
   friction.  Is the result consistent with the value of
   <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i> displayed in the data box?  
 </p>
 <p>
   Now calculate the block's acceleration <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> by
   applying Newton's second law to the block,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
    <i>F<sub>appl,x</sub></i> + <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i> =
   <i>F<sub>appl</sub> sin</i> <font face="symbol">q</font> - <font
   face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub> <i>N</i> =
   <i>ma<sub>x</sub></i>.<img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space"
   height="1" width="40">(7)
 </p>
 <p>
   Substitute the given values into Eq.(7), and calculate
   <i>a<sub>x</sub></i>.  Does the result agree with the value in the
   data box?
 </p>
 <p>
   Predict the block's displacement <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> during a time interval of 2.00 s.
   Then PLAY the applet, and check if your prediction agrees with the
   displacement you observe.  If it does, then using <i>N</i> rather
   than <i>mg</i> in Expression (4) for the magnitude of the force of
   kinetic friction is the right thing to do.  Using <i>mg</i> instead
   of <i>N</i> in this expression would have resulted in a different
   value for <font face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i>.  You may want to do
   the calculation.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 5</b>.  Design an experiment, to be carried out with
   the applet, that let's you decide whether Expression (1) for the
   maximum magnitude of the force of static friction should have
   <i>N</i> or <i>F<sub>grav</sub></i> on the right-hand side
   multiplying <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub>.
 </p>
 <p>
   Carry out the experiment.
