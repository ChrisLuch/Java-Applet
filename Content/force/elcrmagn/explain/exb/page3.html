        <p>Again, there is a uniform electric field in the plane of the screen.

        <p>Adjust the electric field vector so that it points straight down,
        and make sure the charge is positive.  Adjust the initial velocity so
        that it points upward and to the right in a roughly 45-degree
        direction.  Then click PLAY.  You should be able to observe a motion
        that looks exactly like projectile motion of a massive particle in the
        earth's gravitational field.

        <p>You can pause the motion, repeat it, step through it, and display
        or hide the trace.  

        <p>After clicking PLAY, always click PAUSE and then RESET if you want
        to change any of the parameters.
