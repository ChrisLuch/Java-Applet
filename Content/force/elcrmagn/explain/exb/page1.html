        <p align="center"><b>Electric and Magnetic Forces</b>

        <p align="left">The forces experienced by a charged particle in
        electric and magnetic fields are quite different.

        <p>The simulation lets you observe the motion of a charged particle
        when either only an electric or a magnetic field is present or when
        both fields are present at the same time.

        <p>Let's start with the situation when only an electric field is
        present.  Thus, set the magnetic field to zero by moving the B-slider in the
        control panel to the zero position.  Then click the START button.
