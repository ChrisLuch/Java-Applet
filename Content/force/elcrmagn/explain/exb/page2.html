<p align="center"><b>Electric and Magnetic Forces</b>

<p>The magnetic field is now set to zero.  There is a uniform electric
field whose direction is in the plane of the screen.  You can vary the
electric field by dragging the tip of the <b>E</b>-vector.  Do this
and observe the resulting motion.  Then PAUSE the motion and click the
RESET button.

<p>You can vary several more things: 

<ul>

<li>the initial velocity (green
arrow; drag the tip of the arrow)</li> 

<li>the sign of the charge and the magnitude of the charge-to-mass
ratio of the moving particle</li>

<li>the
number of particles (1, 2, or 12; all particles are identical).</li>  

</ul>
