        <p align="center"><b>Electric and Magnetic Forces</b>

        <p>The magnetic field is now set to zero.  There is a uniform electric
        field whose direction is in the plane of the screen.  You can vary the
        electric field by dragging the tip of the <b>E</b>-vector.  Do this
        and observe the resulting motion.  Then PAUSE the motion and click the
        RESET button.

        <p>You can vary several more things: 

        <ul>

        <li>the initial velocity (green
        arrow; drag the tip of the arrow)</li> 

        <li>the sign of the charge and the magnitude of the charge-to-mass
        ratio of the moving particle</li>

        <li>the
        number of particles (1, 2, or 12; all particles are identical).</li>  

        </ul>
