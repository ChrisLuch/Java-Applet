<div class="title">Charged Particle In A Magnetic Field</div>

<p><b>Preparation</b>: Force/Electromagnetic/Explain It/Magnetic
Force.</p>

<p>The applet on Page 2 simulates a magnetic field that is uniform
throughout the applet window.  The direction of the field can be
chosen to be perpendicular to the plane of the screen or in the plane
of the screen. If perpendicular to the screen, the direction is
indicated either by circled dots or X's, depending on whether the
direction is towards the viewer or into the screen.  If the direction
is in the screen, it is indicated by small grey arrows.</p>

<p>The field magnitude can be changed by means of a slider and the
field direction can be changed by a 4-step toggle button.</p>

<p>The black dot represents a charged particle whose initial velocity
is set to be to the right.  The magnitude of the initial velocity can
be adjusted by means of a slider.  The particle's initial position can
be changed by dragging the dot.</p>

<p>In addition, the following quantities can be controlled by means of
either toggle buttons or sliders:</p>

<ul>

<li>magnitude and sign of the charge</li>

<li>particle mass</li>

<li>display of the particle trace (on or off)</li>

</ul>

<p>The radius of the particle's orbit is printed on the screen.</p>

<p>One can run the simulation either continuously or step through it,
by selecting the appropriate button.</p>

<p>The Reset and Restart buttons reset the applet to its default
setting or to the setting arranged by the user at the beginning of the
motion, respectively.</p>

<p>The applet is designed to allow only a choice among discrete values
of charge, mass, speed, and magnetic field, for easier numerical
comparisons.  These values are in unspecified units.</p>
