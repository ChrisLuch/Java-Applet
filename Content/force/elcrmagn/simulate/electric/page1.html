<div class="title">One or Several Charged Particles In An Electric
Field</div>

<p><b>Preparation</b>: Force/Electromagnetic/Explain It/Electric
Force.</p>

<p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the motion of a charged particle in
a uniform electric field.  The applet can also simulate simultaneous
motions of two or twelve charged particles.

<p>For details on how to use the applet, please go to Applet Help on
