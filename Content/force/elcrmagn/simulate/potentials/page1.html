  <div class="title">Electric Potential in a Uniform Electric Field</div>

  <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the electric potential at a given
  point in a uniform electric field.  It displays the electric field
  line and line of constant potential through the given point.  It also
  simulates the potential energy of a charged particle in the field
  and illustrates energy conservation during the particle's motion.

  <p>Details on how to use the applet are available under Applet Help
  on the applet's Help menu.
