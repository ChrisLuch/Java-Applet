        <div class="title">Electric Potential in a Non-uniform Electric Field</div>

        <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the electric potential at a given
        point in a non-uniform electric field (the field due to a point
        source) and displays the electric field line and line of constant
        potential through the given point.  It also simulates the potential
        energy of a charged particle in the field and illustrates energy
        conservation during the particle's motion.

        <p>Details on how to use the applet are available under Applet Help
        on the applet's Help menu.
