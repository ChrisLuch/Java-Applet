 <div class="title">Block on Springs</div>

 <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the forces acting on a vertically
  acceleratinging block.  The block is supported by springs that in
  turn are resting on a platform.  The platform can move upward or
  downward.  The situation simulated by the applet is analogous to
  that of a person standing on a bathroom scale in an accelerating
  elevator.

 <p>The system can be viewed both in the inertial Lab frame and the
 non-inertial CM frame.  The free-body diagrams corresponding to each
 frame can be displayed.

 <p>For detailed information on how to use the applet, please go to
 Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.  A Lesson on the normal force
 is also available from the Help menu.
