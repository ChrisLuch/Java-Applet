        <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the forces acting on a vertically
        acceleratinging block.  The block is supported by springs that in
        turn are resting on a platform.  The platform can move upward or
        downward.  The situation simulated by the applet is analogous to
        that of a person standing on a bathroom scale in an accelerating
        elevator.

        <p>The system can be viewed both in the inertial Lab frame and the
        non-inertial CM frame.  The free-body diagrams corresponding to each
        frame can be displayed.

        <p>For detailed information on how to use the applet, please go to
        Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.  A Lesson on the normal force
        is also available from the Help menu.
