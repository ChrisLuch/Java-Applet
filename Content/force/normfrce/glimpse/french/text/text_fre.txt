The magnitude of this force is the block's "<font color="#008000">weight</font>" (<font color="#008000">W</font>).<b>Step 2</b>When the block rests on the table, the table exerts an upward force on the block.  This force acts on the bottom of the block.  It is a contact force because it is non-zero only when the block is in contact with the table.  The force is called "<font color="#0000FF">normal force</font>" (<font color="#0000FF">N</font>) because it is perpendicular to the surface of contact between the table and the block and "normal" means "perpendicular".<b>Step 3</b>The two forces acting on the block are opposite in direction, but equal in magnitude, therfore <font color="#0000FF">N</font> %3D <font color="#008000">W</font>.<b>Step 5</b>The free-body diagram on the right shows all forces acting on the block.  The normal force is opposite to the gravitational force and the two forces are equal in magnitude.  Therefore, the vector sum (the net force) of the two forces is equal to zero, i.e., <font color="#0000FF">N</font> %2B <font color="#008000">W</font> = 0.<b>Question:</b> Why is the vector sum (the net force) equal to zero?<b>Answer:</b> The block is at rest, and therefore its acceleration is zero.  By Newton's second law, the net force acting on the block is equal to the block's mass times its acceleration (F<font size="6">net</font> = ma).  If the block's acceleration is zero, the net force acting on the block must also be zero.  This is only possible if the normal and gravitational forces acting on the block are opposite in direction and equal in magnitude, i.e., <font color="#0000FF">N</font> = <font color="#008000">W</font>.&Page #2&page21=<b>Step 1</b>What is the physical nature of the normal force?  Is it a single force, acting at the midpoint on the bottom of the block, as suggested by the single blue vector?  <i>Zoom in and have a closer look.</i><br><br><b>Step 2</b>In reality, there are many smaller normal force vectors distributed uniformly over the bottom surface of the block. Because of this distribution of the normal force over a surface, the normal force is called a "surface force".  In contrast, the gravitational force is distributed throughout the volume of the block and is therefore called a "volume force".  This is indicated by numerous small green force vectors acting on different parts of the block.<b>Step 3</b>The sum of the smaller normal force vectors is equal to the total normal force of magnitude <font color="#0000FF">N</font>.<b>Step 4</b>Similarly, the sum of the smaller gravitational forces is equal to the total gravitational force of maganitude <font color="#008000">W</font>.<b>Question:</b> Is <font color="#0000FF">N</font> always equal in magnitude to <font color="#008000">W</font>, in all situations?  <b>Answer:</b> No! On the next page you will see why.&Page #3&page31=<b>Step 1</b>Apply an additional downward contact force of magnitude (<b>F</b>) on the block, by placing a weight on the block. <b>Question:</b> What happens to the size of the normal force acting on the bottom surface of the block?<b>Answer:</b> When the weight is placed on the block, the normal force increases in size.  Why?  And by how much does the size of the normal force increase?<b>Explanation:</b> The block is at rest, and its acceleration is therefore zero.  Newton's second law (F<font size="6">net</font> = ma) implies that the vector sum of the three forces acting on the block must also be zero.Given the directions of the three forces, this implies <font color="#0000FF">N</font> %3D <font color="#008000">W</font> %2B F.  Thus, the normal force acting on the block is larger than the weight of just the block alone, i.e., <font color="#0000FF">N</font> %3E <font color="#008000">W</font>.<b>Moral:</b> The magnitude of the normal force <font color="#0000FF">N</font> is not given by a single expression that applies in all situations, but must be determined in every case by an application of Newton's second law.&Page #4&page41=<b>Step 1</b><br><br><b>Question:</b> What is the physical origin of the normal force?  What enables the table to push upward on the block?<i>Zoom in to the molecular level.</i><br><br><b>Step 2</b>The round balls represent molecules in the block and the table at the surfaces facing each other. At the instant shown in Step 2, the block is not quite in contact with the table yet. Watch what happens when the block makes contact with the table surface.<b>Step 3</b>Notice the compression in the top layers of the table molecules as the block makes total contact with the table.  The upper layers of the table are compressed like a spring (or like a mattress).  This compression is not visible to the naked eye. As a result of the compression, the table molecules exert upward forces on the molecules in the bottom layer of the block.  These are the normal forces exerted by the table on the block.  They are indicated by the small blue arrows.  Like all intermolecular forces, these normal forces are electromagnetic in nature.There are also downward forces acting on the table, but these are not shown.The wavy lines separating the block and table molecules symbolize the electromagnetic fields in this area. There are also fields internally within the block and within the table, but these are not illustrated here.<b>Step 4</b><br><br><b>Question:</b> What will happen when you place an extra weight on the block?<b>Step 5</b><br><br><b>Answer:</b> When an extra weight is placed on the block, the upper layers of the table molecules are compressed even further.  As a result, the normal forces exerted by the table on the block increase.  The size of the normal forces are determined by the amount of compression in the table surface.  This compression depends on whatever physical conditions may be present.  The compression is probably a damped oscillation (not simulated here) when the weight is first lowered onto the table, with the normal forces oscillating correspondingly. <i>Vary the weight with the slider</i>, and observe how the normal forces change as the compression of the table changes.  Newton's second law (F<font size="6">net</font> = ma), applied to the block, implies that when the block is resting on the table in equilibrium the magnitude of the total normal force <font color="#0000FF">N</font> is given by the equation <font color="#0000FF">N</font> %3D <font color="#008000">W</font> %2B F, where F is the magnitude of the force applied by the extra weight to the block.&Page #5&page51=<b>Step 1</b>The block is now in contact with the table so that the table can exert a contact force on the block.  This force has in general two components: one is the normal force (<font color="#0000FF">N</font>) which is perpendicular to the contact surface and the second is the friction force (<font color="#FF0000">F<font size="6">friction</font></font>) which is parallel to the surface. <i>To view the friction force drag the hand to the side of the block.</i><br><br><b>Step 2</b><br><br><i>Adjust the pushing force (F<font size="6">applied</font>) using the slider.</i>As long as the block stays at rest, the friction force (<font color="#FF0000">F<font size="6">friction</font></font>) is opposite to the applied force (F<font size="6">applied</font>) and its magnitude varies in order to be equal to that of the applied force.Again, Newton's second law (F<font size="6">net</font> = ma) demands that when the block is at rest, the acceleration and net force are both zero.  This is only possible if the horizontal applied force is balanced by a horizontal friction force opposite in direction and equal in magnitude.Note that the friction force will not grow indefinitely with the applied force.  There is a point beyond which the friction force will not grow.  If the applied force increases further, the block will begin to accelerate.& &page61=<b>Step 1</b>This will be page 6 text.& &summary=There is a gravitational force exerted on an object by the earth and it is equal in magnitude to its weight (W). When an object rests on a horizontal surface, the surface exerts an upward force on the object.  This force acts on the bottom surface of the object, perpendicular to the contact surface and is referred to as the normal force (N). According to Newton's second law, if the object does not accelerate then the vector sum of the weight and normal force is zero.  Therefore, the normal force and weight are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.The normal force is a contact force, distributed uniformly across the bottom surface of an object.  The gravitational force (weight), on the other hand, is a volume force distributed uniformly throughout the object.The magnitude of the normal force (N) is not given by a single expression that applies in all situations, but must be determined in every case by an application of Newton's second law.The normal force is related to the amount of compression in the supporting surface molecules.The friction force (F<font size="6">friction</font>) is also a contact force, but one which acts parallel to the contact surfaces.  Furthermore, if a horizontal applied force (F<font size="6">applied</font>) acts on an object that does not accelerate then the friction force must be acting in the opposite direction with equal magnitude.  Varying the magnitude of the applied force results in a matching variation in the friction force.  However, the friction force cannot grow indefinitely if the magnitude of the applied force continues to increase.  If the magnitude of the applied force exceeds the maximum friction force the obje ct will begin to accelerate.&&loadedCheck=done&
