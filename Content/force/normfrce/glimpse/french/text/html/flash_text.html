At the instant shown in Step 2, the block is not quite in contact with the table yet. Watch what happens when the block makes contact with the table surface.<br><b><br>Step 3<br></b><br>Notice the compression in the top layers of the table molecules as the block makes total contact with the table. The upper layers of the table are compressed like a spring (or like a mattress). This compression is not visible to the naked eye. <br><br>As a result of the compression, the table molecules exert upward forces on the molecules in the bottom layer of the block. These are the normal forces exerted by the table on the block. They are indicated by the small blue arrows.

When an object rests on a horizontal surface, the surface exerts an upward force on the object. This force acts on the bottom surface of the object, perpendicular to the contact surface and is referred to as the normal force (<font color="#0000FF">N</font>). According to Newton's Second Law (<img border="0" src="image2.gif" align="top" width="70" height="22">) , if the object does not accelerate then the vector sum of the weight and normal force is zero.

Furthermore, if a horizontal applied force (<b>F<sub>applied</sub></b>) acts on an object that does not accelerate then the friction force must be acting in the opposite direction with equal magnitude. Varying the magnitude of the applied force results in a matching variation in the friction force. However, the friction force cannot grow indefinitely if the magnitude of the applied force continues to increase. If the magnitude of the applied force exceeds the maximum friction force the object will begin to accelerate.</font></p><hr color="#E2DDBA" size="4"><p align="right"><a href="#top">top...</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
