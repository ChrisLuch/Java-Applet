  <div class="title">Normal Force</div>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>

<ul>

<li>When an object is in vertical accelerated motion, the normal force
acting on the object is <b>not</b> equal in magnitude to the weight of the
object.  The normal force can be calculated by applying Newton's
<b>second</b> law to the object.</li>

<p>

<li>If an object rests on a bathroom scale in an accelerating
elevator, the scale measures the normal force applied by the scale to
the object, not the object's weight.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Experiment</b> with the simulation and see if you can predict
what you observe.  Predict the value of <i>N</i> when the 2.0-kg
object moves with</p>

<p>
<ul>

<li>downward acceleration and downward velocity,</li>

<li>downward acceleration and upward velocity,</li>

<li>upward acceleration and downward velocity,</li>

<li>upward acceleration and upward velocity.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can set the acceleration and initial velocity with the data
entry fields.  Place the cursor in front of the digit you want to
change and then either type the new value or use the up and down
keys.</p>
