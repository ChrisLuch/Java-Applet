  <div class="title">Normal Force</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The so-called 'weight' shown by the bathroom scale
is really the normal force exerted by the scale on whatever object is
resting on the scale.  </p>

<p>If the object is a 2.0-kg object and the scale and object have an
upward 2.0-m s<sup>-2</sup> acceleration, this normal force has a
magnitude of 23.6 N.  (If the object's mass is 60 kg, the magnitude of
the normal force under the same conditions is 708 N.)</p>

<p>Although ordinary bathroom scales measure <b>forces</b>, they are
not calibrated in newton, but in kilogram (or sometimes in lb, but
let's assume kg here).  They show a kind of <i>equivalent mass</i>,
<i>m<sub>equ</sub></i>, equal to the normal force divided by the
magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity, <i>g</i> = 9.8 m
s<sup>-2</sup>. For a 60-kg object with a 2.0-m s<sup>-2</sup> upward
acceleration,</p>

<div class="equation"><i>m<sub>equ</sub></i> = <i>N</i>/<i>g</i> =
708/9.8 = 72.2 kg.</div>

<p>Of course, the true mass of an object does not depend on the
acceleration, but the equivalent mass does because it is a really a
normal force, calibrated in terms of mass.  For an explanation of why
it is the normal force that is measured by a bathroom scale and how to
calculate the normal force, go on to the next few pages.</p>
