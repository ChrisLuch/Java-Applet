<div class="title">Acceleration in Fletcher's Trolley</div>

<p>The third equation is the equality of the two tensions,</p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="15"><i>T<sub>1</sub></i> =
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> = <i>T</i>,<spacer type="horizontal" size="15">(3)

<p>where the symbol <i>T</i> has been introduced to denote the common
value of the two tensions.  The tensions in a string on the two sides
of a massless, frictionless pulley are equal, by the pulley
theorem.</p>

<p><u>Step 4</u>.  We now need to 'turn the crank' and solve the
equations.  Setting <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> =
<i>T</i> in equations (1) and (2) leaves us with two equations for the
two unknowns <i>a</i> and <i>T</i>.  Try to solve these equations
yourself before going on to Page 5.</p>
