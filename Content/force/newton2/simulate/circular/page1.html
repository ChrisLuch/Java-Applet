      Net Force In Circular Motion
    </div>

    <p>An applet simulating the net force acting on a particle moving in a
    circle is on Page 2.  Motions with either constant or non-constant
    speed are possible.  The applet simulates the radial (centripetal) and
    tangential components of the net force, as well as the position,
    velocity, and acceleration vectors and the radial and tangential
    components of the acceleration vector.

    <p>For details on how the applet functions and a guided tour of the
    applet in the form of exercises go to Applet Help on the applet's Help
    menu. Select the Help and ShowMe documents, respectively.
