    <div class="title">Timer Stopwatch</div>

    <p>The applet is on Page 2.  Details on how to use it are available
    under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.

    <p>The applet simulates both a stopwatch and a timer, with minimal delay
    between clicking the Start/Stop button and the response of the clock.

    <p>In the Forward mode, the clock runs forward and simulates a
    stopwatch.  In the Backward mode, the clock runs backward and
    simulates a timer.
