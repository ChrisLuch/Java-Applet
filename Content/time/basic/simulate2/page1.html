  <div class="title">Timer Stopwatch</div>

<p>The applet is on Page 2.  Details on how to use it are available
under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.

<p>The applet simulates both a stopwatch and a timer, with minimal delay
between clicking the Start/Stop button and the response of the clock.

<p>In the Forward mode, the clock runs forward and simulates a
stopwatch.  In the Backward mode, the clock runs backward and
simulates a timer.
