    <p>The applets and Flash animations listed below are part of the MAP

    tutorial at
    <a href="https://modularphysics.mtroyal.ca/">https://modularphysics.mtroyal.ca</a> 
    They can be used at the high-school,
    and first and second-year university levels. The work is underway to update them for use 
    with the current internet browsers. The applets which have been updated are 
    indicated by the word “updated” in the parentheses besides their name.  

    <p>A password may be required to
    access the MAP tutorial.  Please get in touch with Hans Laue
    (hlaue@ucalgary.ca) if you require the password.  The listing below
    provides direct links (without password protection)
    to individual applets and FLASH animations from the MAP tutorial.  
    It indicates where in the MAP tutorial the items were used. 
    Also, their current web addresses are indicated if they have been updated. </p>

    <p>All materials in the MAP tutorial or in the listing below are
    copyright protected.  Please get in touch with ----------- if you wish
    to use any of these materials for any purpose other than personal
    viewing.</p>

    <p>The applets were designed to be viewed using the CANU Navigator, 
    the content navigation utility of the MAP system.  
    Since the links in the present file do not access the applets via the CANU Navigator, 
    some of the applets may not get displayed automatically when you click on the link.  
    The link may take you to a directory instead.  In this case, click on the file "applet.html" 
    (or, perhaps, "page2.html") in the directory to display the applet.</p>

    <p>Most applets have a Help menu to provide information on how to use
    the applet.  To access this information, pull down the Help menu and
    go to Applet Help.  For some applets, Applet Help still
    has to be made available on the Help menu.  The listing below
    indicates if an applet has Applet Help information available.</p>

    <p>In general, the information available from a Help menu under Applet
    Help consists of several files, named <i>Help</i>, <i>Assumptions</i>,
    <i>ShowMe</i>, and <i>Lesson</i>.</p>

    <ul>

      <li><i>Help</i> provides information on how to use the applet.</li>

      <li><i>Assumptions</i> spells out the physical assumptions
      underlying the applet.</li>

      <li><i>ShowMe</i> is a guided tour through the applet in the form of
      exercises.</li>

      <li><i>Lesson</i> contains a number of exercises to be carried out
      with the applet that illustrate what can be learned with the
      applet.</li>

    and Interaction</a>.  Item consists of four separate applets and text
    showing an object carrying out four different motions: one motion that

    The applets can help draw attention to the fact that interactions are
    related to acceleration and that one needs to study acceleration.</p>

      the acceleration exceeds a certain value, the point at which the
      normal force would be acting is beyond the base of the block and the
      block topples.  The block's initial velocity can be varied as well and
      can be seen not to affect the block's toppling.</p>

      <a href="https://modularphysics.mtroyal.ca/map/Content/torque/newton2rot/applyit/skidding/">Skidding Wheel</a>
      The applet simulates the skidding and rolling motion of a
      wheel that is propelled onto a horizontal track.  The buttons need to
      be adjusted, but their tool tips can be read.</p>

    <p>The track's friction can be varied.  The initial speed of the wheel
    can be varied.  The wheel skids at first and then starts rolling.  One
    can study how long it takes for the wheel to change from skidding to
    rolling as a function of the initial speed of the wheel and
    coefficient of kinetic friction between the wheel and the track.  The
    path of a point on the wheel can be displayed and be seen to change
    shape as the wheel goes from skidding to rolling.</p>

      <a href="https://modularphysics.mtroyal.ca/map/Content/torque/newton2rot/applyit/broom/"> Balancing A Broom</a>
      The applet simulates an accelerating person who is trying to
      balance a broom on his outstretched hand.  The person's acceleration
      and the position of his hand can be varied.</p>

    <p>The buttons need to be adjusted, but the tool tips can be read.</p>

      *<a href="https://modularphysics.mtroyal.ca/map/Content/circuitbuilder/basic/simulate/practice/">Electric Circuit Lab</a>.
      Applet allows construction of electric circuits containing
      batteries, resistors, light bulbs, switches, ammeters and voltmeters.
      The parameters, like battery emf's and internal resistances,
      resistance values, etc., can be set to arbitrary values.  The applet
      calculates all relevant quantities in the various branches of the
      circuit: currents, potential differences, potentials at a point, power
      dissippated.  More than one circuit can be constructed
      simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>The applet has Help, Assumptions, ShowMe, and Lesson documentation
    under Applet Help on its Help menu.</p>
