    <h2><center>Physics Applets And Flash Animations</center></h2>

    <h3><center>Calgary, Alberta, January 19, 2023</center></h3>

    </font>

    <p>The Java applets and animations listed below were initially designed as part 
    of a project titled <b>Modular Approach to Physics</b> by the Calgary Team, which was 
    part of a collaboration of Alberta physicists. They can be used at the high 
    school and first and second-year university levels for non-commercial purposes. 
    The work is underway to update them for current internet browsers. The 
    applets/animations which have been updated are indicated by the word "updated" 
    in the parentheses beside their name. The animations have been converted from Flash 
    to mp4. </p>

    <p>Some applets may not be displayed automatically when you click on the link. 
    The link may take you to a directory instead. In this case, click on the file 
    "applet.html" (or, perhaps, "page2.html") in the directory to display the applet. </p>

    <p>Most applets have a Help menu to provide information on how to use the applet. 
    To access this information, pull down the Help menu and go to Applet Help. For some 
    applets, Applet Help still has to be made available on the Help menu. The listing 
    below indicates if an applet has Applet Help information available.</p>

    <p>The information available from a Help menu under Applet Help generally consists 
    of several files named <i>Help</i>, <i>Assumptions</i>, <i>ShowMe</i>, and 
    <i>Lesson</i>.</p>

    <ul>

      <li><i>Help</i> provides information on how to use the applet.</li>

      <li><i>Assumptions</i> spells out the physical assumptions
      underlying the applet.</li>

      <li><i>ShowMe</i> is a guided tour through the applet in the form of
      exercises.</li>

      <li><i>Lesson</i> contains several exercises to be carried out with 
      the applet that illustrates what can be learned with the applet.</li>

        involves no interaction with another object, three motions that do.
        The applets can help draw attention to the fact that interactions are
        related to acceleration and that one needs to study acceleration.</p>

          axes can be rotated by dragging the tips of the axes.  This
          demonstrates the position vector's dependence on the choice of origin
          and the dependence of the vector's scalar components on the

          The applet displays the work done on a ball
          while the ball is moving subject to a force.  The force acting on the
          particle can be controlled by dragging a force vector.  The motion can
          be replayed and gone through step-by-step, both forward and backward.
          The work done in each step is calculated and the kinetic energies at
          the beginning and end of the step displayed.  Students can verify that
          the work done is equal to the kinetic energy change in each step.
          Forces and displacements necessary to calculate the work done are
          printed out.  The initial velocity vector can be dragged out of the
          ball, and the ball can be dragged to a suitable initial position.  The
          applet can be run in 1D or 2D.</p>

          Collection of five applets.  The first applet
          simulates qualitative aspects of the concept of a torque about an
          axis, and the remaining four illustrate four different ways of
          calculating the torque about an axis.</p>

          <p>In all five applets the forces can be varied in magnitude and direction
          by dragging the tips of the force vectors.  The point at which a force
          is acting can be changed by dragging the force vector somewhere other
          than at its end points, and the location of the rotation axis can be
          changed by dragging as well.</p>

          <p>The qualitative applet is intended to show the sense of rotation
          induced by the acting force(s) and the net torque is displayed at
          every instant of the motion.  The motion is not realistic in the sense
          that it proceeds with constnt angular velocity.  The motion stops when
          the net torque is zero.  (The applet seems to malfunction when it is

        Lets you choose between five different applets all simulating tension
        in various situations.  In the first four applets, the arrow can be
        dragged to choose the point in the rope at which one wants to find the
        forces between the two ends of the rope joined at that point.
        Clicking on the scissors will produce a 'virtual' cut that is supposed
        to indicate that the rope has two ends that are exerting forces on
        each other at this point.  The fifth simulation shows the tension in
        ropes connecting blocks that can be dragged by a horizontal applied
        force and that are subject to friction.</p>

        of Tension</a>.  A 15-page lesson explaining tension in a string. The 
        preceding five applets are used. Some show the forces at a cross section 
        through the string chosen by the user. The last one shows the tensions in 
        the strings connecting three blocks that are being dragged over a 
        horizontal surface. The latter can be run with or without friction.</p>
