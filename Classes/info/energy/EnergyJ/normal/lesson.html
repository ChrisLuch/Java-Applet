properties of energy</div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p><b>Prerequisites</b>

<p>Students should have some experience with physical systems, and
knowing the expressions for the kinetic energy of a particle and the
potential energy of a particle near the surface of the earth would be
helpful.

<p><b>Learning Outcomes</b>

<p>Students will develop an understanding of five basic properties of
energy:

<p><ul>

<li>there are different kinds of energy;</li>

<li>energy is an additive quantity;</li>

<li>the different kinds of energy can be transformed into each other,
but the total energy of an isolated system remains the same during
such transformations;</li>

<li>energy can be moved into and out of a system;</li>

<li>energy is a scalar quantity.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Instructions</b>

<p>Students should know how the applet functions, as described in Help
and ShowMe.

<p>The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in the
following text are to be done in the applet. You may need to toggle
back and forth between instructions and applet if your screen space is
limited.

  <p>Energy is a very abstract quantity.  One of the most widely
  applicable principles of physics is the <b>Principle of Energy
  Conservation</b>.

  <p>The principle says that any physical system has something called
  energy and that, as long as the system is isolated, the value of the
  energy stays the same no matter what may be happening in the system.
  Being isolated means that the system is not interacting with
  anything outside the system.  ("Energy" means "total energy" here.)

  <p>This quantity may take very different forms.  E.g., a particle of
  mass <i>m</i> and speed <i>v</i> has energy in the form of kinetic
  energy.  The kinetic energy <i>KE</i> is equal to
  
  <p align="center"><i>KE</i> = &frac12;<i>mv</i><sup>2</sup>. <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (1)</p>

  <p>Another example is the potential energy of a system consisting of
  a particle of mass <i>m</i> and the earth.  If the particle is near
  the surface of the earth, this system has potential energy
  <i>PE</i> equal to

  <p align="center"><i>PE</i> = <i>mgh</i> <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (2)</p>

  <p>where <i>h</i> is the elevation of the particle above the earth's
  surface and <i>g</i> is the magnitude of the acceleration due to
  gravity.

  <p>These are two very different looking energy expressions.  There
  are many others.  The principle of energy conservation asserts that,
  no matter what system one is dealing with, one can always find
  energy expressions for the system such that the total energy of the
  system is conserved, if the system is isolated.

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>.  Suppose there is an isolated system that has
  only potential and kinetic energy.  At time <i>t</i> =
  <i>t<sub>1</sub></i>, these energies are equal to
  <i>PE<sub>1</sub></i> = 10 J and <i>KE<sub>1</sub></i> = 4 J,
  respectively.  At another time <i>t</i> = <i>t<sub>2</sub></i>, the
  potential energy is equal to <i>PE<sub>2</sub></i> = 2 J.  What is
  the kinetic energy <i>KE<sub>2</sub></i> at this moment?

  <p>Although different systems can have different kinds of energy,
  all energies have some properties in common.  The applet can
  illustrate five of these.  This illustration implements a model of
  energy invented by R.P. Feynman and described in the book by
  R.P. Feynman, R.B. Leighton, M. Sands, <u>The Feynman Lectures on
  Physics, vol. 1</u>.  Feynman is comparing energy to colored
  building blocks with which a child is playing in a room.  The child
  can repaint the blocks, can throw blocks out of the window, etc.

<p><div class="sectionheading"><a name = "KindsofEnergy">Different
  Kinds of Energy</a></div>

  <p>The applet shows a physical system as a white rectangle with a
  border around it.  This particular system has two kinds of energy,
  potential and kinetic, symbolized by blue and red blocks.

  <p>Other systems may have other forms of energy: chemical, nuclear,
  thermal, electromagnetic, etc.

  <p>Energy comes in different forms.  Different mathematical
  expressions are used to express different energies in terms of system
  properties.

  <p><b>Exercise 2</b>.  Consider a system consisting of the earth and
  a shotput.  The shotput has mass 4 kg and a speed of 5 m/s when it
  is 3 m above the ground, what are the kinetic and potential energies
  of this system?  Use Expressions (1) and (2) above with <i>g</i> =
  9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<p><div class="sectionheading"><a name = "Adding">Energies Can Be
Added</a></div>

  <p>If a system has parts that have separate energies, or if some
  parts have several kinds of energy, all these energies can be added
  to give the total energy of the system.

  <p><b>Exercise 3</b>.  What is the total energy of the system in
  Exercise 2?

  <p>Not all physical quantities have the additivity property.  Can
  you think of one that does not have this property?  What about
  temperature?  Does it make sense to add the temperatures in
  different rooms of a building?  Does it make sense to add the
  energies present in different rooms of a building?


<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<p><div class="sectionheading"><a name = "Transformation">Transforming
  One Kind Of Energy Into Another and Energy Conservation</a></div>

  <p>Double-click on a blue block.  It changes into a red block.  1 J
  of potential energy has been transformed into 1 J of kinetic energy.
  The sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the system, i.e.,
  the total energy of the system, has not changed. The total energy of
  an isolated system is conserved.

  <p>You can use this property to make the following kind of
  prediction.  Suppose that initially your system has 25 blocks and
  that you are not letting the system interact with its environment.
  Now trnsform the colors of some of the blocks until you have 10 red
  blocks.  How many blue blocks do you predict will be in the system?
  Check it with the applet.

  <p><b>Exercise 4</b>.  Suppose your system is the system from
  Exercise 2.  Assume that the system is isolated.  What is the
  system's kinetic energy when the shotput is 1 m above the ground?
  Would you be able to work out the speed of the shotput from this
  value?

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<p><div class="sectionheading"><a name = "EnergyTransfer">Energy
Transfer</a></div>

  <p>A system that is not isolated can have energy transferred into it
  or out of it.  In the process, the system's energy changes, but the
  total energy of the system and its environment does not.  One can
  think of the system and its environment as a larger isolated system.

  <p><b>Exercise 5</b>. Transfer 4 J of energy out of the system and
  then transfer 3 J of energy back into the system.  Observe the
  changes in the three kinds of energy simulated by the applet,
  represented by red, blue, and green blocks.  Does the combined
  energy of the system plus environment remain the same?

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<p><div class="sectionheading"><a name = "EnergyScalar">Energy Is A
Scalar</a></div>

  <p>The number of blocks in the applet is a scalar quantity.  So is
  energy a scalar quantity.

  <p>Energy does <b>not</b> have direction.  One might think that
  kinetic energy should have a direction, the direction in which the
  particle is moving.  However, this is not how energy is defined.
  There are other forms of energy, e.g., potential energy or chemical
  energy (energy stored in a battery) that definitely don't have direction.

  <p>If one kind of energy does not have direction, then another kind
  cannot have direction either if one wants to be able to add these
  energies.

  <p>Mathematically, it is easier to work with scalars than vectors.
  Therefore, energies are easier to work with than forces.  Many
  questions in mechanics can be answered by considering the energies
  involved, and this is often easier than considering the forces.

  <p><b>Exercise 6</b>.  Use energy considerations to calculate the
  speed of the shotput from Example 2 when the shotput is 1 m above
  the ground.  (See Example 4.)  If you like, try to get the same
  answer by using forces.
