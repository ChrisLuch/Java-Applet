      The applet allows controlling the motion of a particle by
      controlling the net force acting on the particle.  The work done
      by the net force on the particle in finite time intervals and
      the particle's kinetic energy at the beginning and end of each
      time interval are simulated.

      This page is designed to get you started using the applet.
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on
      this page are to be done in the applet. You may need to
      toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if your
      screen space is limited.

    </p>
    <p>
      Display the net force by selecting the Force button <img
      src="Force.gif" alt="Force Button" align="top">.  No force
      vector is shown at this point because the net force is zero
      at the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click somewhere in the Force dial, keep the mouse button
      depressed and drag the tip of the force vector inside the dial.
      This force vector is the net force acting on the particle, and
      you are controlling the particle's motion by controlling the net
      force acting on the particle.
    </p>
	 </p>
      During the resulting motion of the particle, the net force
      acting on the particle is represented by a black vector with its
      tail end at the particle.  This vector is identical with the
      force vector in the Force dial.  The particle's velocity is
      represented by a magenta vector.  See Figure 1 below.

      Stop the motion by releasing the mouse button.  You can resume
      the motion by clicking in the Force dial once more.  As long as
      the mouse button is depressed, the particle continues moving
      subject to the net force controlled by you in the Force dial.
    </p>
	 <p>
      After releasing the mouse button and stopping the motion, select
      the Trace <img src="Trace.gif" alt="Trace" align="top"> button
      to display the particle's path in cyan.

      Set the time step to 2.0 s by means of the Time Step slider, and
      STEP FORWARD through the previous motion.  Figure 2 below shows
      what you might see after several steps.  Of course, your motion
      may have taken a very different path.

      The pale ball represents the particle at the beginning of the
      time step and the regularly painted ball the particle at the end
      of the time step.  The displacement of the particle taken during
      the time step is represented by a cyan arrow, and the net force
      acting on the particle at the beginning of the time step is
      represented by a grey arrow.  The net force at the end of the
      time step is not shown.
	 </p>  
    <p>
      REWIND the applet, and STEP FORWARD through the motion once
      more.  Observe that the net force in the Force dial is identical
      with the net force acting on the particle at the beginning of
      each time step.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Click on the magenta dot in
      the center of the particle, and drag it with the mouse to create
      an initial velocity vector that is not zero.  Set an initial
      velocity that is upward and to the right, approximately at a
      30<sup>o</sup> angle with respect to the horizontal as in Figure
      3 below.  Also drag the particle to the left to give it a new
      initial position.

    <p>
      Select the Force <img src="Force.gif" alt="Force button"
      align="top"> button.  A black dot is placed at the center of the
      particle indicating that there is a zero net force acting on the
      particle.  Click in the Force dial directly below the center
      point of the dial to create a downward pointing net force, and
      then immediately release the mouse button to stop the motion.
      Figure 3 illustrates what you can see: the downward net force
      (in black) acting on the particle, and the magenta velocity
      vector of the particle.

      large as possible.  Drag the particle to the left and downward
      to make room for the subsequent motion, which is up and to the
      right, as illustrated in Figure 7 below.

      Note the red kinetic energy bar on the left.  To obtain a bar

      move the KE-Scale slider tab all the way to the left.  This is what
      is done in the situation shown in Figure 7.

      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  With the KE-Scale slider tab all the way to

      Display the data box as you step through the motion, and observe
      the kinetic energy values at the beginning and at the end of
      each step, <i>KE<sub>old</sub></i> and <i>KE<sub>new</sub></i>,
      respectively.  Both increase as you step forward and

      One can generate the same motion by using the applet's 2D mode.
      However, if one is interested in studying motion in one
      dimension only, the 1D mode makes it easier to generate a net
      force along the direction of motion of the particle and thus
      keep the particle moving in a straight line.
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. REWIND the applet. STEP FORWARD and BACK
      through the motion, and carry out observations similar to those
      performed earlier in the 2D mode.
