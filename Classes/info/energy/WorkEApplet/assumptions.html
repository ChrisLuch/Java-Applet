      The applet allows controlling the motion of a particle by
      controlling the net force acting on the particle.  The work done
      by the net force on the particle in finite time intervals and
      the particle's kinetic energy at the beginning and end of each
      time interval are simulated.

	 <p>
      The applet simulates the motion of a particle subject to a given
      net force.  No assumptions are needed other than that the motion
      is governed by Newton's second law of motion.
