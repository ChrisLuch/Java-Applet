      The applet shows two skaters pushing off from each other or,
      alternatively, two blocks that are being forced apart. The
      applet demonstrates the resulting momenta, speeds, and
      kinetic energies of the two skaters or blocks.

      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This page is designed to get you started using the applet.
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on
      this page are to be done in the applet. You may need to
      toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if your
      screen space is limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be familiar with the operation of the applet as
      described in Help.

      Set the masses of both skaters to 60 kg. Play <img src=
      "Play.gif" alt="Play" align="top"> the motion and pause it
      <img src="Pause.gif" alt="Pause" align="top">. You should get
      a display similar to that shown in Figure 1 below.

    <p>
      Notice that the center of mass (CM) of the two-skater system
      is at <i>x<sub>CM</sub></i> = 0. The <i>x</i>-axis is not
      shown in this display, but see Figure 2 below.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the CM at <i>x</i> = 0 and the masses of the two skaters
      equal, the positions of the two skaters should equally far
      from 0. Indeed, they are indicated in the Data boxes as
      <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> = -1.10 m and <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> =
      1.10 m, respectively. All other quantities, speed, magnitude
      of momentum, and kinetic energy, are shown to have equal
      values for the two skaters.

      Without changing any of the settings, click the Show Blocks
      radio button <img src="ShowSkaters.gif" alt="Radio Buttons"

    </p>
    <p>
      The skaters are replaced by blocks, which is the way a
      physicist would tend to look at the system. In this mode, the
      applet also shows an <i>x</i>-axis and the CM of the
      two-block system. See Figure 2 below. Note that none of the
      data in the two Data boxes change when the display is
      switched from Skaters to Blocks or vice versa. The two kinds
      of systems are treated as equivalent.

      Click Replay <img src="Rewind.gif" alt="Rewind" align="top">.
      Make sure the two masses are still set at 60 kg and that the
      two blocks are shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CM will be at 0 and the positions of the two blocks at
      <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> = -0.25 m and <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> =
      0.25 m, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag the <i>x</i>-axis to the left until the CM is at 1.00 m.
      The two blocks will be at <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> = 0.75 m and
      <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> = 1.25 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play the motion, and pause it somewhere. Compare the data
      displayed in the two Data boxes with those shown in Figure 2
      above. The applet should show the same values as those in
      Figure 2, except for the values of the <i>x</i>-coordinates
      of the two blocks.

      Click Replay and drag the <i>x</i>-axis to the right until
      the CM is at 0 again. The block's masses should still be 60
      kg each.
    </p>
    <p>
      Increase the mass of block 1 to 120 kg. The position of the
      CM should move left to -0.08 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play the motion, and pause it somewhere, with the velocity
      and momentum vectors displayed. The magnitude of the velocity
      of the 60-kg block is twice that of the 120-kg block, but the
      momenta of the two blocks have the same magnitude. The
      kinetic energy of the smaller block is <b>twice</b> that of
      the larger block.
