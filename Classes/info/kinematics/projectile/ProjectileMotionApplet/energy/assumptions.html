<div class="sectionheading">
      The applet shows a ball performing projectile motion without air
      resistance and shows the ball's kinetic and potential energies
      during the motion
</div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p>The simulation assumes that the ball's motion is subject only to
the force of gravity and that this force is uniform throughout the
range of the motion.

<p>The coordinate system used consists of a horizontal <i>x</i>-axis
pointing to the right and a vertical <i>y</i>-axis pointing upward.

<p>The gravitational potential energy <i>PE</i> of the ball-earth
system (briefly: the ball's potential energy) is defined so that
<i>PE</i> = 0 when the ball's elevation <i>y</i> is equal to zero.
