      Setting the Ball's Initial Position and Velocity
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1 (Initial Position)</b>. RESET <img src=
      "Reset.gif" alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Press the Data toggle button <img src="Data.gif" alt="Data"
      align="top"> to display the Data box. It displays the ball's
      <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> position coordinates. They are updated
      when you drag the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click on the ball, and drag it to the initial position
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (20.0, 10.0) m, as shown in Figure 1
      below. You may find this easier to do if you display the grid
      by pressing the Grid toggle button <img src="Grid.gif"
         alt="Grid" align="top">. (The grid is not shown in Figure
         1.)
    </p>
    <p>
      It also helps to adjust one coordinate at a time. Drag the
      ball to <i>x</i> = 20.0 m without worrying about the
      <i>y</i>-coordinate. Then, hold down the Shift key while
      dragging the ball. Now the ball will move only vertically,
      and it will be much easier to adjust its initial
      <i>y</i>-coordinate to 10.0 m. The <i>x</i>-coordinate will
      remain unchanged while the Shift key is held down.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2 (Initial Velocity)</b>. The magenta arrow
      represents the ball's velocity. Adjust the initial velocity
      so that its magnitude is 20 m/s and its direction forms an
      angle <font face="symbol">q</font> with the positive
      <i>x</i>-axis equal to 60<sup>o</sup>. Do this by typing
      these values in the third and fourth velocity data fields,
      shown at the bottom of Figure 1, and then press the ENTER key
      on the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how the display of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
      components of the ball's velocity is automatically adjusted
      to <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = 10.0 m/s and <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> =
      17.3 m/s. You can enter values in any of the four velocity
      data fields. When you press ENTER, the values in the other
      fields are adjusted automatically so that they are
      consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can adjust the initial velocity also by dragging the tip
      of the velocity vector. The four velocity data fields will be
      adjusted accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that there is usually some round-off involved when the
      applet calculates <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> and
      <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> to one decimal from <i>v</i> and
      <font face="symbol">q</font>, and vice versa. The rounded
      values are displayed in the velocity data fields. However,
      the exact values corresponding to the values entered by the
      user are used by the applet in calculations.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. REWIND the applet, display the Data box,
      and make sure that the ball's initial position and velocity
      are as in the previous section. These values are listed
      below. Otherwise, RESET the applet and then adjust the applet
      to these values.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>x</i>(0) = 20.0 m
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>y</i>(0) = 10.0 m
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>v</i>(0) = 20.0 m/s
      </li>
      <li>
        <font face="symbol">q</font>(0) = 60<sup>o</sup>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion. Display the ball's path by pressing the
      Trace toggle button <img src="Trace.gif" alt="Trace"
         align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ball has disappeared from the applet window, REWIND
      <img src="Rewind.gif" alt="Rewind" align="top"> the applet.
      Set the Energy Bar Scale slider to 10. PLAY the motion once
      more, and this time observe the changes in the energy column.
      As the ball is rising, the blue potential energy portion is
      increasing in height while the red kinetic energy portion is
      decreasing so that the total height of the column,
      representing the total energy, remains constant. When the
      ball is coming back down, the potential energy is decreasing
      and the kinetic energy is increasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. REWIND the applet. This time, STEP
      <img src="Step.gif" alt="Step" align="top"> through the
      motion by clicking the Step button repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that the horizontal component of the velocity vector,
      i.e., the value of <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> in the data panel
      stays constant at 10.0 m/s. The vertical component
      <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> of the velocity is continually
      decreasing on the way up, becomes zero at the top, and
      continues to decrease on the way down. (<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>
      is negative on the way down. Therefore, although the absolute
      value |<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>| increases, <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>
      itself decreases. E.g., -10 is <b>less</b> than -5.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. As another element of the motion, observe
      the ball's acceleration. Do so by selecting the Vectors
      toggle button <img src="Vectors.gif" alt="Vectors" align=
      "top"> and checking Acceleration in the panel that opens up.
      The acceleration vector is shown as an orange arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion for different initial velocities, and observe
      the acceleration vector each time. To do so, REWIND the
      applet and set the initial velocity component differently
      than before. Then PLAY the motion. Observe that the
      acceleration vector is constant throughout each motion and is
      the same for all motions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ball's acceleration is equal to the acceleration due to
      gravity. You can vary the magnitude <i>g</i> of the
      acceleration due to gravity, and therefore the magnitude of
      the ball's acceleration, between 0 and 20 m/s<sup>2</sup> by
      means of the g-slider. Replay the previous motions for
      another value of <i>g</i>, and again observe the
      acceleration. It should still be constant, but different from
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also observe that a smaller value of <i>g</i> results in a
      higher trajectory.

      first, say, 0.20 s, and then to 0.01-s time steps as you
      approach <i>t</i> = 0.87 s.

      Compare the position and displacement values displayed by
      your applet to those shown in Figure 2 above. The
      displacement vector taken from the beginning of the motion is
      shown in cyan in Figure 2. Display this vector by selecting
      "Displacement" in the vector panel. The components
      <i>d<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>d<sub>y</sub></i> of the
      displacement vector are shown in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fine-tuned stepping through a motion is useful in determining
      the time required for the ball to reach a certain position,
      e.g., its maximum height or the time required to drop back
      down to the <i>x</i>-axis.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>x</i> = 20.0 m,

    <p>
      Keep the ball's mass and the magnitude of the acceleration
      due to gravity equal to <i>m</i> = 0.4 kg and <i>g</i> = 9.8
      m/s<sup>2</sup>, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Data box, and PLAY and STEP the ball's motion to
      time <i>t</i> = 0.87 s, the instant illustrated in Figure 2
      above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculate the work <i>W</i> done on the ball by the
      gravitational force from the equation

    <p align="center">
      <i>W</i> = -<i>mgd<sub>y</sub></i>
    </p>
    <p>
      using the value for the vertical component
      <i>d<sub>y</sub></i> of the ball's displacement given in the
      Data box. Compare your result for W with that displayed in
      the Data box. Your answer should be <i>W</i> = 44.53 J. Note
      that this value differs from the 44.51 J displayed in the
      Data box. The discrepancy is due to round-off in the value of
      <i>d<sub>y</sub></i>. A displacement <i>d<sub>y</sub></i> =
      11.355 m is consistent with the value 11.36 m displayed in
      the Data box and would give <i>W</i> = 44.51 J.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also measure the value of <i>d<sub>y</sub></i> approximately
      by placing a point marker at the ball's position. (See the
      preceding section "Measuring Point Coordinates".) After
      dragging the marker to the center of the ball's, you will
      have to PLAY the motion to move the ball out of the way.
      Compare your measured value of <i>d<sub>y</sub></i> to that
      in the Data box in Figure 2 and in your applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. REWIND the applet. Record the value of the
      potential energy <i>PE</i> from the Data box. It should be
      <i>PE</i> = 39.20 J.

    <p>
      Again PLAY/STEP the motion to <i>t</i> = 0.87 s. Record the
      new value of the potential energy at <i>t</i> = 0.87 s. It
      should be <i>PE</i> = 83.71 J. Work out the change in the
      potential energy, <font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> =

      Note that in this case <font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i>
      &gt; 0 and that -<i>W</i> &gt; 0 as well, since <i>W</i> &lt;
