<div class="title">Help - Projectile Motion: Two Balls</div>

<p><div class="sectionheading">The applet shows simultaneous
projectile motions of two balls with or without air resistance</div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p>The red ball will always move without air resistance, and will be
subject to the force of gravity only.  The yellow ball will be subject
to both the force of gravity and the force of air resistance.  The
magnitude of the latter will depend on the value of the drag
coefficient <i>C</i> set by the user.  If <i>C</i> = 0, the yellow
ball too will move without air resistance.

<p>The simulation assumes that the acceleration of the yellow ball
consists of two parts: one due to gravity and one due to air
resistance.  The former is constant, the latter has magnitude
proportional to the square of the ball's speed and direction opposite
to the ball's velocity.

<p>Expressed in symbols, the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components of the
ball's acceleration, <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>a<sub>y</sub></i>,
are equal to:

<p><div align="center"><i>a<sub>x</sub></i> =
-(<i>C</i>/<i>m</i>)<i>v</i><i>v<sub>x</sub></i>

<img src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> and <img src="small.gif"
height="1" width="20">

<i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = -<i>g</i> -
(<i>C</i>/<i>m</i>)<i>v</i><i>v<sub>y</sub></i>,
</div>

<p>where <i>C</i> is the drag coefficient, <i>m</i> the ball's mass,
<i>v</i> the ball's speed, <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> and
<i>v<sub>y</sub></i> the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>-components of the
ball's velocity, and <i>g</i> the magnitude of the acceleration due to
gravity.

<p>The <i>x</i>-axis is horizontal and points to the right, and the
<i>y</i>-axis is vertical and points upward.

<p>These two equations can be expressed by the one vector equation

<p align="center"><img src="a.gif" align="bottom"> = <img src="g.gif"
align="absbottom"> - (<i>C</i>/<i>m</i>) <i>v</i> <img src="v.gif"
align="bottom"> .</p>

<p>The drag coefficient <i>C</i> determines the magnitude of the force
of air resistance on the object,

<p align="center"><img src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>res</sub> = -
<i>C</i> <i>v</i> <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> .</p>

<p><i>C</i> depends on the shape and size of the object, not directly
on the mass of the object.  

<p>Often, a change in an object's mass will be accompanied by a change
in the object's size and therefore the value of <i>C</i>. In the
applet, however, changing the mass has no effect on <i>C</i>.  You may
imagine that the object is hollow and that increasing its mass is
accomplished by filling some of the interior of the object.
