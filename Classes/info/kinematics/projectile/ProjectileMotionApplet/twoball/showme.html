      to make these settings are given below Figure 1.

    <p>
      <u>Instructions on setting the initial positions and
      velocities</u>. Display the Data box. Click on the red ball
      (Ball 1) and, while holding the Shift key down, drag it up
      the <i>y</i>-axis to (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 40.0) m. The
      exact coordinates of the balls are displayed in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the yellow ball (Ball 2) to the same position as Ball 1.
      It is easier to adjust one coordinate at a time. Drag the
      ball to <i>x</i> = 0 without worrying about the
      <i>y</i>-coordinate. Then, while holding down the Shift key,
      drag the ball to <i>y</i> = 40 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set the initial velocities of the two balls by typing the
      values in Eqs. (1b) into the velocity data fields and
      pressing ENTER.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. You can adjust the initial velocity of a
      ball also by dragging the tip of the ball's velocity vector,
      if the vector is displayed. Try it with Ball 2. Observe how
      the velocity components in the velocity data fields for Ball
      2 change as you drag the tip of the velocity vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present situation, both balls are in the same
      location. Make their velocity vectors equal as well by
      setting the velocity components in the velocity data fields
      of both balls equal to (<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,
      <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) = (15.0, 0) m/s. Make sure that both
      balls are still in the same position at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) =
      (0, 40.0) m.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet "focuses" on one ball and its velocity vector. The
      ball that was dragged last is the one that has focus. If you
      drag the common tip of the two velocity vectors, the velocity
      of the ball that has focus will be changed. Similarly,
      clicking at the common location of both balls and dragging
      will cause the ball with focus to be dragged. To switch the
      focus from one ball to the other, double-click anywhere in
      the applet window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try this. Drag the common tip of the velocity vector and
      observe which velocity is affected by looking at the velocity
      data fields. Restore this velocity to its original setting.
      Then double-click somewhere in the applet window, and drag
      the common tip of the velocity vector again. It should be the
      other ball's velocity that gets changed this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try the same with dragging the balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Display a coordinate grid by clicking the
      Grid toggle button <img src="Grid.gif" alt="Grid" align=
      "top">. The Grid can be helpful in setting a ball's position
      or in measuring a ball's trajectory. Hide the Grid by
      deselecting the Grid button by clicking the button again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Display the Data box. Restore the ball's
      initial velocities and positions as in Eqs.(1), and PLAY the
      motion. Display the balls' paths by pressing the Trace toggle
      button. If you PAUSE the motion at or near <i>t</i> = 1.95 s,
      you should be able to see the configurations and trajectories
      shown in Figure 2 below. The red ball's trajectory is
      superimposed on the <i>y</i>-axis.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that the balls' <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> position
      coordinates in the Data box are updated throughout the
      motion, along with the value <i>t</i> of the time elapsed
      from the beginning of the motion and the direction angles
      &theta; of the two balls. These angles
      are measured relative to the positive <i>x</i>-axis and are
      taken positive if the velocity points generally upward and
      negative if it points generally downward. Both angles are
      negative in the present case.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Display the Grid, and estimate the
      positions of the two balls when the motion is paused, as in
      Figure 2. Obtain a more accurate value by selecting the
      Coordinates button and clicking on the center of one of the
      balls. The coordinates of the point clicked will be
      displayed.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Let's start with both balls subject only
      to gravity and no air resistance. This will be the case if
      the drag coefficient <i>C</i> is set to 0 on the Drag Coeff.
      slider.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have not changed the initial setting from that defined
      in Eqs.(1) above, click REWIND <img src="Rewind.gif" alt=
      "Rewind" align="top">. The setting shown in Figure 1 above
      should be restored. Otherwise, RESET the applet and set the
      positions and velocities of the two balls as in Eqs.(1).
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion. Display the balls' paths. They should be as
      in Figure 2 above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. REWIND the applet. This time, STEP through
      the motion by clicking the Step button repeatedly. Set the
      step size to 0.20 s. Stepping makes it easier to compare
      simultaneous data for the two balls. Select the Components
      button to display the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components of the
      velocity vectors of the two balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that the <i>y</i>-components of the velocities of the
      two balls are equal at all times and that the
      <i>x</i>-component of the velocity of Ball 2 remains constant
      at 15 m/s. This can also be seen by watching the velocity
      data fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Determine the time required for the red
      ball to fall down to the <i>x</i>-axis as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      REWIND the applet. Make sure the Time Step slider is adjusted
      to a step size of 0.2 s. Take fourteen steps until you are at
      <i>t</i> = 2.80 s and at <i>y</i> = 1.54 m. Then adjust the
      slider to a step size of 0.01 s, and take five more steps
      until you are at <i>t</i> = 2.85 s and <i>y</i> = 0.16 m.
      Then take one more step until you are at <i>t</i> = 2.86 s
      and <i>y</i> = -0.12 m, below the <i>x</i>-axis. The ball
      therefore reaches the <i>x</i>-axis at approximately <i>t</i>
      = 2.856 s.

      in the applet window. A bull's eye target <img src=
      "OneBalltarget.gif" alt="target image" align="top"> will be
      placed at the point clicked. Drag the target to
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (20, 30) m. The target's coordinates
      will be displayed as long as the mouse button is depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click on the target a second time while the Target button is
      selected. The target will be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the Coordinates button <img src="Coordinates.gif"
         alt="Coordinates" align="top">, and click anywhere in the
         applet window. A "+" marker will be placed at the point
         clicked, and the coordinates of the point will be
         displayed next to the marker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag the point marked by a "+" to the point
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (50, 20) m.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Coordinates button is selected, click on the point
      marked by a "+" a second time, and the point will be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Set a target, and find the initial
      velocity so that Ball 2 (the yellow ball) will hit the target
      when starting from a given position.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make it more challenging, move Ball 1 to a different
      intial position and find an initial velocity for Ball 1 so
      that this ball too will hit the same target.

      Including Air Resistance
    </div>
    <p>
      The applet is designed so that only Ball 2 (yellow) can have
      air resistance and so that only the mass of Ball 2 can be
      varied. Carry out the following exercises to become familiar
      with what can be varied. Display the balls' paths in all
      cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sliders that you will be using to adjust the conditions
      affecting the balls are
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the <i>g</i>-slider, which affects both balls equally,
      </li>
      <li>
        the Drag Coeff. slider, which affects only Ball 2,
      </li>
      <li>
        the Mass slider, which affects only Ball 2.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Move Ball 2 to the
      origin. Ball 1 is already at the origin. Set both balls'
      velocities to

      width= "40">(2)
    </p>
    <p>
      Set the drag coefficient <i>C</i> for Ball 2 equal to 0.002
      kg/m and the mass of Ball 2 to 0.1 kg. Then PLAY the motion.
      You should be able to observe that Ball 2 does not go as high
      and as far as Ball 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. REWIND the applet, and change the mass
      setting of Ball 2 to 0.5 kg. Make no other changes. Then PLAY
      the motion again, and observe that a more masssive ball is
      affected less by air resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. REWIND the applet, change the mass setting
      of Ball 2 to 0.1 kg, and the drag coefficient of Ball 2 to
      0.050 kg/m. Set the magnitude <i>g</i> of the acceleration
      due to gravity equal to 0. The last setting will affect both
      balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion. Both balls should be moving along the same
      straight line, but Ball 2 should be slowing down very
      noticeably.
