<p>The simulation assumes that the only force acting on the ball is
the force of gravity so that the ball's acceleration is equal to the
so-called "acceleration due to gravity".
</p>

<p>Moreover, it is assumed that the range of the ball, both
horizontally and vertically, is small enough so that the force of
gravity acting on the ball and therefore the ball's acceleration are
constant, in magnitude and direction.
</p>

<p>However, the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity can be
adjusted, to simulate conditions present at different elevations from
the earth's surface or on different planets.
