<div class="title">Lesson - Projectile Motion: One Ball No Air</div>

<p><div class="sectionheading">The applet shows a ball performing
projectile motion without air resistance</div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p><b>Prerequisites</b>

<p>Students should be familiar with the concepts of velocity and
acceleration, at the vector level, and have a working knowledge of the
kinematical equations for motion with constant acceleration in
one and two dimensions.

<p><b>Learning Outcomes</b>

<p>Students will learn that projectile motion without air resistance
is a motion with constant acceleration.  They will learn to apply to
projectile motion the kinematical equations of motion with constant
acceleration, in one and two dimensions.  They will deepen their
understanding of acceleration as the time-rate-of-change of velocity
by examining the example of projectile motion.

<p><b>Instructions</b>

<p>Students should know how the applet functions, as described in Help and
ShowMe.

<p>The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in the
following text are to be done in the applet. You may need to toggle
back and forth between instructions and applet if your screen space is
limited.

	 <p>RESET the applet.

	 <p>Set the ball's initial position to (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (20.0,
	 10.0) m and its initial velocity to a magnitude of 20 m/s and to a
	 direction that forms an angle <font face="symbol">q</font> with
	 the positive <i>x</i>-axis equal to 60<sup>o</sup>.  The applet
	 should be configured as shown in Figure 1 below.  

	 <p align="center"><img src="OneBallSimpleInitial.gif"></p>

	 <p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

	 <p><b>Question 1</b>. When you PLAY the motion, the ball will be
	 moving without air resistance.  What will be the ball's
	 acceleration on the way up, right at the top, and on the way down?

	 <p>Make a prediction, then press Play and observe.  Display the
    acceleration (orange) by selecting the Vectors button and checking
    Acceleration in the Vector panel.

	 <p><b>Answer</b>.  You should be able to observe that the
	 acceleration vector remains constant throughout the motion, both
	 in magnitude and direction.  In particular, it is <b>not</b> zero
	 at the peak of the motion.

	 <p><b>Question 2</b>.  REWIND the applet, and change the direction
    of the ball's initial velocity so that it forms an angle <font
    face="symbol">q</font> =  60<sup>o</sup> with the positive
    <i>x</i>-axis.  Does the acceleration vector change as you enter
    this new initial velocity and does it vary during the subsequent
    motion?

	 <p><b>Answer</b>.  You should find that the answer is NO on both
	 counts.

	 <p><b>Question 3</b>.  What happens to the acceleration when you
	 change the launch angle to 90<sup>o</sup>?  This will result in
	 straight up-and-down motion.

	 <p><b>Answer</b>.  You should be able to observe that again there
	 is no change in the acceleration when the new initial velocity is
	 entered and that the acceleration remains constant throughout the
	 motion.  In particular, the acceleration is <b>not</b> zero at the
	 top, even though the velocity <b>is</b> equal to zero momentarily!

	 <p>Acceleration is related to a <b>change</b> in velocity, and the
	 velocity can be changing even at an instant when it is zero!  Have
	 a close look at the following question and its answer to
	 understand this better.

	 <p><b>Question 4</b>.  What is the value of the acceleration in all
	 of these cases?  Obtain an answer by observing the rate at which
	 the velocity changes.  Do this for an initial velocity of
	 magnitude 20 m/s and direction angle of 60<sup>o</sup>.

	 <p><b>Answer</b>.  For a finite time interval of duration <font
	 face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>, the average acceleration during
	 that time interval is defined as the ratio: change in velocity
	 during the time interval divided by the duration of the time
	 interval.  Expressed symbolically,

	 <p align="center"><img src="a.gif" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub> =
    (<font face="symbol">D</font><img src="v.gif"
    align="bottom">)/<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>  <img
    src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (1)</p>
	 
	 <p>or, in terms of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components,

	 <p align="center"><i>a<sub>x,av</sub></i> = (<font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>v<sub>x</sub></i>)/<font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>, <img src="small.gif" height="1"
    width="20"> <i>a<sub>y,av</sub></i> = (<font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>v<sub>y</sub></i>)/<font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> .<img src="small.gif" height="1"
    width="40"> (2)</p>

	 <p>For a review of components, see the section <a
	 href="#Components">Components</a> in the Appendix to this lesson.

    <p>Set the Time Step slider to a time step of 0.5 s, and STEP
    through the motion.

	 <p>You will notice that the horizontal velocity component,
	 <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = 10 m/s, is constant throughout the motion.
	 The shadow ball on the horizontal axis moves with this constant
	 velocity.  Thus, the first one of Eqs.(2) implies that there is no
	 horizontal acceleration, i.e., <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> = 0.

	 <p> However, there is vertical acceleration.  The shadow ball on
	 the vertical axis moves up and then down and does not move with
	 constant velocity.  We need to measure its acceleration.

	 <p>As you STEP through the motion, record the times <i>t</i> elapsed
	 from the start of the motion against the corresponding values of
	 the <i>y</i>-component of the velocity and arrange your results in
	 a table.  You should find the values listed in the first two
	 columns of Table 1 below.  

	 <p>Using Eq.(2) above, obtain values of the <i>y</i>-component of
	 the average acceleration as follows.  Take the differences in the
	 <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>-values (later value minus earlier value) and
	 record them in a third column of your table. The
	 <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>-values are listed in Table 1 in between the
	 individual time instants because they apply to the time intervals
	 between two such times.

	 <p>Finally, divide the (<font
	 face="symbol">D</font><i>v<sub>y</sub></i>)-values by the time
	 elapsed between two successive instants.  This time elapsed is
	 equal to the time step of 0.5 s.  Record the results in a fourth
	 column.  These are the values of the <i>y</i>-component of the
	 average acceleration.  As you can see, the average acceleration in
	 the <i>y</i>-direction is constant and has the value -9.8
	 m/s<sup>2</sup>.  This is the acceleration of the shadow ball on
	 the <i>y</i>-axis.

  <p>You could repeat these measurements for shorter and shorter time
  steps, at least mathematically.  In the laboratory, there will be
  practical limitations to how short one can take the time intervals.
  If you wanted to use the applet for this, you would encounter
  numerical round-off errors when the step size becomes too small
  because the applet is not displaying sufficiently many decimals.
  However, mathematically you could keep on reducing the step size.
  You would find that <i>a<sub>x,av</sub></i> = 0 and
  <i>a<sub>y,av</sub></i> = -9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> at any step size.
  Therefore, the limit of the average acceleration as the step size
  goes to zero is equal to these values also.  The limit is called the
  <i>instantaneous</i> acceleration, or just <i>acceleration</i> for
  short.

  <p><b>Final Result</b>.  The ball's acceleration is 0 in the
  <i>x</i>-direction and -9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> in the
  <i>y</i>-direction.  Formally, using component notation, one writes
  this as follows:

  <p align="center"><i>a<sub>x</sub></i> = 0, <img src="small.gif"
  height="1" width="20"> <i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = -9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>
  <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (3)

  <p>This acceleration is called the <i>acceleration due to
  gravity</i> because it is caused by gravity alone.  This is the
  acceleration close to the surface of the earth.  Higher up, or
  perhaps on a different planet, the acceleration due to gravity has a
  different value. The applet lets you vary the magnitude <i>g</i> of
  the acceleration due to gravity by means of the <i>g</i>- slider.

  <p>Projectile motion can be described in terms of the motions of two
  shadow balls moving on the horizontal and vertical axes.

  <p><blockquote>The projections of projectile motion onto the
  horizontal and vertical axes - imagine them performed by two shadow
  balls - are motions with constant velocity and constant
  acceleration, respectively.  The acceleration of the shadow ball
  moving on the vertical axis is downward and, near the surface of the
  earth, has magnitude <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</blockquote>

  <p><u>Note</u>. The term "projectile motion" applies to the motion
  of an object in a uniform gravitational field.  Such a field exists
  to a very good approximation within a region of space extending a
  few kilometers horizontally and vertically from a given point on the
  earth's surface.  Motions extending over a larger range, in which
  the earth's curvature and the decrease of the value of <i>g</i> with
  elevation become significant, are called "ballistic motions".

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>. Set <i>g</i> to a different value, measure the
  ball's acceleration as above, and compare what you find with the
  value of <i>g</i> set by the slider.

 <p><b>Question 5</b>.  When a ball is thrown straight up, what is the
  ball's acceleration at the peak of the ball's trajectory where the
  ball's velocity is momentarily equal to zero?.

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  The acceleration has the same value at the top as
  on the way up or on the way down, namely, <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> = 0
  and <i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = - 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.  The acceleration
  is <b>not</b> zero.

  <p>Reason: Even though <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> = 0 at this moment, <font
  face="symbol">D</font><i>v<sub>y</sub></i> taken over a short time
  interval containing this instant is <b>not</b> zero and when divided
  by the time duration <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> of this
  interval can give a finite result that has a non-zero limit as <font
  face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> approaches 0.  Note that the ratio
  (<font face="symbol">D</font><i>v<sub>y</sub></i>)/<font
  face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> does not change (and does <b>not</b>
  go to 0!) when both the numerator and denominator are made smaller
  by the same factor.

  Ball's Motion</a>

    <p><b>Question 1</b>.  Given the same initial conditions as above,

	 <p align="center">(<i>x</i>(0), <i>y</i>(0)) = (20, 10) m, <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> (<i>v</i>(0), <font
  face="symbol">q</font>(0)) = (20 m/s, 60<sup>o</sup>), <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> (4)

    <p>where will the ball be at <i>t</i> = 2.50 s, and what will be
    its velocity at that time?

	 <p><b>Answer</b>.  You can determine the answers "experimentally"
	 by setting the applet to the given initial conditions and then
	 stepping the motion forward to time <i>t</i> = 2.50 s.  You should
	 see what is shown in Figure 2 below.

	 <p align="center"><img src="OneBallSimple2_5sec.gif"></p>

	 <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

	 <p>To calculate the position and velocity is straightforward if
	 you have the kinematical equations for motion with constant
	 acceleration.  They are listed in Table 2 in the Appendix <a
	 href="#ConstantAcceleration">"Equations For Motion With Constant
	 Acceleration"</a>.  The equations are used in Eqs.(7), (8), (10),
	 and (12) below.

	 <p>The equations are in terms of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components.
	 The initial position is already in this form, but the initial
	 velocity is in polar form and needs to be converted to component
	 form.  The necessary transformation equations are described in the
	 section <a href="#Components">Components</a> of the Appendix to
	 this lesson.

	 <p>Here are the calculations.

	 <p align="center"><i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0) = <i>v</i>(0) cos <font
  face="symbol">q</font>(0) = 20 cos 60<sup>o</sup> = 10.0 m/s <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> (5)

    <p align="center"><i>v<sub>y</sub></i>(0) = <i>v</i>(0) sin <font
  face="symbol">q</font>(0) = 20 sin 60<sup>o</sup> = 17.3 m/s <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> (6)

	 <p>Substituting these values and values (3) of the acceleration
	 components into the equations for the velocity and position
	 components and then setting <i>t</i> = 2.50 s, gives for the
	 velocity

    <p align="center"><i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(t) = v<sub>x</sub></i>(0) +
    a<sub>x</sub></i><i>t</i> = 10 + 0 = 10 m/s <img src="small.gif"
    height="1" width="20"> (7)

    <p align="center"><i>v<sub>y</sub></i>(t) = v<sub>y</sub></i>(0) +
    <i>a<sub>y</sub>t</i> = 17.3 - 9.8<i>t</i><img src="small.gif"
    height="1" width="20"> (8)</p>

	 <p>whence

	 <p align="center"><i>v<sub>y</sub></i>(2.5 s) = 17.3 - 9.8x2.5 =
    -7.2 m/s .  <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> (9)</p>

	 <p>and for the position

    <p align="center"><i>x</i>(t) =
      <i>x</i>(0) + v<sub>x</sub></i>(0)<i>t</i> +
      (<i>a<sub>x</sub></i>/2)<i>t</i><sup>2</sup> = 20 + 10<i>t</i> +
      0<img src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> (10)

	 <p>whence
	
	 <p align="center"><i>x</i>(2.5 s) = 20 + 10x2.5 = 45.0 m <img
	 src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> (11)

	 <p>and

    <p align="center"><i>y</i>(t) =
      <i>x</i>(0) + v<sub>y</sub></i>(0)<i>t</i> +
      (<i>a<sub>y</sub></i>/2)<i>t</i><sup>2</sup> = 10 + 17.3<i>t</i> -
      (9.8/2)<i>t</i><sup>2</sup> <img src="small.gif" height="1"
      width="20"> (12)

    <p>whence

    <p align="center"><i>y</i>(2.5 s) = 10 + 17.3x2.5 -
      (9.8/2)x2.5<sup>2</sup> = 22.6 m<img src="small.gif" height="1"
      width="20"> (13)

    <p>The velocity and position values (7), (9), (11), and (13) agree
    with the values displayed in Figure 2 within round-off error.

	 <p><b>Exercise 1</b>. REWIND the applet, and change the
	 <i>x</i>-component of the initial velocity from 10.0 m/s to 20.0
	 m/s, without changing the <i>y</i>-component of the initial
	 velocity.  Use the applet to again determine the position and
	 velocity at <i>t</i> = 2.50 s.

	 <p>You should be able to observe that the <i>y</i>-components of
	 the position and velocity at 2.50 s are unchanged.  Thus, changes
	 in the motion in the <i>x</i>-direction do not affect the motion
	 in the <i>y</i>-direction.  The two shadow balls move
	 independently of each other.  You may want to test this further by
	 changing the initial <i>y</i>-component of the velocity and not
	 the <i>x</i>-component.  The motion in the <i>x</i>-direction will
	 remain unchanged.

	 <p>The independence of the horizontal and vertical components of
	 projectile motion without air resistance is apparent also from the
	 structure of the equations in Table 2.  The equations for the
	 <i>x</i>-componnets do not contain any <i>y</i>-components, and
	 vice versa.  This simplifies the mathematical aspects of
	 projectile motion a great deal. Instead of a complicated
	 two-dimensional problem, one is dealing with two separate
	 one-dimensional problems.

	 <p><b>Exercise 2</b>.  REWIND the applet.  Then set the ball to
	 the position values (11) and (13), which is the position occupied
	 in the motion in Question 1 at <i>t</i> = 2.50 s.  Then set the
	 velocity values to the negative of the values it had in that
	 motion at <i>t</i> = 2.5 s, i.e., to the negative of values (7)
	 and (9), i.e., to <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = -10.0 m/s and
	 <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> = 7.2 m/s.  Then run the simulation while
	 keeping the trace displayed.

	 <p>You should find that the ball retraces its earlier path
	 exactly.  This is called <i>motion reversibility</i> or also
	 <i>time reversibility</i>, although it is not the time that is
	 reversed here.

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 3</b></p>

  <p><u>Axes and Components</u>.  In the following equations for the
  motion of a particle with constant acceleration it is assumed that
  an <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> coordinate system has been chosen and that the
  particle has the same acceleration everywhere, with constant
  <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> and
  <i>a<sub>y</sub></i>.

  <p><u>Sign Changes</u>. In the diagram in Figure 3 above, the
  direction of the acceleration vector is such that both the <i>x</i>
  and <i>y</i> components of the vector are positive.  In another
  situation, the direction of the vector may be different, so that one
  or both of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components may be negative.
  (Or the direction of the vector may be as shown, but the directions
  of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes may have been chosen differently,
  again causing one or both components of the vector to be negative.)
  The equations below apply to all such situations.  No signs in these
  equations need to be changed.</p>

 <p><u>2D vs. 1D</u>.  The following equations are formulated for the
 2D case, motion in two dimensions.  However, they also apply to 1D
 motion, motion along a straight line.  In this case, it will often be
 convenient to choose either the <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> axis to be along
 the line of motion.  Assuming the motion is along the <i>x</i> axis,
 you will need only the equations for the <i>x</i> components.  All
 <i>y</i> components in any of the equations will be zero.  Similarly,
 if the motion is restricted to the <i>y</i>-axis, just use the
 <i>y</i> equations and ignore the <i>x</i> equations.</p>

<p>Vectors can be described in terms of their scalar components,
<i>components</i> for short.  A vector in two dimensions has two
scalar components, one along the <i>x</i>-axis and one along the
<i>y</i>-axis.  For a vector <img src="a.gif" align="bottom">, these
components are denoted <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>a<sub>y</sub></i>,
respectively.  Figure 4 below illustrates the components for a vector
<img src="a.gif" align="bottom"> that is in the first quadrant.

<p align="center"><img src="ScalarComponents.jpg"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 4</b></p>

<p>The <i>scalar components</i> of a vector are the vector's
projections onto the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes.  In Figure 4, they
are shown in green and yellow, respectively.  They are called <b>scalar</b>
components because they are numbers.  The scalar components are equal
to the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of the tip of the vector if
the tail end of the vector is at the origin of the coordinate system,
as it is here.

<p>The vector in Figure 4 has a magnitude of 8 and an angle <font
face="symbol">q</font> with the positive <i>x</i>-axis equal to
30<sup>o</sup>.  Its scalar components have the values

<p align="center"><i>a<sub>x</sub></i> = 6.93, <img
   src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> <i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = 4.00 <img
   src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (17)

<p>For vectors in the first quadrant, both components are positive,
but for vectors in one of the other three quadrants one or both
components are negative. E.g., for a vector in the second quadrant,
the <i>x</i>-component is negative while the <i>y</i>-component is
still positive.

<p>The definition of the sine and cosine imply that

<p align="center"><i>a<sub>x</sub></i> = <i>a</i> cos <font
face="symbol">q</font>, <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="40">
<i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = <i>a</i> sin <font face="symbol">q</font>.<img
src="small.gif" height="1" width="20">(18)

<p>Substituting <i>a</i> = 8.00 and <font face="symbol">q</font> =
30.0<sup>o</sup> into these equations, gives the values listed in
Equations (17) and illustrated in Figure 4.

<p>Note that Equations (18) are correct even if the vector <img
src="a.gif" align="bottom"> is in the second, third or fourth
quadrant.  No signs need to be changed.  Any sign changes are
automatically taken care of by the signs of the cosine and sine
functions for values of <font face="symbol">q</font> in any of these
other quadrants.
