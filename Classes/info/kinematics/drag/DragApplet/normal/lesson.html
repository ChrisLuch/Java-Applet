  <div class="sectionheading">
    The applet determines the average velocity and average speed for a ball as
    the ball is moved from one point to another.
  </div>
  <hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

  <p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>

  <p>Students should understand the concepts of displacement and distance
  traveled and should have a working knowledge of vectors.</p>

  <p><b>Learning Outcomes</b></p>

  <p>Students will develop an understanding of the physics concepts of average
  velocity and average speed, will get more experience in working with vector
  and scalar quantities, and will learn about averages over time.</p>

  <p><b>Instructions</b></p>

  <p>The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in this lesson
  are to be carried out in the applet. You may need to toggle back and forth
  between instructions and applet if your screen space is limited. You should
  be prepared to do calculations to verify the numbers that are generated by
  the applet.</p>

      <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub>,
      <i>v<sub>av</sub></i>, and |<img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
      align="bottom"><sub>av</sub>|.

      <p>Average velocity is a vector and therefore denoted <img
      src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub> in
      boldface with an arrow on top. Average speed is a scalar and
      therefore denoted <i>v<sub>av</sub></i> in plainface without an
      arrow. When writing these symbols by hand, the only distinction
      between them is the arrow. Make sure you use it when you mean
      velocity.</p>

      <p>We will see below that the magnitude of the average velocity
      is in general <b>not</b> equal to the average speed. Therefore,
      one must use a different notation to distinguish between the
      two. The symbol |<img src= "v.gif" alt="vector v"
      align="bottom"><sub>av</sub>| will be used to denote the
      magnitude (absolute value) of the average velocity while
      <i>v<sub>av</sub></i> denotes average speed. This is an example
      where the magnitude of a vector cannot be denoted by the same
      symbol as the vector but without arrow.</p> </li>

    <li>

      <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align="bottom">, &#916;<img
      src="r.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom">, |<img src="d.gif"
      alt="vector d" align="bottom">|, <i>d</i>, and <i>s</i>.

      <p>Displacement is a vector quantity denoted <img src="d.gif"
      alt="vector d" align= "bottom"> in boldface with an arrow on
      top. In this case, no confusion is possible if the magnitude of
      the displacement is denoted <i>d</i>.  However, it could also be
      denoted |<img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align="bottom">|.
      Another notation for displacement is &#916;<img src="r.gif"
      alt="vector r" align= "bottom">. It reflects the fact that
      displacement is the difference between (change in) two
      positions. Note that the magnitude <i>d</i> of a displacement is
      in general different from the distance <i>s</i> traveled.  This
      is the reason why the letter <i>d</i> is not used in MAP to
      denote distance traveled.</p> </li>

    <li>&#916;<i>t</i> and <i>t</i>.

      <p>Time elapsed measures an <b>interval</b> of time and is therefore
      properly denoted &#916;<i>t</i>, where the Delta symbol indicates a
      difference: &#916;<i>t</i> = <i>t<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>t<sub>1</sub></i>,
      the differene between a later instant of time <i>t<sub>2</sub></i> and an
      earlier instant of time <i>t<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

      <p>E.g., the time elapsed between the two instants <i>t<sub>1</sub></i> =
      10 s and <i>t<sub>2</sub></i> = 17 s is &#916;<i>t</i> =
      <i>t<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>t<sub>1</sub></i> = 17 - 10 = 7 s.</p>

      <p>The symbol <i>t</i> is used to denote an <b>instant</b> of time.</p>

      <p>If one considers a time interval extending from <i>t</i> = 0 to some
      later instant <i>t</i> of time, the time elapsed is &#916;<i>t</i> =
      <i>t</i> - 0 = <i>t</i>. In such a case, <i>t</i> can therefore be used
      to denote time elapsed. This is what is done in the applet.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Definition of <b>average velocity</b> and <b>average speed</b>.

      <p><i>Average velocity</i> is defined as the ratio: displacement divided
      by time elapsed. In symbols:</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="v.gif" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub> =
      <img src="d.gif" align="bottom">/&#916;<i>t</i> = &#916;<img src="r.gif"
      align="bottom">/&#916;<i>t</i>. <img src="small.gif" height="1" width=
      "40"> (1)</p>
    </li>

    <li style="list-style: none">
      <p>Note that here we are dividing a displacement, not a "change" in a
      displacement, by the corresponding time elapsed. A displacement is a
      change in position, but a "change in displacement" does not make any
      sense here.</p>

      <p><i>Average speed</i> is defined as the ratio: distance traveled
      divided by time elapsed. In symbols:</p>

      <p align="center"><i>v<sub>av</sub></i> = <i>s</i>/&#916;<i>t</i>.
      <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="80"> (2)</p>

      <p>Again, you will find that in the applet &#916;<i>t</i> is replaced by
      <i>t</i> in these definitions, for the reason mentioned above.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Polar</b> vs. <b>Cartesian</b>

      <p>The applet gives values for vector quantities in two forms that will
      be referred to as <i>polar</i> and <i>Cartesian</i> in the following.</p>

      <p>In the polar form, a vector is specified in terms of its
      magnitude and direction, the latter specified by an angle
      relative to the positive <i>x</i>-axis in the positive
      (counter-clockwise) sense.</p>

      <p>In the Cartesian form, a vector is specified in terms of its <i>x</i>
      and <i>y</i> components.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <div class="sectionheading">
    <a name="AvVelocity" id="AvVelocity">Average Velocity vs. Average Speed</a>
  </div>

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>.  With the initial position of the ball set at
  (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>i</sub> = (10.0,-15.0) m, drag the ball to near
  (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>f</sub> = (-20.0,-10.0) m along a curved path, as in
  the snapshot in Figure 1 below. You may find it helpful to display the grid
  while setting the initial position and moving the ball.

  <p>Display the initial and final position vectors, <img src="r.gif"
  align= "bottom"><sub>i</sub> and <img src="r.gif"
  align="bottom"><sub>f</sub>, respectively, and the data.  Figure 1
  below is an illustration of the kind of thing you should see.  The
  frames around the data are omitted in Figure 1.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="AvVelocitycurved.jpg" alt="Displacement
  along curved path"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

  <p>The following data are included among those in shown in Figure 1:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>distance traveled: <i>s</i> = 36.5 m</li>

    <li>displacement (polar form): <img src="d.gif" align="bottom"> =
    (<i>d</i>, &theta;) = (30.4 m, 170.5<sup>o</sup>)</li>

    <li>displacement (Cartesian form): <img src="d.gif" align="bottom"> =
    (&#916;<i>x</i>, &#916;<i>y</i>) = (-30.0, 5.0) m</li>

    <li>time elapsed: <i>t</i> = 4.7 s</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Question 1</b>. Given these data, what is the average speed?</p>

  <p><b>Answer</b>. Using Definition (2) above gives</p>

  <p align="center"><i>v<sub>av</sub></i> = <i>s</i>/<i>t</i> = 36.5/4.7 = 7.8
  m/s. <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="20"> (3)</p>

  <p>This agrees, within round-off error, with the applet value displayed in
  Figure 1.</p>

  <p><b>Question 2</b>. Given these data, what is the average velocity? Give the
  answer in both the polar and Cartesian forms.</p>

  <p><b>Answer (in polar form)</b>. Using Definition (1) above
  gives</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="v.gif" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub> =
  <img src= "d.gif" align="bottom">/<i>t</i> = (<i>d</i>/<i>t</i>,
  &theta;) = (30.4/4.7, 170.5<sup>o</sup>) = (6.5 m/s,
  170.5<sup>o</sup>). <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="20">
  (4)</p>

  <p>This agrees, within round-off error, with the applet value displayed in
  Figure 1.</p>

  <p>Note that to divide a vector by a scalar, one divides its magnitude by the
  scalar, but does not change the angle.</p>

  <p><b>Observation</b>.  The magnitude of the average velocity has
  the value |<img src="v.gif" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub>| = 6.5 m/s,
  and the average speed has the value <i>v<sub>av</sub></i> = 7.8
  m/s. The two values are <b>not equal</b>! This is the reason,
  pointed out at the beginning of the lesson, why the magnitude of the
  average velocity cannot be denoted by the symbol
  <i>v<sub>av</sub></i>. Why is the average speed greater than the
  magnitude of the average velocity? Could there ever be a situation
  in which it is the other way around?</p>

  <p><b>Answer (in Cartesian form)</b>.   Again, using Definition
  (1) gives</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="v.gif" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub> = <img src=
  "d.gif" align="bottom">/<i>t</i> = (&#916;<i>x</i>/<i>t</i>,
  &#916;<i>y</i>/<i>t</i>) = (-30.0/4.7, 5.0/4.7) = (-6.4, 1.1) m/s. <img src=
  "small.gif" height="1" width="20"> (5)</p>

  <p>This agrees, within round-off error, with the applet value displayed in
  Figure 1.</p>

  <p>Note that to divide a vector by a scalar, one divides its <i>x</i> and
  <i>y</i> components separately by the scalar.</p>

  <p><b>Exercise 2</b>.  Transform result (4) into form (5) and vice versa.</p>

  <p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" alt="Back to Top"
  border="0" align= "top"></a></p>

  <div class="sectionheading">
    <a name="Mistake" id="Mistake">A Mistake to Avoid</a>
  </div>

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>.  Move the ball through two successive
  displacements <img src="d.gif" align= "bottom"><sub>1</sub> and <img
  src="d.gif" align="bottom"><sub>2</sub>, as in Figure 2 below, and
  determine the average speeds <i>v<sub>av,1</sub></i> and
  <i>v<sub>av,2</sub></i> and average velocities and <img src="v.gif"
  align="bottom"><sub>av,1</sub> and <img src="v.gif"
  align="bottom"><sub>av,2</sub> while these displacements take
  place.

  <p align="center"><img src="AvVelocitytwodispl.jpg"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

  <p>Let the intermediate point, reached after the first displacement,
  be labeled "C".  See Figure 2.</p>

  <p>Data related to the intermediate point C are not displayed by the
  applet once the second displacement has been carried out. You need
  to observe the time elapsed during the motion from the initial point
  to point C at the end of the first displacement. For the motion
  shown in Figure 2 this time elapsed is:</p>

  <p><img src="small.gif" height="1" width="10">time elapsed from the initial
  point to point C:</p>

  <p align="center"><i>t<sub>C</sub></i> = 2.5 s. <img src="small.gif" height=
  "1" width="40"> (6)</p>

  <p><b>Question 1</b>. What are the values of the average speed during the first
  and second displacements for the motion in Figure 2?</p>

  <p><b>Answer</b>. The calculations are analogous to the one leading to result
  (3). For the first displacement, using for the distance traveled the value
  |<i>x<sub>C</sub></i> - <i>x<sub>i</sub></i>| = |<i>x<sub>f</sub></i> -
  <i>x<sub>i</sub></i>| = |-13.5 - 10.0| = 23.5 m, and using value (6), we
  get</p>

  <p align="center"><i>v<sub>av,1</sub></i> = |<i>x<sub>C</sub></i> -
  <i>x<sub>i</sub></i>|/<i>t<sub>C</sub></i> = 23.5/2.5 = 9.4 m/s. <img src=
  "small.gif" height="1" width="20"> (7)</p>

  <p>For the second displacement, using for the distance traveled the value
  |<i>y<sub>f</sub></i> - <i>y<sub>C</sub></i>| = |<i>y<sub>f</sub></i> -
  <i>y<sub>i</sub></i>| = |9.6 - (-12.5)| = 22.1 m, and taking for the time
  elapsed <i>t</i> - <i>t<sub>C</sub></i> = 8.0 - 2.5 = 5.5 s, we get</p>

  <p align="center"><i>v<sub>av,2</sub></i> = |<i>y<sub>f</sub></i> -
  <i>y<sub>C</sub></i>|/(<i>t</i> - <i>t<sub>C</sub></i>) = 22.1/5.5 = 4.0 m/s.
  <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> (8)</p>

  <p><b>Question 2</b>. What are the values of the average velocity during the
  first and second displacements of the motion in Figure 2?</p>

  <p><b>Answer</b>. The calculations are based on Definition (1), and
  are analogous to calculation (5).  It is an exercise for you to
  verify that the answers, in (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)-components, are</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"><sub>av,1</sub> = (-9.4, 0)
  m/s <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (9)</p>

  <p>and</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom"><sub>av,2</sub> = (0, 4.0) m/s <img src="small.gif"
  height="1" width="40"> (10)</p>

  <p><b>Exercise 2</b>.  Determine the average speed
  <i>v</i><sub>av</sub> and average velocity <img src="v.gif"
  align="bottom"><sub>av</sub> for the entire movement created by you,
  combining both individual displacements.
  
  <p><b>Question 3</b>. What is the average speed for the entire movement,
  combining both individual displacements, for the motion in Figure 2?</p>

  <p><b>Answer</b>. It may be tempting to work out the answer by taking the
  arithmetic mean of the two individual average speeds (7) and (8). This would
  give the value</p>

  <p align="center">(<i>v<sub>av,1</sub></i> +
  <i>v<sub>av,2</sub></i>) = (9.4 + 4.0)/2 = 6.7 m/s. <img
  src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="20"> (11)</p>

  <p>However, this value is <b>incorrect</b> because average speed is
  <b>not</b> defined as a mean of two average speeds over shorter time
  intervals. The correct value as shown in Figure 2 is</p>

  <p align="center"><i>v<sub>av</sub></i> = 5.7 m/s. <img src="small.gif"
  height="1" width="40"> (12)</p>

  <p>To obtain value (12), use Definition (2) for the average speed. The total
  distance traveled is <i>s</i> = |<i>x<sub>C</sub></i> - <i>x<sub>i</sub></i>|
  + |<i>y<sub>f</sub></i> - <i>y<sub>C</sub></i>| = 23.5 + 22.1 = 45.6 m.
  Dividing this by the total time elapsed, 8.0 s, gives result (12).</p>

  <p><b>Question 4</b>. What is the average velocity for the entire
  movement, combining both the first and second displacements, for the
  motion in Figure 2?</p>

  <p><b>Answer</b>. Again, the correct answer is not equal to the mean
  of the two values (9) and (10). Work out this mean, and verify
  that it is not equal to the correct value for the average velocity
  <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub> =
  (-2.9, 2.8) m/s, shown in Figure 2.

  <p>Verify that this latter value is correct by using Definition (1),
  i.e., by dividing the total displacement, <img src="d.gif"
  alt="vector d" align="bottom"> = (-23.5, 22.1) m, by the total time
  elapsed, <i>t</i> = 8.0 s.</p>
