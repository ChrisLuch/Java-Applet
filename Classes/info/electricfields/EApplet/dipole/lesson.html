      Students will have an opportunity to review the definition of
      the electric field and the characteristics of the electric
      field due to a point charge. They will learn to construct the
      electric field due to two point charge sources as a
      superposition of the fields due to the individual point
      charge sources. They will have an opportunity to review the
      concept of electric potential, its relation to the electric
      field, and lines of equal electric potential and will learn
      about the patterns of such lines due to two point charge
      sources.

          Coulomb's law of electrostatics describes forces that two
          <b>point</b> particles exert on each other. A spherical
          object, like the source object in the present applet, is
          not a point particle, and Coulomb's law does not directly
          give the force exerted by a spherical object on a (point)
          particle. However, one can prove the following theorem
          which states that a charged sphere behaves like a point
          particle under certain conditions.

          <u>Comment 1</u>. Since the force <img src=
          "../images/F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"> is proportional to the
          charge <i>q</i>, the electric field <img src=
          "../images/E.gif" alt="vector E" align="bottom"> is independent of <i>q</i>
          and characterizes an "electric intensity" at the given
          point in space that is present without the test particle
          and does not depend on any properties of the test
          particle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 2</u>. The SI-unit of the electric field is
          N/C.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 3</u>. The electric field is defined at all
          points in space. It is therefore not a single vector, but
          a "vector-valued function defined on space". This simply
          means that to describe the electric field one must
          specify the vectors <img src="../images/E.gif" alt="vector E" align=
          "bottom"> at all points in space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 4</u>. An <i>electric field line</i> is a line
          (not a straight line in general) that indicates the
          direction of the electric field vectors at points along
          the line.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The electric field vector at a given point along an
          <i>electric field line</i> is tangential to the line at
          that point.

          A static electric field, i.e., a field accompanying one
          or more source charges at rest, has the property that it
          can be derived from a simpler field called the
          <i>electric potential</i>. The electric potential field
          is simpler because it is a scalar field, not a vector
          field like the electric field. The electric potential
          field assigns a scalar quantity to any given point in
          space called the <i>electric potential at that point</i>.
          The SI-unit of the electric potential is the volt (V).
        </p>
        <p>
          How can a scalar field give rise to a vector field? A
          static electric field is constructed from its electric
          potential field as follows.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Suppose you know the electric potential field and want to
          know the electric field vector at a given point P. Look
          at the electric potential in the neighborhood of P. Find
          the direction leading away from P in which the electric
          potential decreases more rapidly than in any other
          direction. This is the direction in which the electric
          vector at P points. 
          <p>
            The magnitude <i>E</i> of the electric vector at P is
            equal to the magnitude of the distance-rate-of-change
            of the electric potential,
          </p>
          <p align="center">

          <p>
            where |&Delta;<i>V</i>| / <i>d</i>
            is calculated in the direction of the electric field
            vector at P. Here |&Delta;<i>V</i>| equals |<i>V</i>(P') -
            <i>V</i>(P)| where P' is a point near P that lies in
            the direction of most rapid change of <i>V</i> away
            from P and <i>d</i> is the distance between P and P'.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the electric potential is constant throughout a
            small neighborhood of P or if the electric potential
            has a maximum or minimum at P, the electric field at P
            is zero.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 1</u>. Equation (5) implies the SI-unit V/m
          for the electric field. Another SI-unit for the
          electric field is N/C, as mentioned in Comment 2 under
          "Definition of Electric Field and Electric Field Lines"
          above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 2</u>. In general, the potential in the
          vicinity of a given point P will be decreasing in some
          directions, increasing in others, and remain constant
          along a line through P dividing the directions of
          decreasing and increasing potential. This dividing line
          is the "equipotential line" through P.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          An <i>equipotential line</i> is a line along which the
          electric potential is constant.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Such lines are not straight in general. In the present
          case of a point charge field, the equipotential lines are
          circles that have the point charge at their center.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that one is dealing with equipotential <b>lines</b>
          when considering only <b>two</b> dimensions. In three
          dimensions, one has equipotential <b>surfaces</b>. In the
          present case of a point charge field, the equipotential
          surfaces are spheres that have the point charge at their
          center.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 3</u>. The electric field vector at a given
          point is always perpendicular to the equipotential line
          through that point. As a consequence, electric field
          lines and equipotential lines cross at right angles at
          any given point.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 4</u>. Electric equipotential lines are
          analogous to lines of equal altitude on a topographic
          map. The steepest downhill direction is the direction in
          which these lines are closest together, i.e., the
          direction in which the altitude decreases most rapidly.
          This is the direction of the field vector.

          If several forces are acting on a particle, the force
          vectors must be added to give the total force acting on
          the particle. This is called <i>superposition of
          forces</i>.

        <p>
          In Definition (4) of the electric field <img src=

          <img src= "../images/F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom">
          acting on a test particle at a given point is the total
          electric force acting on the test particle. This total force
          is the sum of the forces due to all source charges creating
          the field. Therefore, the electric field vector at a given
          point is equal to the sum of the electric field vectors due

      What is the direction of the field vector at this point for

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Taking magnitudes on both sides of Definition

      Set one of the source charges equal to zero. That way, you
      will be looking at the electric field due to a single point

      Click on a point in the applet window to create a field point

      observe how the vector changes. Make sketches of what you
      observe, paying attention to both the magnitude and the
      direction of the electric field vector and the locations of
      the source and the field point. Are your observations about
      magnitude and direction of the field vector consistent with

    <p>
      Based on the Answer to Question 1 of the preceding section on
      "The Electric Field Due To A Point Charge", explain why the
      individual field vectors in Figure 1 due to the two source
      objects have the magnitudes and directions shown. No
      calculations are required, but you should explain why the red
      arrow is roughly twice as long as the blue arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the two individual field vectors, explain how one can
      obtain the total field vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Drag the field point, and observe how the
      total vector and the two individual vectors change. For two
      more positions of the field point, sketch your observations
      of the three vectors in your Notebook. Again, provide the
      same kinds of explanation as in Exercise 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may want to adjust the setting of the Vector Length
      Multiplier slider to have the field vectors represented by
      longer arrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Move the field point back to a position
      close to that shown in Figure 1 above. Independently vary the
      two source charges <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> and
      <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> while keeping the field point and the
      source objects fixed. For each of the following three cases,
      sketch the configurations of the field point with its three
      field vectors and the source objects. Indicate the values of
      the source charges.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> &gt; 0, <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> &gt; 0,
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> &gt; 0, <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> &lt; 0,

        <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> &lt; 0, <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> &lt; 0.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In each case, explain your observations for all three
      vectors. Although exact measurements of the distances of the
      field point from the source objects and of lengths of vector
      arrows are not required, judge these quantities by eye and
      explain your observations as quantitatively as possible.

      lines through these field points.

      Sketch the field pattern you observe. Compare it to the field

      For help with the explanation, move a field point along one

      <b>Question 1</b>. Which one of the three equipotential loops
      in Figure 4 has the largest electric potential, the innermost
      one or the outermost one?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The innermost loop has the largest potential
      because the electric field points from high to low potential.
      Note the direction of the field vector arrows in Figure 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. Based on the pattern of the three loops of
      constant electric potential, where along these loops is the
      magnitude <i>E</i> of the electric field the greatest?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. <i>E</i> is greatest where the lines of
      electric potential are closest together, i.e., where an
      imaginary line connecting the two source objects intersects
      the equipotential lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      If one calculates <i>E</i> at a field point using the values
      of the electric potential on two equipotential lines close to
      that field point, then the ratio &Delta;<i>V</i> / <i>d</i> will be largest at a
      point where the distance <i>d</i> between the equipotential
      lines has the smallest value.

    <p>
      <u>Comment</u>. The electric potential field due to two (or
      several) source charges is the superposition (sum) of the
      electric potential fields due to the individual source
      charges, as is true for the electric field. However, this
      superposition cannot be represented easily in graphical form
      because the electric potential is a scalar, not a vector like
      the electric field. It is, however, very useful in
      calculations. Adding scalars is easier than adding vectors.
