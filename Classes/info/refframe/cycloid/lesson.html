      <b>Prerequisites</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should understand displacement and velocity as
      vector quantities and be able to work with their components.
      Students should know basic trigonometry and the concept of
      angular velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Learning Outcomes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students will develop an understanding of rolling motion as a
      superposition of a constant-velocity translational motion and
      a uniform circular motion. In particular, they will learn
      that when a wheel is rolling on a surface without slipping
      the point on the perimeter of the wheel that momentarily is
      in contact with the surface has zero velocity relative to the
      surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should know how the applet functions, as described
      in Help and ShowMe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in
      the following text are to be done in the applet. You may need
      to toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if
      your screen space is limited.

      <b>Question 1</b>. When a round object is rolling on a surface
      without slipping, what is the velocity of a point on the
      perimeter of the object at the moment the point makes contact
      with the surface?  Here, "velocity" means velocity relative to
      the lab frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The round object could be a wheel, disk, cylinder, or sphere.
      In the case of the applet, it will be the central grey
      cylinder of the spool. It is rolling without slipping on the
      salmon-colored surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's find the answer by experimenting with the applet.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
       <p>
        <u>Experiment 1</u>. RESET the applet, and set the three
        sliders as follows:
       </p> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            angular speed (|<font face="symbol">w</font>|): 0.80
            rad/s
          </li>
          <li>
            center-to-point distance (<i>a</i>): 0.10 m
          </li>
          <li>
            inner radius of spool (<i>r</i>): 0.25 m
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Also, set the spool support to "Bottom" and select the
          Trace toggle button to display the revolving point's
          path.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the settings above, the revolving point is situated
          on the <b>inside</b> of the rolling grey cylinder. PLAY
          the motion, and observe the path of the revolving point.
          You should obtain a wavy path form as shown in Figure 1
          below. In the snapshot in Figure 1, the spool is rolling
          to the right.
        </p>

          <b>Figure 1</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The velocity <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">
          of the revolving point relative to the Lab frame is a vector
          that points along the tangent to the revolving point's
          path. In what direction is this velocity when the revolving
          point is at its lowest point? Is the velocity zero perhaps?
        </p>
        <p>
          You can let the applet display the answer by checking
          "Velocity v of revolving point relative to lab frame" on the
          vector panel and stopping the motion when the revolving
          point is at its lowest point. The velocity vector <img
          src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> (green) is shown
          in Figure 2 below.

        <u>Experiment 2</u>. RESET the applet, and set the sliders as
        follows:
       </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            angular speed (|<font face="symbol">w</font>|): 0.80
            rad/s
          </li>
          <li>
            center-to-point distance (<i>a</i>): 0.40 m
          </li>
          <li>
            inner radius of spool (<i>r</i>): 0.25 m
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
		  Compared to the settings used in Experiment 1, only the
        center-to-point distance (<i>a</i>) is changed.  It is changed
        from 0.10 m to 0.40 m.  Make sure that the spool support is
        still set to "Bottom".
      </p> 
        <p>
          The revolving point is now situated on the <b>outside</b>
          of the rolling cylinder. PLAY the motion, and observe the
          path of the revolving point. You should obtain a looping
          path form as shown in Figure 3 below. In the snapshot in
          Figure 3 the spool is rolling to the <b>right</b>.

          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        This time, the center-to-point distance (<i>a</i>) is set to
        0.25 m and the revolving point is on the perimeter of the
        inner cylinder which is rolling on the support rail.  Make
        sure the spool support is set to "Bottom" as before.
      </p>
        <p>
          PLAY the motion, and observe the path of the revolving
          point. You should obtain a path form with cusps as shown
          in Figure 5 below.

             alt="vector v" align="bottom"> now when the revolving
             point is at its lowest point? Is the velocity zero?
        </p>
        <p>
          A cusp is a point where the two branches of the
          trajectory just before and after the cusp point become
          parallel to each other. In the present case, the two
          branches approach vertical directions as they approach
          the cusp point. Therefore the velocity of the revolving
          point must approach a vertically downward direction upon
          approaching the cusp point and leave the cusp point with
          a vertically upward direction. Velocity is continuous.
          The velocity cannot jump from one direction to the exact
          opposite direction at the cusp point, <b>unless</b> the
          velocity is zero at the cusp point.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Figure 5, the velocity vector <img src="v.gif"
             alt="vector v" align="bottom"> at the cusp point has
             degenerated to a green dot, which means that the velocity
             is zero.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>Summary</b>. The velocity of the revolving point at the
      bottom of the point's path is
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        in the direction of motion of the spool when <i>a</i> &gt;
        <i>r</i>,
      </li>
      <li>
        opposite to the direction of motion of the spool when
        <i>a</i> &lt;
        <i>r</i>,
      </li>
      <li>
        in between the two directions above, i.e., zero, when
        <i>a</i> = <i>r</i>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Thus a point on the perimeter of a rolling object has zero
      velocity relative to the surface the object is rolling on when
      the point makes contact with the surface. When the velocity of a
      point on the perimeter of a rolling object is <b>not</b> zero
      upon contact with the surface the object is rolling, the motion
      is not pure rolling motion but is rolling combined with
      slipping.

      A further explanation of this is provided in the next section.

      Rolling Motion as Superposition of Two Motions
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <b>Superposition of two motions</b>. Relative to the lab frame,
      the revolving point is carrying out two motions at once: a
      translational motion with constant velocity <img src="u.gif"
      alt="vector u" align="bottom"> and a uniform circular motion
      around the center of the spool with instantaneous velocity <img
      src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">' relative to the
      frame translating with the spool.
      <br><br>
        Relative to the lab frame, the displacement of the revolving
        point during a given time interval is the vector sum of its
        displacements according to these two other motions, and the
        revolving point's velocity <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
        align="bottom"> relative to the lab frame at a given instant
        is the vector sum of its velocities at that instant due to the
        two other motions. Thus: <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
        align="bottom"> = <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
        align="bottom">' + <img src="u.gif" alt="vector u"
        align="bottom">.  This equation has the name <i>Galilean
        velocity transformation</i>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet, and make the following
      settings.  Make sure the spool support is set to "Bottom".
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        angular speed (|<font face="symbol">w</font>|): 0.80 rad/s
      </li>
      <li>
        center-to-point distance (<i>a</i>): 0.25 m
      </li>
      <li>
        inner radius of spool (<i>r</i>): 0.25 m
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      PLAY and REVERSE the motion with the path displayed. Also
      display the velocity vectors <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
      align="bottom">' (yellow) and <img src="u.gif" alt="vectur u"
      align="bottom"> (red). If you stop the motion when the revolving
      point is at the bottom of its path while the spool is moving
      left, you should get a display like that in Figure 6 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="RollingMotionBottom.gif" alt=
      "Velocities at Bottom">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 6</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Figure 6 shows that at the cusp point, the velocities
      <img src="u.gif" alt="vector u" align="bottom"> and
         <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">' are equal
         in magnitude and opposite in direction. Thus, their vector
         sum, i.e., the velocity <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
         align="bottom"> relative to the lab frame, is zero.
    </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>.  It is clear that, if the spool is moving
      left, the velocity <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
      align="bottom">' of the revolving point when it is at the bottom
      is opposite to <img src="u.gif" alt="vector u" align="bottom">.
      However, why is the magnitude of <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
      align="bottom">' equal to the magnitude of <img src="u.gif"
      alt="vector u" align="bottom">?
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Answer</b>.  Imagine the surface of the spool's inner
      cylinder to be covered with ink like the ball of a ballpoint
      pen.  When the spool is rolling on its support surface, the
      surface will get painted with this ink.  
    </p>
	 <p>
		If the spool is rolling without slipping, the distance on the
      support surface that gets painted when the spool makes one
      revolution is equal to the circumference <i>c</i> of the spool's
      inner cylinder.  Let <i>T</i> denote the time required for one
      revolution.  Then <i>u</i> = <i>c</i> / <i>T</i>, and <i>v</i>'
      = <i>c</i> / <i>T</i> as well because in the frame of reference
      translating with the spool the revolving point performs circular
      motion and moves a distance <i>c</i> around the circle in time
      <i>T</i>.  Therefore, <i>u</i> = <i>v'</i>.
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. What is the revolving point's velocity
      relative to the lab frame at the top of the point's path if the
      spool is moving left?
    </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Answer</b>.  At all points along the revolving point's path,
        <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> = <img
        src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">' + <img src="u.gif"
        alt="vector u" align="bottom">.  At the top of the point's
        path, <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">' = <img
        src="u.gif" alt="vector u" align="bottom">.  Therefore, <img
        src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> = 2<img src="u.gif"
        alt="vector u" align="bottom">, which means that <img
        src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> points left and has
        a magnitude equal to 2<i>u</i>.  Check this with the applet.
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. RESET the applet, and make the following
      settings.  Make sure the spool support is set to "Bottom".
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

    <p>
      <u><i>x</i>' and <i>y</i>'</u>. Let's start with <i>x</i>'
      and <i>y</i>'. These are the coordinates of the revolving
      point in a coordinate system that has its origin at the
      center C of the spool. The right-angle triangle in Figure 9
      below illustrates how these coordinates are defined.

      These expressions are true also for angles greater than
      90<sup>o</sup> and even for negative angles. They are true
      for angles with values anywhere on the real axis. We need
      this range here. The angle <font face="symbol">q</font> is
      the angle between the positive <i>x</i>-axis and the radius
      vector from the center of the spool to the revolving point.
      This angle can keep on increasing forever or decreasing
      forever as the spool is rolling left or right, respectively.
      (When the spool is rolling to the right, the radius vector is
      rotating clockwise so that <font face="symbol">q</font> is
      decreasing.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We need the concept of angular velocity. You can review it under
      <a href="#Definitions">Definitions of an Angle's Radian Measure
      and of Angular Velocity</a> in the Appendix.
    </p>
    <p>
      The angular velocity <font face="symbol">w</font> with which the
      spool is rotating is constant. In the present case, with the
      spool rolling to the right and rotating clockwise, <font
      face="symbol">w</font> is negative because <font face=
      "symbol">q</font> is decreasing.  Note that the applet slider
      labeled "Angular Speed" sets the <b>magnitude</b> of the angular
      velocity.

		Since <i>t</i> = 0 at the beginning of the motion, the time
      elapsed until time <i>t</i> is equal to <nobr><i>t</i> - 0 =
      <i>t</i>.</nobr> Figure 7 shows that <font face=
      "symbol">q</font> = 0 at <i>t</i> = 0 so that the change <font
      face= "symbol">Dq</font> in angle until time <i>t</i> when the
      angle is <font face= "symbol">q</font> is equal to <font face=

    </p>
    <p>
      This value of <i>x</i>' is consistent with that displayed in
      Figure 8. It is the Reader's job to calculate <i>y</i>'.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u><i>X</i> and <i>Y</i></u>. Next let's calculate the position
      coordinates of the spool's center. <i>Y</i> is always zero, so
      there is nothing to do there. <i>X</i> requires more work, but
      the calculation is instructive.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be easy to calculate <i>X</i> if we knew the velocity
      <img src="u.gif" alt="vector u" align="bottom">. We know that
      its direction is horizontal and to the right. From the
      discussion in the answer to Question 1 above, we know that its
      magnitude <i>u</i> is equal to <i>c</i> / <i>T</i> where
      <i>c</i> is the circumference of the spool's inner cylinder and
      <i>T</i> is the period of revolution of the spool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumference <i>c</i> of the inner cylinder is equal to
      2<font face="symbol">p</font><i>r</i>. With that, the speed
      <i>u</i> of the spool, (distance traveled)/(time elapsed), is
      equal to
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>u</i> = 2<font face="symbol">p</font><i>r</i>/<i>T</i> .
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40"> (6)
    </p>
    <p>
      We need to relate <i>u</i> to the angular velocity <font
      face="symbol">w</font>.  The angular speed |<font
      face="symbol">w</font>| is constant and therefore can be
      evaluated by dividing the angle corresponding to one revolution,
      2<font face= "symbol">p</font> rad, by the period
      <i>T</i>. Remember that the angular velocity <font
      face="symbol">w</font> is negative in the present case. Putting
      all this together gives
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <font face="symbol">w</font> = - 2<font face=
      "symbol">p</font><i>r</i>/<i>T</i> .<img src="small.gif"
         alt="space" height="1" width="40"> (7)
    </p>
    <p>
      With this equation, Equation (6) can be written
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>u</i> = 2<font face="symbol">p</font><i>r</i>/<i>T</i> =
      (2<font face="symbol">p</font>/<i>T</i>) <i>r</i> = -
      (-2<font face="symbol">p</font>/<i>T</i>) <i>r</i> = -
      <font face="symbol">w</font><i>r</i>. <img src="small.gif"
      alt="space" height="1" width="40"> (8)
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the spool's speed is proportional to both the rate at
      which the spool rotates and the radius of the spool's inner
      cylinder. This makes sense intuitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      With <font face="symbol">w</font> = - 0.80 rad/s and <i>r</i>
      = 0.25 m, Expression (8) gives
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>u</i> = - (-0.80)&times;0.25 = 0.20 m/s . <img src=
      "small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40"> (9)
    </p>
    <p>
      With this value for <i>u</i> and the time elapsed <i>t</i> =
      4.57 s, we get the displacement <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>X</i> of the center of the spool as
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <font face="symbol">D</font><i>X</i> = <i>u t</i> =
      0.20&times;4.57 = 0.914 m . <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40"> (10)
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding <font face="symbol">D</font><i>X</i> to the value of
      <i>X</i> at <i>t</i> = 0 gives the value of <i>X</i> at
      <i>t</i> = 4.57 s,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>X</i> = <i>X</i>(0) + <font face="symbol">D</font><i>X</i>
      = 1.59 + 0.914 = 2.504 m .<img src="small.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40"> (11)
    </p>
    <p>
      This is consistent with the value of 2.51 m shown in Figure 8 if
      one takes into consideration that the value <i>X</i>(0) = 1.59 m
      shown in Figure 7 is rounded to two decimals.  It may well be
      rounded to this value from 1.593 m.  With <i>X</i>(0) = 1.593 m,
      <i>X</i> would become 1.593 + 0.914 = 2.507 m, which would round
      to the value of 2.51 m shown in Figure 8.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u><i>x</i> and <i>y</i></u>. Finally, we need to calculate
      the coordinates of the revolving point relative to the lab
      frame. Given the previous results, this task is easy if we
      recognize that the motion of the revolving point relative to
      the lab frame is the superposition of the revolving motion
      around the center of the spool and the translational motion
      of the center of the spool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of our choice of coordinate origins, common origin of
      the (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) and (<i>X</i>,<i>Y</i>) coordinate and
      origin of the (<i>x</i>',<i>y</i>') coordinates at the center of
      the spool, the superposition of the two motions implies simply

      where the coordinates in these equations are all evaluated at

      It is left as an exercise for the Reader to substitute into
      Equations (12) the values for <i>x</i>', <i>X</i>, <i>y</i>',
      <i>Y</i> determined already, and compare the resulting values of
      <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> with those shown in Figure 8.

      The definition of the radian measure of an angle does not
      involve time, but is given here in a context involving
      motion, the same context as that used for the definition of
      angular velocity.

      The quantities needed are listed below and are illustrated in
      Figure A1. The Figure shows a green dot which represents a
      particle or point on a rotating object. The particle is
      assumed to be moving in a circle. If we need to deal with a
      rolling object, we must imagine the circle to be co-moving
      with the object and the following considerations to be in the
      reference frame in which the center of the rolling object is
      at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle in which the particle or point on a rotating
      object is moving is thinly outlined. The center C of the
      circle is the vertex of the angle to be measured. We will
      refer to the vector from C to the particle as the <i>radius
      vector</i>. Its magnitude, i.e., the radius of the circle, is
      denoted <i>r</i>.

      By substituting Expression (A1) for <font face=

      So far, everything has been in the frame of reference in
      which the center C of the circle is at rest. The speed
      <i>v</i> in Equation (A6) has been the speed of a point on a
      circle of radius <i>r</i>, and this point has been moving
      with angular speed |<font face="symbol">w</font>| around
      point C.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Equation (A6) also can be applied to a rolling
      object. In this case, <i>v</i> can be interpreted as the
      speed of the center C of the rolling object relative to the
      Lab frame while |<font face="symbol">w</font>| is the same
      angular speed of rotation as before. The reason why Equation
      (A6) can be interpreted this way is as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we have a rolling disk. Imagine a tape to be wound
      around the perimeter of the disk. This tape unrolls as the
      disk rolls along. A length of tape equal to the disk's
      circumference will unroll as the disk makes one revolution,
      and this is how far the center of the disk moves forward at
      the same time. More generally, during a time interval
      <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> in which a point on the
      perimeter of the disk moves a distance <i>s</i> from P to P'
      (see Figure A1) in the frame in which C is at rest, the
      center C moves forward an equal distance <i>s</i> relative to
      the Lab frame. Dividing by <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>t</i>, this implies that the speed of the
      point on the perimeter of the disk relative to point C is
      equal to the speed of point C relative to the lab frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equation (A6) when applied to a rolling object is the
      "no-slipping" condition because the equation was derived
      assuming pure rolling motion. At which point in the
      derivation was the assumption of rolling without slipping
      necessary?
    </p>

      <b>Exercise</b>. Verify that Equations (A5) and (A6) are
      correct dimensionally.
