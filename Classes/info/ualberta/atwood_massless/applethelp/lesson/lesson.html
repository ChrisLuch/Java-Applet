<p><span class="general">This lesson will give you practice using the concepts 
  of energy conservation and energy transformation.</span> 
<p><span class="general">The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions 
  in this lesson are to be carried out in the applet. You may need to toggle back 
  and forth between instructions and applet if your screen space is limited. You 
  should be prepared to do calculations to verify the numbers that are generated 
  by the applet. </span>

        <p>In order to assign a numerical value to the potential energy of a body 
          it is first necessary to define a &quot;zero point&quot; or reference 
          level at which the potential energy is considered to be 0 J. You do 
          this on the applet by repositioning the Ep Reference line by moving 
          it up or down. To see how this works, position the Ep Reference line 
          to be at the same height as the center of the pulley as shown on the 
          right. Set mass 1 to equal 250 g and mass 2 to be 750 g.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Are the initial potential energies for mass 1 and mass 2 positive, 
            negative or zero in this case? Explain your answer.</li>

            Calculate the change in potential energy for each mass. Recall that

            ) and this time put the Ep Reference line through the yellow dot which 
            represents the center of mass for mass1. When released, mass 1 will 
            move above this line and its Ep will increase. Since mass 2 is already 
            above this line and it drops, its Ep will start at its maximum value 
            and then decrease. Calculate the initial potential energy for mass 
            2 relative to this new Ep Reference line and use the applet to verify 
            your calculation (hint: redo the graphs that you created in question 
            2). What is the initial potential energy for mass 2?<br>

          <li>Combine the initial potential energy for each mass (Ep1 + Ep2). 
            This represents the initial potential energy for the system. What 
            is this energy. Run the applet. Now, what is the potential energy 
            of the system? Are these two energies the same?<br>

  <h2><a name="total"></a>Total Mechanical Energy of a System and Conservation

  <p class="general">The applet Atwood assumes that there is no loss of energy 
    from the system. This means that there is no frictional loss in the pulley 
    and that air resistance on the moving masses can be ignored. It is assumed 
    that energy is conserved. When this happens we can conclude that the total 
    energy of the system is constant. This can expressed in the following ways:</p>
