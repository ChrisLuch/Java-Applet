<h1>How to Use FreeBody Drawer and Editor</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to Open and Use a Project</h2>
<p>This is easy. Just click on the projects tab and select the appropriate listed 
  project. In the sample shown below, you have 5 possible projects to choose from. 
  The left hand column gives the user editing control over the vectors that you 
  draw on the image which appears. After you have loaded a project, follow these 
  simple steps:</p>
<table width="95%" border="0">
  <tr> 
    <td width="55%"><img src="../applethelp1/img4.png" width="501" height="457"></td>
    <td width="45%" valign="top"> 
      <ul>
        <li>To draw a new vector make sure the &quot;draw vectors&quot; radio 
          button is selected.</li>
        <li>To name a vector type in the text box on the top, right hand side. 
          Press enter and the name will appear in the text area, lower right.</li>
        <li>To change the colour of the vector press the colour icon at the top 
          right and select desired colour.</li>
        <li>To change the length or direction of the vector select the set vector 
          head(s) button. A small circular hot-spot will appear and you can drag 
          the vector by placing the mouse over this point and dragging.</li>
        <li>To change the location of the vector choose the set vector origin(s) 
          button and repeat the above.</li>
        <li>To delete a vector select it with either of the last two buttons and 
          then press the &quot;X&quot; button. Rreset removes ALL vectors.</li>
        <li>After you have drawn your FBD press the done button. The FBD icon 
          will now become active and you can press this to see the instructor 
          drawn FBD.</li>
        <li>The button labeled FBD's will expose a visual menu of the FBD's in 
          your project. You can load any one of these scenarios by clicking on 
          them. </li>
      </ul>

<h1>How to Make a Project - Using FreeBody Editor</h1>
<h2>Getting Started </h2>
<p>The editor uses the same interface that is used in FreeBodyDrawer. The only 
  difference is contained in the controls which appear under theFile menu selection. 
  The following figure illustrates the editor side menu:</p>
<table width="95%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="65%"><img src="img5.png" width="605" height="458"></td>
    <td width="35%" align="left" valign="top">
      <p>Use new project to start a brand new project file (see the note following 
        this on file stucture)</p>
      <p>Open project allows you to open an existing project file and import project 
        allows you to combine existing projects.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Project Files and the Underlying File Stucture</h2>
<table width="93%" border="1">
  <tr> 
    <td width="24%"><img src="img1.png" width="180" height="118" border="2" align="left"></td>
    <td width="76%"> 
      <p>It is essential that all FBD files be contained in a common folder (called 
        projects in this example). Each project is a combination of a project 
        file (created by the editor when you save the project) and an image file. 
        It is important that the image file have a specific name of the format: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>project file: <i><b>filename</b></i></p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>project image file folder: <i><b>filename_images</b></i></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="24%"><img src="img2.png" width="125" height="204"></td>
    <td width="76%" valign="top">Notice, for example that project_1 is accompanied 
      by the folder project_1_images. You can assign any valid name you wish to 
      the project file but you must also store all images for that project in 
      an appropriately named folder.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="24%">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="76%">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>The HTML Parameters that call Your Projects</h2>
<p>The HTML file which calls FreeBodyDrawer contains a parameter setting that 
  names the projects that you wish to load. This may seem cumbersome but it allows 
  the user to set up different instances of the applet that call only the projects 
  you wish. A sample code snippet is shown below:</p>
<p align="center">&lt;PARAM NAME = &quot;projects&quot; VALUE =&quot;project_1,project_2&quot;&gt; 
</p>
<p>In this example only the projects named project_1 and project_2 would be loaded 
  by the applet FreeBodyDrawer. Note carefully how you change the HTML file. Every 
  instance of the project parameter must be changed to reflect the projects you 
  wish to load. Since this applet uses the Sun plugin, there are 4 different locations 
  in the file that need to be changed. It is recommended that you make a back 
  up of the file before editing it and inspec the file carefully before hand so 
  that you see where the project params are called.</p>
