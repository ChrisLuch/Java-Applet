<h1>Getting to Know the Applet</h1>
<p><span class="general">Spend a little time &quot;playing&quot; with the applet. 
  Try adjusting the speed of the car, coefficient of friction and angle of the 
  roadway (the &quot;bank angle&quot;). Observe under what conditions the car 
  will either skid inward or outward and what you need to do to counteract this.</span></p>
<p><span class="general">Once you have run the applet a few times you should explore 
  the forces acting on the car. Toggle the force button and show the free-body 
  diagram. Again observe how the forces change with varying speed, coefficient 
  of friction or bank angle.</span></p>
<p class="question">Question</p>
<p class="general">Explain why the free-body diagram only shows three forces acting 
  on the car (We are ignoring air resistance here)</p>
<p class="question">Question</p>
<p class="general">What force or forces cause the car to round the corner and 
  in what direction do these forces act?</p>
<p class="question">Question</p>
<p class="general">During an outward skid, does a force cause the car to skid 
  outward? If so, identify this force?</p>
