<p><span class="rightanswer">Since F = ma and we know a, we can re-write this 
  as m = F/a. The info panel tells us that the inward or centripetal force needed 
  is 2812.5 N and since a = 2.812 m/s<sup>2</sup>, it follows that the mass of 
  the car is:</span></p>
<p><span class="rightanswer">m = 2812.5 N/ 2.812 m/s<sup>2</sup> = 1000 kg.</span></p>
<p class="rightanswer">(Of course, you could also use the weight of the car as 
  given and also deduce the mass as 1000 kg.)</p>
