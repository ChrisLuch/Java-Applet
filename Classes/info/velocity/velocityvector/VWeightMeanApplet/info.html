          The Data toggle button lets you display/hide the Data box.
          The box can be dragged to a convenient location by clicking
          on it and dragging.  The green scroll bar on the right lets
          you scroll through the list of bins.
	</p>
	<p>
          The Data box contains information in numerical form that the
          graph of accumulated time vs. speed shown below displays
          graphically.
	</p>
	<p align="center">
         <img src="WeightedAverageGraph.gif" alt="Weighted Average Graph">
	</p>
	<p>
          The five columns of the Data box contain the following information.
	</p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <u>Column 1: Bin Number</u>.  The speed of the moving object
	 (car) can be varied between 0 and 50 m/s.  This interval can
	 be divided into a number of equally wide bins by using the
	 Number-of-Bins slider.  The bins are numbered starting with
	 No.0 for the bin with the smallest speeds including 0 m/s.
	 (The information for Bin 0 is not visible in the image of the
	 Data box above.  
	 </li>
	 <li>
          <u>Column 2: Accumulated Time <i>t</i> in s</u>. The
	 object's speed can be varied.  In general, if the motion is
	 observed during a time interval of duration <i>T</i>, the
	 object's speed takes on values that lie in different bins,
	 sometimes returning to values in a given bin repeatedly.  The
	 Accumulated Time for a bin is the total time elapsed within
	 the time interval <i>T</i> during which the object's speed
	 has a value in the given bin.  The total of all accumulated
	 bin times is equal to time <i>T</i> and is listed at the
	 bottom of Column 2.  
	 </li> 
	 <li>
          <u>Column 3: Bin Interval in m/s</u>.  This is the range of
	 speeds for a given bin.  The range is open on the left and
	 closed on the right.  E.g., in the image of the Data box
	 above, Bin 4 is the speed interval (8.0,10.0].  It contains
	 all speeds between 8.0 m/s and 10.0 m/s, not including 8.0
	 m/s but including 10.0 m/s.  The Bin-0 interval, containing
	 the value 0 m/s, is closed at both ends. Notice the rounded
	 parentheses to denote the open end of the interval and the
	 square parentheses for the closed end.  
	 </li> 
	 <li>
          <u>Column 4: Bin Speed <i>v</i> in m/s</u>.  This is the
	 speed at the mid-point of the bin.  E.g., the bin speed for
	 Bin 4 is equal to 9.0 m/s.  
	 </li>
	 <li>
          <u>Column 5: <i>v</i>*<i>t</i> in m</u>.  This is the
	 product of the bin speed <i>v</i> and the accumulated time
	 <i>t</i> for a given bin.  It is equal to the distance that
	 would have been traveled by the object if it had maintained
	 the bin speed throughout the amount of accumulated time
	 <i>t</i>.  The total bin distance <i>s<sub>bin</sub></i>,
	 which is the sum of the distances <i>v</i>*<i>t</i> for all
	 bins, is listed at the bottom of Column 5.  
	 </li> 
	 </ul>
	<p>
         Below the five columns and the Totals of Columns 2 and 5,
         three additional values are listed:
        </p>
	<p>
         <ul>
	  <li>
           <u>Distance traveled (exact value)</u>.  This is the total
	  distance <i>s</i> traveled in the entire time interval
	  <i>T</i>.  It is in general not equal to the the sum
	  <i>s<sub>bin</sub></i> of the bin distances
	  <i>v</i>*<i>t</i>.  
	  </li>
	  <li>
	   <u>Bin Speed Average</u>.  This is equal to the total bin
	  distance <i>s<sub>bin</sub></i> divided by the total
	  accumulated time <i>T</i>.  
	  </li> 
	  <li>
	   <u>Average Speed (exact value)</u>.  This is the true value
         of the average speed.  The bin speed average would be equal
         to it if one took infinitely many bins of vanishing width.
         </li> 
	</ul>

          The two sliders in the control panel allow you to adjust

        </p>
	<ul>
          <li>
          <u>Number of Bins</u>.  The number of bins into which the
         speed interval from 0 to 50 m/s can be divided can be set to
         any number from 1 to 50 by means of this slider.  All bins
         have the same width.  
	  </li> 
          <li>
          <u>Speed</u>. The moving object (car) can move
          counter-clockwise or clockwise on an oval track.  The speed
          of the motion is set by the Speed Slider.  The range of the
          speed is from 0 to 50.0 m/s, in steps of 0.1 m/s.

         When the Speed vs. Time checkbox is checked, a graph of the

	<p align="center"> 
	  <img src="SpeedTimeGraph.gif" alt="Speed vs. Time Graph">
        </p>
	<p>
         The graph displays two curves: instantaneous speed vs. time
         in red and average speed from the beginning of the motion up
         to the given instant in blue.  In an interval where the
         latter is equal to the former, the blue graph representing
         the latter is covered up by the red graph representing the
         former.  In the image above, this is the case in the initial
         interval from <i>t</i> = 0 to approximately <i>t</i> = 11 s.
        </p>
	<p>
         The graph also indicates the average speed over the entire
         time interval by a horizontal blue line and a corresponding
         value on the vertical axis.
	</p>
	<p>
          When the Accumulated Time vs. Speed checkbox is checked, the
         graph of Accumulated Time vs. Speed is displayed as in the
