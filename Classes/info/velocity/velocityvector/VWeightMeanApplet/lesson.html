      The Average of Two Speeds
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. A car goes around an oval track at a speed
      of 20 m/s. Upon completing the first round, the car increases
      its speed very quickly (let's assume instantaneously to make
      the calculation easier) to 40 m/s and then goes around the
      track the second time at 40 m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the car's average speed over the two rounds?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. It may be tempting to say 30 m/s. After all,
      the mean of 20 and 40 is 30. However, that would not be the
      right answer because average speed is not defined as an
      arithmetic mean of speeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Definition of Average Speed</u>
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      average speed = (distance traveled) / (time elapsed)
    </p>
    <p>
      Before doing the calculation based on this definition, use
      the applet to determine the average speed "experimentally".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Simulate the car's motion with the applet
      by setting the speed to 20 m/s, letting the car complete one
      round, pausing the motion, resetting the speed to 40 m/s, and
      letting the car complete the second round and pausing the
      motion again. You may not be able to pause the motion exactly
      after the car has completed a round, which will introduce a
      slight error.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the car's speed vs. time graph during the motion by
      checking the Speed vs. Time checkbox. Observe that the
      average speed changes continually during the second round,
      but that at no time during that round it is equal to 30 m/s.
      The average speed is always <b>less</b> than 30 m/s, and you
      should find that upon completion of the second round it is
      around 26.7 m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Copy the graph of speed vs. time for the
      two rounds into your Notebook. Evaluate the area under the
      graph for the first round. The area is equal to
      height&times;base of the rectangle, i.e., equal to
      speed&times;(time elapsed). This is the distance traveled by
      the car in the first round, i.e., the distance around the
      oval track (approximately, since you may not have paused the
      motion after exactly one round).
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeat this calculation for the second round. You should find
      that the rectangle is twice as high, but only half as wide,
      resulting in the same distance traveled (approximately).
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe where the applet has drawn the average speed. Enter
      this horizontal line into your graph and verify that the area
      under the average speed graph is equal to the distance
      traveled by the car when going around the oval twice. Thus,
      the average speed line is drawn at a level such that the
      definition above of average speed is satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Calculate the average speed for the two
      rounds assuming a speed of 20 m/s was maintained for exactly
      one round and a speed of 40 m/s for the second round. The
      distance <i>s</i> around the oval is not given because it is
      not needed. Work with the symbol <i>s</i> for this distance
      in your calculation. (If you find this difficult, use
      <i>s</i> = 500 m. The value of the average speed should not
      depend on what value for <i>s</i> you assume.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Solution</b>. We need the total distance traveled and the
      total time elapsed. The total distance traveled is 2<i>s</i>.
      The time elapsed during the first round is <i>s</i>/(20 m/s).
      The time elapsed during the second round is <i>s</i>/(40
      m/s). Thus, the total time <i>T</i> elapsed is
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "100"><i>T</i> = <i>s</i>[1/20 + 1/40] =
      <i>s</i>&times;60/800 = <i>s</i>&times;3/40. <img src=
      "small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40">(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      This gives for the average speed

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Repeat Exercise 1 with two new speed
      settings for the car, making sure the car travels the same
      distances for speed 1 and speed 2. Calculate the value of the
      average speed as in Exercise 3, and compare the result with
      that shown by the applet.

      Average Speed as a Time-Weighted Average
    </div>
    <p>
      In the previous section, you calculated the average speed for
      a motion where two different speeds were maintained over
      equal distances. What if the distances are not equal? A more
      general expression for the average speed will now be derived
      that applies in all cases where a motion is performed at two
      different speeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the two speeds be denoted by <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> and
      <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>, the distances traveled at these speeds
      by <i>s</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>s</i><sub>2</sub>, and the
      times elapsed while these speeds are maintained by
      <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, respectively.
      The total distance traveled is <i>s</i><sub>1</sub> +
      <i>s</i><sub>2</sub> and the total time <i>T</i> elapsed is
      <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>. With that, the
      definition of average speed gives

    </p>
    <p>
      In Expression (3) for the average speed, each speed is
      multiplied by a factor equal to the fraction of the total
      time during which the speed is maintained. This factor is a
      called a <i>weighting factor</i> and this kind of an average
      is called a <i>time-weighted average</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equ.(3) requires the times and speeds to be known. If instead
      of the times the distances are known, substitute for the
      times the expressions

    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. Is it ever true that the average speed
      over a motion that consists of two different speeds
      <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>v</i><sub>2</sub> is equal to the
      arithmetic mean (<i>v</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>)
      / 2?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Yes, when the factors
      (<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>/<i>T</i>) and
      (<i>t</i><sub>2</sub>/<i>T</i>) in Equ.(3) are equal to 1/2.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the case when the times <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and
      <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> elapsed during which the two speeds are
      maintained are equal. This is <b>not</b> the case when the
      two speeds are maintained over equal <b>distances</b>, as in
      Question 1 of the preceding section. The times taken to cover
      the same distance will be different when the car is moving at
      different speeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Use Equ.(3) to calculate the average speed
      for the situation dealt with in Question 1 of the preceding
      section. A car went around an oval track at a speed of 20 m/s
      and then a second time at 40 m/s. Calculate the car's average
      speed for the two rounds using Equ.(3). Try it yourself
      before looking at the following answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Since the car goes twice as fast the second
      time around, its travel time for the second round is half
      that for the first round. Therefore,

    </p>
    <p>
      This is the result obtained in Equ.(2) of Exercise 3 of the
      preceding section.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Reset the applet. Set the car's speed to 15.0
      m/s.  Keep the number of bins at 25. Make sure both the Speed
      vs.  Time graph and the Accumulated Time vs. Speed graph are
      <b>not</b> displayed. Do display the Data box, and scroll its
      display so that Bins 7 and 14 are simultaneously on display.
      These bins contain the speeds 15 m/s and 30 m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play the car's motion, and Pause it when the Accumulated Time
      in Bin 7 is 10.0 s or close to it. Then set the car's speed
      to 30.0 m/s. Play the car's motion, and Pause it when the
      Accumulated Time in Bin 14 is 30.0 s or close to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use Equ.(3) to calculate the average speed for the actual
      times elapsed in your experiment, which will be close to 10 s
      and 30 s for the two speeds. Compare your result to the
      "Average Speed (exact value)" at the bottom of the Data box.

    <p>
      <b>Sample calculation</b>. Figure 1 below shows values
      similar to those that you might obtain.

    <p>
      This is the value shown at the bottom of the Data box in
      Figure 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Important Comment</u>. In addition to the exact value (7)
      of the average speed the applet also calculates a <i>bin
      speed average</i>, which in this case comes out to 25.51 m/s.
      This value is obtained as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet divides the available speed range from 0 to 50 m/s
      into bins of equal size. At present, with the number of bins
      equal to 25, each bin has a width of 50/25 = 2 m/s. The bins
      are numbered 0 to 24. Bin 7 covers the interval (14.0,16.0]
      m/s. This interval is open at the left and therefore does not
      include 14.0 m/s, but is closed on the right and does include
      16.0 m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>bin speed</i>, the speed at the midpoint of a bin, is
      representative for all speeds in that bin. Bin 7 has 15 m/s
      at its midpoint, so 15 m/s is the bin speed. Bin 14 covers
      the interval (28.0,30.0] m/s and has the bin speed 29.0 m/s.
      The bin speed average is the time-weighted average bin speed
      calculated according to Equ.(3). In the present case, the bin
      speed average is

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, hide the Data
      box and display the Accumulated Time vs. Speed graph instead.
      The graph representing the data from Figure 1 is shown in
      Figure 2 below.
    </p>

      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The bin speed of 15.0 m/s is shown with an accumulated time
      indistinguishable from 10 s and the bin speed of 29.0 m/s
      with an accumulated time indistinguishable from 30 s. The bin
      speed average of 25.51 m/s is displayed below the speed axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lesson</b>. The two columns in Figure 2 are proportional
      to the <i>time weightings</i> given to the two bin speeds in
      Calculation (8). The bin speed average is a kind of "center
      of weight" for the two bin speeds that are contributing to
      the average. Note that the bin speed average is quite a bit
      closer to the bin speed with the larger time weighting. It is
      <b>not</b> in the middle between the two speeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same kinds of comments apply to Calculation (7) of the
      average speed or to the general Expression (3) for the
      average speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Why Bins and Bin Speeds?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We need to sort speeds into finite-sized bins in order to be
      able to define a time-weighted average of speed for
      continuously variable speed. If only discrete speeds are
      involved in a situation, as in the examples dealt with here,
      we can work with only these speeds and do not need bins.
      However, if the speed is varying continuously, i.e., not
      jumping by discrete amounts, sums like those in Equ.(3) need
      to be replaced by an integral. An integral is the limit of a
      calculation that uses bins and where one lets the bin size
      approach zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finite bins introduce an error. In Examples 2 and 3, the
      actual speed of 30.0 m/s is replaced by the bin speed of 29.0
      m/s. However, making the bins smaller will tend to make this
      kind of error smaller as well. The error vanishes in the
      limit of zero bin size.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Reset the applet. Display the Data box,
      and hide all graphs. Increase the number of bins to 50, and
      record the bin speeds for the bins containing the two speeds
      from Exercise 2, i.e., the speeds of 15.0 m/s and 30.0 m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should find that 30 m/s is now contained in Bin 29,
      covering the interval (29.1,30.2] m/s, and that the bin speed
      of 29.65 m/s is much closer to 30 m/s than the 29.0 m/s when
      only 25 bins are used. Unfortunately, the gain in accuracy at
      30 m/s is somewhat offset by a loss in accuracy at 15 m/s.
      With 25 bins, the bin speed of 15.0 m/s is identical to the
      actual speed. With 50 bins, Bin 12, covering the interval
      (14.1,15.2] m/s, has a bin speed of 14.53 m/s instead of 15.0
      m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeat the experiment from Exercise 2 with a 50-bin setting,
      calculate your bin speed average and compare it to that shown
      by the applet. You should find that, in spite of the loss of
      accuracy at 15 m/s due to binning, the bin speed average is a
      bit closer to the exact average speed because of the
      time-weightings involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, decreasing the bin size by a lot (the applet is
      not able to do that) is bound to decrease the error in
      binning because the bin speeds will necessarily be very close
      to the actual speeds. In the limit of vanishing bin size, the
      bin speed average will become identical with the exact
      average speed. For continuously varying speed, the only way
      of defining a time-weighted average is as a limit of bin
      speed averages. The following Exercise illustrates the use of
      bins when the speed is being varied continuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Reset the applet. Display both graphs,
      Speed vs. Time and Accumulated Time vs. Speed. Drag the
      graphs so that they don't overlap, but are fully contained
      within the window. Set the number of bins to 5. Play the
      motion, and vary the car's speed continually during the
      motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Describe your observations. The exact value of the average
      speed is displayed with the Speed vs. Time graph and the bin
      speed average with the Accumulated Time vs. Speed graph.
    </p>

      Repeat this with 50 bins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that it is possible when using wide bins to get a bin
      speed average that is quite close to the exact average speed.
      How does one have to choose the speeds to achieve that?
      However, it is also possible to get a bin speed average that
      is quite a bit different from the exact average speed. For
      narrow bins, the bin speed average always is close to the
      exact value of the average speed.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 6</b>. Suppose a motion involves three different
      speeds. Write down an expression for the average speed as
      time-weighted average of the three speeds analogous to
      Expression (3) for the time-weighted average of two speeds.
      Then give a derivation of your expression analogous to the
      derivation of Equ.(3).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>. If you need to calculate the value of the
      average speed, you cannot go wrong if you use the definition
      of average speed as distance traveled divided by time
      elapsed. Then why should one know about time-weighted
      averages and equations like Equ.(3) at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing how to calculate an average speed as a time-weighted
      average of speed provides a deeper understanding of the
      concept of average speed. Equ.(3) makes it clear what kind of
      an average is involved in calculating an average speed, while
      the ratio of distance traveled over time elapsed does not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the concept of time-weighted average of a quantity
      is a general concept that does not apply only to speed. E.g.,
      one is often interested in the average temperature over some
      time period, say, one month. This is a time-weighted average
      of temperature, and this average cannot be calculated as the
      ratio of the change in some quantity divided by the time
      elapsed. One has to use the basic definition of a
      time-weighted average to calculate average temperature, i.e.,
      to split the possible temperature range into equal-sized
      bins, measure the amount of time during which the value of
      the temperature was in each bin, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, using Equ.(3) can be easier than using the ratio
      distance traveled over time elapsed when calculating an
      average speed. The example in Question 1 of the previous
      section illustrates this. Compare Exercise 1 of the present
      section to Exercise 3 of the previous section.
