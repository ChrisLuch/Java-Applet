      The applet simulates that the average speed of an object
      during a time interval is the weighted average of the
      object's speeds in portions of that time interval.

      This page is designed to get you started using the applet.
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on
      this page are to be done in the applet. You may need to
      toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if your
      screen space is limited.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Press the Reset button <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset"
      align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Accumulated Time vs. Speed graph, by checking the
               appropriate check box <img src="WAAccumulatedTime.gif"
               alt="Accumulated Time" align="top">.  The Speed
               vs. Time graph and the Data box should not be
               displayed.  Drag the graph to the left portion of the
               window where it will not overlap with the motion of the
               car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set the Speed slider to 10 m/s, and set the motion direction to
      counter-clockwise by clicking the appropriate radio button.
      Keep the number of speed bins at 25.  Play <img src="Play.gif"
      alt="Play" align="top"> the motion at this speed until 20 s have
      accumulated.  Then Pause <img src="Pause.gif" alt="Pause"
      align="top"> it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the Speed slider to change the speed to 20 m/s, and
      reverse the direction of motion to clockwise.  Then Play the
      motion until the car is back where it started.  Pause the motion
      when the car is back at or near its starting point.  You may
      find it helpful to hide the car's image for this purpose by
      deselecting the Image button <img src="Image.gif" alt="Car
      Image" align="top">.  
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also want to hide the velocity vector by deselecting the
      Velocity button <img src="Velocity.gif" alt="Velocity Vector"
      align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
     You should obtain a graph of Accumulated Time vs. Speed like that
     shown in Figure 1 below.

      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark and light green coloring of the columns is used to
      visually distinguish between bins.  It has no other
      significance.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Continuing from Exercise 1, deselect the
     Accumulated Time vs. Speed check box to hide the graph, and
     display the Data box instead by selecting the Data button <img
     src="data.gif" align="top">.  If you made no other changes, the
     Data box should contain information like that in Figure 2 below.
     The accumulated times in the two bins will be slightly different
     in every case.

    <p>
      Note that the Accumulated Time is non-zero in Bins 4 and 9, the
      two bins containing the speeds 10 m/s and 20 m/s, respectively.
      Note that the Bin Speed Average of 12.37 m/s shown at the bottom
      of the Data box is also indicated in the Accumulated Time
      vs. Speed graph in the earlier Figure 1.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>Exercise 3</b>.  Continuing from Exercise 2, deselect the Data
     button to hide the Data box and check the Speed vs. Time check
     box <img src="WASpeed_Time.gif" align="top"> to display the Speed
     vs. Time graph.  If you made no other changes, the Speed vs. Time
     graph should look as in Figure 3 below.

      <b>Figure 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Compare the information the red graph of (instantaneous) speed
     vs. time can provide about the times accumulated while the motion
     was maintained at speeds of 10 m/s and 20 m/s to that in the
     earlier Figures 1 and 2.  Compare the exact value of 13.37 m/s of
     the average speed over the entire motion from the starting point
     back to (nearly) the starting point to the Bin Speed Average of
     12.37 m/s.

    <p>
     <b>Exercise 1</b>.  Reset the applet.  Arrange things so that
     only the Accumulated Time vs. Speed graph is displayed, apart
     from the car.  Play the motion and vary the speed throughout the
     motion without pausing the motion.  Observe the time accumulating
     in the different speed bins.  An example of the kind of graph you
     might obtain is shown in Figure 4 below.

    <p>
     Make the column for a given speed bin grow repeatedly at diffent
     times during the motion, by repeatedly setting the speed to a
     value within that bin.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Inspect the content of the Data box
     corresponding to Figure 4 and the Speed vs. Time graph for this
     motion.  Are the different displays consistent?
