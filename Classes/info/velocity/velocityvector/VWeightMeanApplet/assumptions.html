<div class="title">Assumptions - Average Speed As A Weigthed Average </div>

    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates that the average speed of an object during
      a time interval is the weighted average of the object's speeds
      in portions of that time interval.  
    </div>

    <p>
     This is a "theoretical" applet and therefore no physical
     assumptions are required.  
   </p>
   <p>
     The applet simulates the motion of an object (car) whose speed can be
varied with a slider and performs calculations based on the values of the speed
maintained by the object and the lenghts of the time intervals during which these
speeds are maintained.
