  Vector</a></div>

  <p>To draw a vector, select the Vector tool <img src="vector.gif"
  align="top">; then click in the applet window and draw with the
  mouse.  You can change the vector by dragging either its tail or its
  tip.  You can move the vector without changing it by clicking it
  somewhere near its middle and dragging it.

  <p>To draw a second vector, repeat the procedure, beginning with the
  selection of the Vector tool.  The applet will not allow you to draw
  more than two vectors.</li>

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="DottedLine"><img src="dottedline.gif" align="top"> Dotted Line</a></div>

  <p>When constructing the sum of two vectors via the parallelogram
  method, you will need to construct the parallelogram spanned by the
  two vectors.  The Dotted-Line tool lets you draw dotted lines for
  this purpose.  To draw a line, select the Dotted-Line tool <img
  src="dottedline.gif" align="top">; then click in the applet window
  and draw with the mouse.

  <p>You can change a dotted line by dragging either its tail or its
tip.  You can move the line without changing it by clicking it
somewhere near its middle and dragging it.

  <p>The Dotted-Line tool does not become active until two vectors
  have been drawn.</li>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif"

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="Resultant"><img src="resultant.gif"
  align="top"> Resultant</a></div>

  <p>The Resultant tool becomes active only after two vectors have
  been drawn.  This tool lets you draw a vector anywhere on the screen
  and works just like the Vector tool.  Use this tool to draw arrow
  representing the sum (resultant) of the two vectors drawn earlier,
  after either aligning them tip-to-tail or constructing the
  parallelogram spanned by the two vectors.  The resultant vector will
  be drawn in blue.

  <p>You can change your resultant by dragging either its tip or its
  tail end.  You can move the resultant without changing it by
  clicking near the middle of the arrow and dragging it.</li>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif"

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="Reset"><img src="reset.gif" align="top"> Reset</a></div>

  <p>Clears the applet window and gets the applet ready so that you
  can draw another pair of vectors.</li>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif"
border="0"></a></p>

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="Answer"><img src="answer.gif" align="top"> Answer</a></div>

  <p>The Answer button becomes active only after you have drawn a
  resultant.  When you click the Answer button, the applet will show
  the correct resultant in green.  For better comparison of the two
  resultants, your blue one and the green one provided by the applet,
  you can move either vector by clicking on it and dragging.</li>
