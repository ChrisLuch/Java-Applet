  <li><a name="Vector"><img src="vector.gif" align="top">
  Vector Tool</a></div>

  <p>To draw a vector, select the Vector tool <img src="vector.gif"
  align="top">; then click in the applet window and draw with the
  mouse.  You can change the vector by dragging either its tail or its
  tip.  You can move the vector without changing it by clicking it
  somewhere near its middle and dragging it.

  <p>To draw another vector, repeat the procedure, beginning with the
  selection of the Vector tool.</li>

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="DottedLine"><img src="dottedline.gif" align="top">
  Dotted Line Tool</a></div>

  <p>To draw a dotted line, select the Dotted-Line tool <img
  src="dottedline.gif" align="top">; then click in the applet window
  and draw with the mouse.

  <p>You can change a dotted line by dragging either its tail or its
tip.  You can move the line without changing it by clicking it
somewhere near its middle and dragging it.

  <p>The Dotted-Line tool does not become active until Page 3 when you
  are asked to draw the resultant of the three vectors.  The tool can
  help you in using the parallegram method.  In the example
  construction illustrated in the figure at the top, dotted lines are
  drawn to construct the intermediate resultant (in black) of vectors
  <img src="a.gif" align="top"> and <img src="b.gif"
  align="top">.</li>


<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif"

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="Delete"><img src="Delete.gif" align="top">
  Delete Tool</a></div>

  <p>You can delete any vector or dotted line that you have drawn by
  selecting the Delete tool <img src="Delete.gif" align="top"> and
  then clicking on the vector or dotted line.</li>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif"

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="IntermediateResultant">Intermediate Resultant</a></div>

  <p>On Page 3, you are asked to construct the resultant of the three
  vectors.  This will require constructing the resultant of two of the
  three vectors before adding the third vector.

  <p>In the example construction shown in the figure at the top, the
  resultant of vectors <img src="a.gif" align="top"> and <img
  src="b.gif" align="top"> is shown in black.  Use the Vector tool to
  draw this vector.  It will be drawn in blue at first.  Then, when
  you draw the overall resultant, by again using the Vector tool, the
  intermediate resultant will turn black and the true resultant will
  be in blue.

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif"
border="0"></a></p>

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="Resultant">Overall Resultant</a></div>

  <p>The correct resultant vector will be drawn automatically (in
  green) when you go to Page 4.  The program will let you advance to
  Page 4 only after you have drawn your resultant (in blue) on Page 3
  by means of the vector tool.

  <p>You can drag either the green or the blue resultant vectors by
  clicking on them somewhere near their midpoints and then dragging
  them.</li>
