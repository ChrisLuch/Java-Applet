<p>The applet illustrates the two basic properties of all vectors:
magnitude and direction.  It does that using a vector in two
dimensions.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the vector can be varied by dragging the vector at
its tip.  The magnitude is displayed at the bottom of the applet in
arbitrary units.</p>

<p>The direction of the vector is specified by the angle between the
vector and a horizontal reference line (shown dotted) pointing to the
right.  The angle is displayed at the bottom of the applet in degrees.
The direction can be varied by dragging the vector at its tip.</p>

<p>The vector can be moved without any change in magnitude or
direction by clicking near the middle of the vector and dragging the
vector.</p>

<p>Note that the number of angles needed to specify the direction of a
vector depends on the dimension of the space in which the vector is
defined.  In three dimensions, two angles are required.  In one
dimension, no angle is required, but one must specify in which of the
two possible directions along a given axis the vector is pointing.</p>
