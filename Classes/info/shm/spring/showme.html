      Observing the Motion of a Weighted Spring

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Reset <img src=
      "../springImages/Reset.gif" alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet. 
    </p>
	 <p>
		You will see something similar to Figure 1 below: a stretched
      spring with a weight attached to it. The weight will be at its
      equilibrium position. The spring constant will be set to
      <i>k</i> = 80 N/m, the mass of the suspended block (weight)
      to <i>m</i> = 1.25 kg (the spring is assumed to be massless),
      and the amplitude of the motion to <i>A</i> = 0.20 m.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="../springImages/WeightedSpring.gif" alt=
      "Weighted Spring">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three sliders to vary the spring constant <i>k</i>,
      the mass <i>m</i> of the suspended weight, and and the amplitude
      <i>A</i> of the oscillation. In the following Exercises 2 to 4
      you will be asked to examine the dependence of the system's
      period on these three variables.  The period is the time
      required for the motion to go through one full cycle, from the
      top to the bottom and back to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Data box, and PLAY the motion. Measure the period of
      the motion using the time <i>t</i> elapsed shown in the Data
      box.  PAUSE the motion after one or several cycles have been
      completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, REWIND the applet
      to set the system back to its initial position. Then change the
      spring constant from <i>k</i> = 80 N/m to <i>k</i> = 200 N/m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making the spring constant stiffer is indicated visually by a
      thickening of the spring and by a shortening of the spring. The
      applet is designed to keep the weight in the center of the
      applet window when the system is in equilibrium. Thus, as the
      spring gets stiffer (<i>k</i> increases), the point from which
      the spring is suspended moves down towards the fixed equilibrium
      point. The point of support is above the applet window and
      therefore invisible, but you will be able to see a downward
      movement of the turns of the spring as the spring gets stiffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the oscillatory motion for <i>k</i> = 200 N/m, and
      measure its period.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Comment</b>. The oscillation should be faster than before.
      To get better values for the period, measure the time elapsed
      during ten uninterrupted cycles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>.  Continuing from Exercise 2, REWIND the
      applet and change the mass of the suspended weight from <i>m</i>
      = 1.25 kg to <i>m</i> = 2.00 kg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Increasing the mass of the suspended weight is represented
      visually by an increase in the size of the suspended weight.
      Increasing the mass will also stretch the spring (the
      invisible point of suspension will move upward).
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the motion with <i>m</i> = 2.00 kg, and measure its
      period.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Comment</b>. The oscillation should be a bit slower than
      before. Again, to get better values for the period, measure
      the time elapsed during ten uninterrupted cycles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Continuing from Exercise 3, REWIND the applet
      and change the amplitude of the motion from <i>A</i> = 0.20 m to
      <i>A</i> = 0.30 m. Observe the motion and measure its period.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Comment</b>. You should be able to observe an oscillation
      with a larger amplitude than before, but unchanged period.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet, and display the green
      reference circle by pressing the Reference Circle button <img
      src="../springImages/ReferenceCircle.gif" alt="Reference Circle
      Button" align="top">.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		Move the mouse cursor
      onto the small grey circle (reference point), which initially
      is at the point marked "0, 2<font face="symbol">p</font>" on
      the green reference circle. When the cursor is over this
      point and changes into a pointing hand, drag the reference
      point to approximately the position shown in Figure 2 below.
      Notice how the length of the weighted spring is adjusted
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      By moving the reference point in this manner, you can
      set the starting point of the motion of the weighted
      spring. You can also drag the suspended weight up or down.
      However, this will vary the position of the reference point
      only throughout the right half of the reference circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The angle formed between the two grey lines in Figure 2 is
      called the <i>phase angle</i>. Its value at the start of the
      motion at <i>t</i> = 0 is denoted <font face=
      "symbol">d</font>. The angle <font face="symbol">d</font> is
      indicated in Figure 2. Its value at time <i>t</i> is denoted
      <font face="symbol">q</font>(<i>t</i>). Thus, <font face=
      "symbol">q</font>(0) = <font face="symbol">d</font>. The
      initial phase angle <font face="symbol">d</font> is also
      called the <i>phase</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The phase angle <font face="symbol">q</font>(<i>t</i>) at a
      general time <i>t</i> is illustrated in Figure 3 below.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, PLAY the motion
      and observe that the reference point on the reference circle is
      always on the same level as the oscillating weight.  PAUSE the
      motion and click the Projection toggle button <img

    </p>
	 <p>
		A blue horizontal line, illustrated in Figure 3, will connect
      the reference point to the center of the weight. Resume the
      motion, and observe the correspondence of the uniform circular
      motion of the reference point and the oscillatory motion of the
      weight as indicated by the connecting blue line.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Start the motion at
      <i>t</i> = 0 with a phase <font face="symbol">d</font> as in
      Figure 2, pause it at the point shown in Figure 3, and
      display the position vs. time graph, <i>y</i> vs. <i>t</i>.
      You will get a graph like that illustrated in Figure 4 below.
      <i>y</i> is the position of the center of the weight. The
      <i>y</i>-axis increases in the upward direction, with
      <i>y</i> = 0 at the equilibrium position.
    </p>
    <p>
      To display the graph, press the Graphs toggle button <img
      src="../springImages/Graphs.gif" alt="Graph Panel Button"
      align="top"> and select "Position" from the panel that opens
      up. For details on using the Graph panel, please see Point 6 in
      Help.

    <p align="center">
      <img src="../springImages/DisplTimeGraph.gif" alt=
      "y vs t graph">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 4</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that on the horizontal axis the time <i>t</i> is
      plotted in seconds (s). Don't be mislead by the unusual
      divisions labeled <font face="symbol">p</font>/4 and
      <font face="symbol">p</font>/2. These are in seconds, not in
      radians. Thus, the point where the <i>y</i> vs. <i>t</i>
      graph crosses the <i>t</i>-axis for the first time is at a
      time slightly before <i>t</i> = <font face=
      "symbol">p</font>/8 s. The reason for dividing the time axis
      in this way is that the expression for the period <i>T</i> of
      the oscillating spring is
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>T</i> = 2<font face="symbol">p</font><img src=
      "../springImages/root16.gif" alt="root symbol" align=
      "top">(<i>m</i>/<i>k</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of <font face="symbol">p</font> in this
      expression makes it natural to divide the time axis into
      segments that are multiples (or fractions) of <font face=
      "symbol">p</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also observe that the <i>y</i> vs. <i>t</i> graph in Figure 4
      does not start at <i>y</i> = 0 at <i>t</i> = 0. This is so
      because the phase <font face="symbol">d</font> is unequal to
      zero. Also notice that the maximum <i>y</i>-value is equal to
      the amplitude, <i>A</i> = 0.20 m. (This amplitude is the
      applet's default value. It is assumed that you do not change
      the amplitude before starting the motion.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, display the
      velocity vs. time graph, in addition to the position vs. time
      graph. Hide the reference circle to create more room, and
      arrange the two graphs as in Figure 5 below, with the graph
      of velocity vs. time on the left and the graph of position
      vs. time on the right. Move one graph at a time by selecting
      only that graph's movability checkbox in the Graph Panel.

    <p>
      Note that, since the graphs in Figure 5 have been moved,
      their time axes are no longer aligned with the weight's
      equilibrium position.

    <p>
      Erase the graphs, using the Reset button <img src=
      "../springImages/reset.gif" alt="Reset" align="top"> in the
      Graph panel (not the main Reset button), REWIND the applet, and
      PLAY the motion again to draw some fresh graphs.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, hide the
      velocity vs. time graph, and display the acceleration vs.
      time graph instead. Keep the position vs. time graph
      displayed. REWIND the applet. Then PLAY the motion, and observe
      the graphs as they are being drawn. Ignoring the difference
      in amplitude, the two graphs should differ from each other
      merely by an overall sign. When the position vs. time graph
      goes up, the acceleration vs. time graph goes down, and vice
      versa.

		Continuing from Exercise 1, hide the position vector and instead
      display the velocity vector both with its tail end attached at
