<div class="title">Assumptions - Energy Conservation In Simple Harmonic Motion (Pendulum)</div>

    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates the motion of a simple pendulum and energy
      conservation in this system.
    </div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p>The simple pendulum motion simulated by the applet is such that the
vertical projection of this motion onto a horizontal axis is exactly
simple harmonic motion.  The true motion of a simple pendulum is not
not quite like this, but for sufficiently small amplitudes, the
motion simulated by the applet is an excellent approximation (SHM approximation) to the
true motion.

<p>The following additional assumptions are made in creating the simulation.

<p><ul>

   <li>The pendulum string is massless.</li>

   <li>The pendulum bob behaves like a mass point.</li>

   <li>The system is frictionless.</li>

   <li>The potential energy of the pendulum is taken to be zero when
   the pendulum is at its equilibrium point, which is at the bottom of
   the pendulum's swing.</li>

   </ul>
