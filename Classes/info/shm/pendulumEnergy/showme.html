      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src= "../pendulumImages/Reset.gif"
      alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet.  
    </p>
	 <p>
		Set the amplitude to <i>A</i> = 0.52 m, and keep the mass,
      length, and magnitude of gravitational acceleration at their
      default values of <i>L</i> = 1.50 m, <i>m</i> = 0.50 kg, and
      <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>, respectively.  Display the Data
      box by selecting the Data toggle button <img
      src="../pendulumImages/Data.gif" alt="Data button" align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
    Start the motion from its default position, which has the pendulum
    bob in its most deflected position to the right, such that the
    phase <font face="symbol">d</font> is equal to 0. PLAY the motion,
    and PAUSE it at or near <i>t</i> = 1.64 s.  The pendulum, energy
    bar, and Data box should look as in Figure 1 below.
    </p>  
    <p align="center"> 
    <img src="../pendulumImages/PEEnergy.gif" alt= "Pendulum With
    Energy Bar and Data Box">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ratio of the kinetic energy portion (red) and potential
      energy portion (blue) of the energy bar should correspond to the
      ratio of these energies as displayed in the Data box.  In the
      case shown in Figure 1, this ratio has the value
      <i>KE</i>/<i>PE</i> = 0.34/0.11, which is close to 3/1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Continuing from Exercise 1, REWIND the
      applet.  The pendulum should be back in its right-most position.
      Drag the pendulum bob from the right to the left of its range of
      motion, and observe the variation in the potential energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should find that the potential energy goes from its maximum
      value when the pendulum is at the far right, to its minimum
      value when the pendulum is at its equilibrium position (bottom
      of the swing), back to its maximum value when the pendulum is at
      the far left.

      Graphs of Kinetic, Potential, and Mechanical Energy vs. Time
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Start the motion at
      <i>t</i> = 0 with the pendulum in its right-most (default)
      position.  Display both the position vs. time and potential
      energy vs. time graphs and arrange them as in Figure 2 below.
      Set the amplitude to <i>A</i> = 0.52 m and the pendulum length
      to <i>L</i> = 1.00 m, and keep the mass at <i>m</i> = 0.50 kg
      and the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity at <i>g</i>
      = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion until the oscillation has gone through one
      complete cycle and a little bit beyond, so that the pendulum has
      just started moving left again.  The two graphs should look
      similar to what is shown in Figure 2.  Ignore the position and
      velocity vectors for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
      To display the graphs, click on the Graphs toggle button <img
      src="../pendulumImages/Graphs.gif" alt="Graph Panel Button"
      align="top"> and check the appropriate checkboxes on the graph
      panel that opens up. For details on using the Graph panel,
      please see Point 4 in Help.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="../pendulumImages/PEPEGraph.gif" alt=
      "PE vs t graph">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>x</i> is the horizontal coordinate of the center of the pendulum bob. The
      <i>x</i>-axis increases to the right, with <i>x</i> = 0 at the
      pendulum bob's equilibrium position.  In the SHM approximation underlying
		the applet simulation, the potential energy
      <i>PE</i> is proportional to <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, specifically,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
     <i>PE</i> = (1/2)(<i>mg</i>/<i>L</i>)<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> .
    </p> 
    <p>
       Therefore, as <i>x</i> decreases, reaches 0, and decreases
       further to negative values, <i>PE</i> decreases, reaches 0, and
       increases again to positive values.  As a result, the frequency
       of oscillations of the potential energy <i>PE</i> is twice that
       of the frequency of the displacement <i>x</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that on the horizontal axis of the graphs the time
      <i>t</i> is plotted in seconds (s). Don't be mislead by the
      unusual divisions labeled &pi;/2,
      &pi;, etc. These are in seconds, not in
      radians. Thus, the point where the <i>x</i> vs. <i>t</i> graph
      crosses the <i>t</i>-axis for the first time is at a time
      close to <i>t</i> = &pi;/4
      s = 0.785 s. The reason for dividing the time axis in this way is that the
      expression for the period <i>T</i> of the oscillating spring is
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>T</i> = 2&pi;<img src=
      "../pendulumImages/root16.gif" alt="root symbol" align=
      "top">(<i>L</i>/<i>g</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of &pi; in this
      expression makes it natural to divide the time axis into
      segments that are multiples of &pi;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also observe that the maximum <i>x</i>-value in the <i>x</i>
      vs. <i>t</i> graph is equal to the amplitude, <i>A</i> = 0.52 m,
      and that the maximum value of <i>PE</i> is related to that of
      <i>A</i> according to the expression for <i>PE</i> given above,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
     <i>PE</i> = (1/2)<i>m(g</i>/<i>L</i>)<i>A</i><sup>2</sup> =
     (1/2)&times;0.50&times;9.8/1.00&times;0.52<sup>2</sup> = 0.66 J .
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, hide the position
      vs. time graph and display the kinetic energy vs. time graph
      instead, in addition to the potential energy vs. time graph.
      Arrange the graphs so that they don't overlap.  To do so, move
      one graph at a time by selecting only that graph's movability
      checkbox in the Graph Panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      REWIND the applet to put the pendulum bob back to its right-most
      position, and click Reset in the Graph panel (<b>not</b> the
      main Reset button) to clear the two graphs.  
    </p>
	 <p>
		PLAY the motion again through a little bit beyond one cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should again obtain the <i>PE</i> vs. <i>t</i> graph shown
      in Figure 2 above.  The <i>KE</i> vs. <i>t</i> should look like
      the "inverse" of the <i>PE</i> vs. <i>t</i> graph, i.e.,
      <i>KE</i> should be increasing when <i>PE</i> is decreasing and
      vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, display the
      position and velocity-at-origin vectors of the oscillating
      pendulum bob by checking the relevant checkboxes in the vector
      panel.  The vectors represented by cyan and magenta arrows,
      respectively.  These vectors are shown in Figure 2 above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential energy is proportional to the square of the length
      of the position vector and the kinetic energy is proportional to
      the square of the length of the velocity vector.
    </p>
    <p>
     Select the Zoom button <img src="../pendulumImages/Zoom.gif"
     alt="Zoom" align="top">.  The velocity vector and the two graphs
     should decrease by a factor 2 in length or height, respectively,
     and the energy bar by a factor of 4.  Then deselect the button
     again to restore the original heights.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>Exercise 4</b>.  Continuing from Exercise 3, REWIND the
     applet, and Reset the two graphs in the Graph panel.  Change the
     mass from <i>m</i> = 0.50 kg to <i>m</i> = 1.00 kg.  Ignore the
     fact that the energy bar will probably exceed the height of your
     applet window in this case.  PLAY the motion again through one
     cycle and a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
     You should be able to observe that the kinetic and potential
     energy graphs have doubled in height compared to those in
     Exercise 3, but that the velocity vector has the same amplitude
     as before.  
    </p>
    <p>
     The reason for the doubling of the amplitude of the <i>PE</i>
     graph is that <i>PE</i> is proportional to the mass, according to
     the equation quoted earlier.  Since the total mechanical energy
     <i>E</i> is equal to the potential energy at the start when
     <i>KE</i> = 0, the total energy is doubled as well when the mass
     is doubled.  And so is the kinetic energy, because <i>KE</i> =
     <i>E</i> - <i>PE</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
     If both <i>KE</i> and <i>m</i> are doubled, the speed must stay
     unchanged, in accordance with the equation
    </p>
    <p align="center">
     <i>KE</i> = (<i>m</i>/2)<i>v</i><sup>2</sup> .
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>Exercise 5</b>.  RESET the applet, and change the value of the
     amplitude from <i>A</i> = 0.17 m to <i>A</i> = 0.52 m.
     Display all three energy graphs, for potential, kinetic, and
     mechanical energy.  Keep all three graphs superimposed on each
     other in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
     PLAY the motion through one cycle and a bit.  You should obtain
     graphs like those in Figure 3 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="../pendulumImages/PEThreeEnergies.gif" alt=
      "Three Energy Graphs">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The three graphs may have to be moved a bit to not make them
      overlap with the energy bar.  To move them, check the movability
      icon for all three graphs in the Graph panel and then drag the
      graphs.  They will move together as one unit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Observe that the green graph for the mechanical energy <i>E</i>
     is a straight horizontal line at the tops of the <i>KE</i> and
     <i>PE</i> graphs.  Also observe that the graphs have gone through
     two cycles and a bit, while the motion itself has gone through
     one cycle and a bit.

     Dependence of the Potential Energy on System Parameters 
    </div>
    <p>
      The applet lets you vary the values of the following four
      parameters: amplitude <i>A</i>, pendulum length <i>L</i>,
      pendulum bob mass <i>m</i>, and magnitude <i>g</i> of the
      acceleration due to gravity. (In reality, you would have to go
      to the moon or to another planet to be able to study pendulum
      motion under conditions where <i>g</i> is not equal to 9.8
      m/s<sup>2</sup>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following Exercises you will be asked to examine the
      dependence of the maximum value of the potential energy on these
      four variables.  By "maximum value of the potential energy" the
      following is meant. The potential energy is a function of time
      during the pendulum's oscillation and takes on its maximum value
      both at the far right and far left positions of the pendulum
      bob.  The Exercises ask you to investigate if this maximum value
      depends on <i>A</i>, <i>L</i>, <i>m</i>, and <i>g</i>.  In this
      connection, remember the expression for the potential energy
      quoted above,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
     <i>PE</i> = (1/2)<i>m</i>(<i>g</i>/<i>L</i>)<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>.

      button <img src="../pendulumImages/Data.gif" alt="Data Button"
      align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make a drawing of the potential energy bar and record the value
      of the potential energy as given in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
     Change from <i>A</i> = 0.17 m to <i>A</i> = 0.52 m. Again, draw
      the potential energy column, next to the one already drawn, and
      record the value of the potential energy shown in the Data box.
      Are the results consistent with the equation for the potential
      energy above?  In comparing the data with the equation, keep in
      mind that there is the possibility of a significant amount of
      round-off error because so few significant digits of the
      potential energy are displayed in the Data box.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2 - Pendulum Length</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing from Exercise 1, change the length of the pendulum
      from <i>L</i> = 1.50 m to <i>L</i> = 3.00 m.  Draw the new
      potential energy bar next to the one already drawn, and record
      the value of the potential energy as shown in the Data box.

    <p>
      Continuing from Exercise 2, change the mass of the pendulum bob
      from <i>m</i> = 0.50 kg to <i>m</i> = 1.00 kg.  Draw the new
      potential energy bar next to the ones already drawn, and record
      the value of the potential energy as shown in the Data box.

      Are the changes in the height of the potential energy bar and in

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4 - Acceleration Due To Gravity</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing from Exercise 3, change the magnitude of the
      acceleration due to gravity from <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>
      to <i>g</i> = 5.0 m/s<sup>2</sup>.  Draw the new potential
      energy bar next to the ones already drawn, and record the value
