    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates both simple pendulum motion and uniform
      circular motion. At the small amplitudes used in the applet,
      the pendulum's motion is very nearly simple harmonic motion
      and visually indistinguishable from projected uniform
      circular motion.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. The pendulum will be at
      rest and deflected to the right with an amplitude <i>A</i> =
      0.17 m. The mass of the pendulum bob will be set to <i>m</i> =
      0.50 kg (the string is assumed to be massless), the length from
      the suspension point to the center of the bob to <i>L</i> = 1.50
      m, and the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity to
      <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.  There are four sliders that let
		let you vary the quantities <i>A</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>L</i>, and <i>g</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Data box by pressing the Data toggle button <img
      src="../pendulumImages/Data.gif" alt="Data button" align="top">,
      and PLAY the motion.
    </p>
	 <p>
		Measure the period of the motion by PAUSE-ing the motion after one
      cycle and taking the time elapsed <i>t</i> from the Data
      box.   The period is the time required for the
      pendulum bob to complete one full cycle, i.e., to move from
      the far right to the far left and back to the far right
      again.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		REWIND the applet. Then PLAY the motion once more and measure
		the period once more.  This time measure the time elapsed in
		several cycles and divide by the number of cycles to get the
		period.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Exercises 2 to 5, you will be
      asked to examine the dependence of the pendulum's period on
      the four variables <i>A</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>L</i>, and <i>g</i>.
		(In the real world, you
      would have to go to the moon or to another planet to be able
      to study pendulum motion under conditions of different <i>g</i>.) 
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2 - Amplitude</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing from Exercise 1, REWIND the applet and set the
      amplitude to <i>A</i> = 0.52 m. PLAY the motion, and
      measure its period. Compare the period to that found in
      Exercise 1 for <i>A</i> = 0.17 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Comment</b>. You should find that the period is independent
      of the amplitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3 - Mass</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing from Exercise 2, REWIND the applet and set the mass
      to <i>m</i> = 1.00 kg. PLAY the motion, and measure its
      period. Compare the period to that found in Exercises 1 and 2
      for <i>m</i> = 0.50 kg.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Comment</b>. You should find that the period is independent
      of the mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4 - Pendulum Length</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing from Exercise 3, REWIND the applet and set the length
      to <i>L</i> = 2.00 m. PLAY the motion, and measure its
      period. Compare the period to that found in Exercises 1 to 3 for
      <i>L</i> = 1.50 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Comment</b>. You should find that the period for <i>L</i> =
      2.00 m is slightly longer than for <i>L</i> = 1.50 m. To get
      better values for the period, measure the time elapsed during
      ten uninterrupted cycles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5 - Acceleration Due To Gravity</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing from Exercise 4, REWIND the applet and set the
      magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity to <i>g</i> =
      5.0 m/s<sup>2</sup>. PLAY the motion, and measure its
      period. Compare the period to that found in Exercise 4 for
      <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Comment</b>. You should find that the period for <i>g</i> =
      5.0 m/s<sup>2</sup> is slightly longer than for <i>g</i> =
      9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Again, to get a better measure of the
      period, time ten cycles rather than just one.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet, and display the green
      reference circle by selecting the Reference Circle toggle
      button <img src="../pendulumImages/ReferenceCircle.gif" alt=
      "Reference Circle Button" align="top">. 
    </p>
	 <p>
		Set the amplitude to <i>A</i> = 0.52 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the mouse cursor onto the small grey circle (reference
      point) on the green reference circle. Initially, the reference
      point is at the point marked "0, 2&pi;"
      on the green reference circle. When the cursor is over this
      point and has changed into a pointing hand, drag the reference
      point around the circle and observe how the pendulum's position
      changes accordingly. Alternatively, you can drag the pendulum
      bob, but this will allow you to move the reference point only in
      the upper half of the reference circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the reference point to approximately the position shown
      in Figure 1 below.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      By moving the reference point in this manner, you can
      set the starting point of the motion of the pendulum.
      The angle formed between the two grey lines in Figure 1 is
      called the <i>phase angle</i>. Its value at the start of the
      motion at <i>t</i> = 0 is denoted &delta; (Greek letter; read: delta).
		Its value at time <i>t</i> is denoted
      &theta;(<i>t</i>). Thus, &theta;(0) = &delta;. The
      initial phase angle &delta; is also called the <i>phase</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, PLAY the
      motion and observe that the reference point on the reference
      circle is always directly underneath the oscillating pendulum
      bob. PAUSE the motion, and press the Projection toggle
      button <img src="../pendulumImages/Projection.gif" alt=
      "Vertical Line" align="top">. 
	 </p>
	 <p> A blue vertical line will connect the reference point to the
      center of the pendulum bob as in Figure 2 below.  Ignore the
      acceleration vector (orange) in Figure 2 for the time being.

		Resume the motion, and observe the correspondence between the
		uniform circular motion of the reference point and the
		oscillatory motion of the pendulum bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      The projection of the pendulum bob's motion onto a horizontal
      axis (<i>x</i>-axis) is identical with the projection of the
      circular motion of the reference point onto this axis.

	 <p>	
		<u>Comment</u>.  The preceding statement
		is true exactly for the simulation provided by the applet.
		In reality, it is true only to a good approximation.  The
		approximation is the better the smaller the amplitude is.
		The approximation made when describing pendulum motion as projected
		circular motion is called the <i>simple-harmonic-motion (SHM) approximation</i>.
		Texbooks usually make this approximation when dealing with pendulum
		motions of small amplitudes, say, less than 10<sup>o</sup>.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Set the amplitude to
      <i>A</i> = 0.52 m, and set the phase &delta; to 1.00 rad. PLAY the motion, let it go
      through one complete cycle, and then PAUSE it at a point near

    </p>
    <p>
      Display the position vs. time graph, <i>x</i> vs. <i>t</i>.  The
      graph looks like that in Figure 3. <i>x</i> is the
      <i>x</i>-coordinate of the center of the pendulum bob, where the
      <i>x</i>-axis is horizontal with its origin at the equilibrium
      position of the pendulum (lowest point of the pendulum bob) and
      <i>x</i> increases to the right. The <i>x</i>-axis is
      illustrated in Figure 3, but the applet does not show the
      <i>x</i>-axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      To display the graph, click on the Graphs toggle button <img
      src="../pendulumImages/Graphs.gif" alt="Graphs Button"
      align="top"> and check "Position" in the graph panel that opens
      up. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that on the horizontal axis of the graph the time
      <i>t</i> is plotted in seconds (s). Don't be mislead by the
      unusual divisions labeled &pi;/2, &pi, etc. These are in seconds, not in
      radians. Thus, the point where the <i>y</i> vs.
         <i>t</i> graph has completed its first cycle is
         approximately at <i>t</i> = 0.8&pi; s = 2.51 s. The reason for
			dividing the time axis
         in this way is that the expression for the period <i>T</i>
         of the oscillating spring is
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>T</i> = 2&pi;<img src=
      "../springImages/root16.gif" alt="root symbol" align=
      "top">(<i>L</i>/<i>g</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of &pi; in this
      expression makes it natural to divide the time axis into
      segments that are multiples (or fractions) of &pi;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe also that the <i>x</i> vs. <i>t</i> graph in Figure 2
      does not start with the maximum value of <i>x</i> at <i>t</i>
      = 0. This is so because the phase &delta; is unequal to zero. Also notice that the
      maximum <i>x</i>-value is equal to the amplitude, <i>A</i> =
      0.52 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, display the
      velocity and acceleration vs. time graphs in addition to the
      position vs. time graph. Hide the reference circle so that
      there is enough room for all the graphs, and arrange the
      graphs as in Figure 4 below, from position vs. time on the
      left to acceleration vs. time on the right. In order to move
      the graphs, move one graph at a time by selecting only that
      graph's movability checkbox in the graph panel.
