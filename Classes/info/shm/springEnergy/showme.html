      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src=
      "../springImages/Reset.gif" alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet.  
    </p>
	 <p>
		Set the spring constant to <i>k</i> = 200 N/m, and keep the mass
      and the amplitude at their default values of <i>m</i> = 1.25 kg
      and <i>A</i> = 0.20 m, respectively.  Display the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
    Start the motion from its default position, which has the block
    in its top position, such that the phase has the value <font
    face="symbol">d</font> = <font face="symbol">p</font>/2 = 1.57
    rad. PLAY the motion, and PAUSE it at <i>t</i> = 0.70 s.  The
    spring, energy bar, and Data box should look as in Figure 1 below.
    </p>  
    <p align="center"> 
    <img src="../springImages/WSEEnergy.gif" alt= "Weighted Spring With
    Energy Bar and Data Box">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ratio of the kinetic energy portion (red) and potential
      energy portion (blue) of the energy bar should correspond to the
      ratio of these energies as displayed in the Data box.  In the
      case shown in Figure 1, this ratio has the value
      <i>KE</i>/<i>PE</i> = 1.03/2.97, which is close to 1/3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Continuing from Exercise 1, REWIND the applet.
      The block should be back in its top position.  Drag the block
      from the top to the bottom of its range of motion, and observe
      the variation in the potential energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should find that the potential energy goes from its maximum
      value when the block is at the top, to its minimum value when
      the weight is at the equilibrium point, back to its maximum
      value when the block is at its lowest point.
    </p>

      Graphs of Kinetic, Potential, and Mechanical Energy vs. Time
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Start the motion at
      <i>t</i> = 0 with the suspended block at its top position.
      Display both the position vs. time and potential energy vs. time
      graphs and arrange them as in Figure 2 below.  Set the spring
      constant to <i>k</i> = 200 N/m, the mass to <i>m</i> = 1.00 kg,
      and keep the amplitude at <i>A</i> = 0.20 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion until the oscillation has gone through one
      complete cycle and a little bit beyond, so that the block has
      just started moving down again.  The two graphs should look
      similar to what is shown in Figure 2.  Ignore the position and
      velocity vectors for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
      To display the graphs, press the Graphs toggle button <img
      src="../springImages/Graphs.gif" alt="Graph Panel Button"
      align="top"> and check the graphs in the panel that opens
      up. For details on using the Graph panel, please see Point 4 in
      Help.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="../springImages/WSEPEGraph.gif" alt=
      "PE vs t graph">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>y</i> is the position of the center of the block. The
      <i>y</i>-axis increases in the upward direction, with
      <i>y</i> = 0 at the equilibrium position.  The potential energy
      <i>PE</i> is proportional to <i>y</i><sup>2</sup>,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
     <i>PE</i> = (<i>k</i>/2)<i>y</i><sup>2</sup> .
    </p> 
    <p>
       Therefore, as <i>y</i> decreases, reaches 0, and decreases
       further to negative values, <i>PE</i> decreases, reaches 0, and
       increases again to positive values.  As a result, the frequency
       of oscillations of the potential energy <i>PE</i> is twice that
       of the frequency of the displacement <i>y</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that on the horizontal axis the time <i>t</i> is
      plotted in seconds (s). Don't be mislead by the unusual
      divisions labeled <font face="symbol">p</font>/2 and
      <font face="symbol">p</font>. These are in seconds, not in
      radians. Thus, the point where the <i>y</i> vs. <i>t</i>
      graph crosses the <i>t</i>-axis for the first time is at a
      time slightly before <i>t</i> = <font face=
      "symbol">p</font>/8 s. The reason for dividing the time axis
      in this way is that the expression for the period <i>T</i> of
      the oscillating spring is
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>T</i> = 2<font face="symbol">p</font><img src=
      "../springImages/root16.gif" alt="root symbol" align=
      "top">(<i>m</i>/<i>k</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of <font face="symbol">p</font> in this
      expression makes it natural to divide the time axis into
      segments that are multiples (or fractions) of <font face=
      "symbol">p</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also observe that the maximum <i>y</i>-value is equal to the
      amplitude, <i>A</i> = 0.20 m, and that the maximum value of
      <i>PE</i> is related to that of <i>A</i> according to the
      expression for <i>PE</i> given above,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
     <i>PE</i> = (<i>k</i>/2)<i>A</i><sup>2</sup> =
     (200/2)&times;0.20<sup>2</sup> = 4.0 J .
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, hide the position
      vs. time graph and display the kinetic energy vs. time graph
      instead, in addition to the potential energy vs. time graph.
      Arrange the graphs so that they don't overlap.  To do so, move
      one graph at a time by selecting only that graph's movability
      checkbox in the Graph Panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      REWIND the applet to put the block back to its top position, and
      click Reset in the Graph panel (<b>not</b> the main Reset
      button) to clear the two graphs.  Then PLAY the motion again
      through a little bit beyond one cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should again obtain the <i>PE</i> vs. <i>t</i> graph shown
      in Figure 2 above.  The <i>KE</i> vs. <i>t</i> should look like
      the "inverse" of the <i>PE</i> vs. <i>t</i> graph, i.e.,
      <i>KE</i> should be decreasing when <i>PE</i> is increasing and
      vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, check the
      "position" and "velocity at origin" checkboxes in the Graph
      Panel to display the position and velocity vectors of the
      oscillating block, in cyan and magenta, respectively.  These
      vectors are shown in Figure 2 above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential energy is proportional to the square of the length
      of the position vector and the kinetic energy is proportional to
      the square of the length of the velocity vector.
    </p>
    <p>
     Select the Zoom button <img src="../springImages/Zoom.gif"
     alt="Zoom" align="top">.  
    </p>
	 <p>
	  The velocity vector and the two graphs should decrease by a
     factor 2 in length or height, respectively.  Then deselect the
     button again to restore the original heights.
    </p>
    <p>
     The energy bar is programmed to not be affected by the Zoom button
     because its total length will not grow beyond the standard height
     of the applet window under the conditions available in the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>Exercise 4</b>.  Continuing from Exercise 3, REWIND the applet
     and Reset the two graphs in the Graph panel.  Change the mass
     from <i>m</i> = 1.00 kg to <i>m</i> = 0.50 kg.  PLAY the motion
     again through one cycle and a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
     You should be able to observe the same kinetic and potential
     energy graphs as in Exercise 3, but the velocity vector should
     have a larger amplitude than before.  Depending on your window
     size, you may have to use the Zoom button to keep the entire
     vector within the applet window at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
     The reason for the change in the magnitude of velocity without
     corresponding change in the kinetic energy is as follows.
     Changing the mass does not affect the potential energy.  Since
     the total mechanical energy <i>E</i> is equal to the potential
     energy at the start when <i>KE</i> = 0, the total energy is not
     affected by a mass change either.  Therefore, the kinetic energy
     cannot be affected since <i>KE</i> = <i>E</i> - <i>PE</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, if <i>KE</i> is not affected by a mass change, then the
     speed must be affected, in accordance with the equation
    </p>
    <p align="center">
     <i>KE</i> = (<i>m</i>/2)<i>v</i><sup>2</sup> .
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>Exercise 5</b>.  RESET the applet, and change the value of the
     spring constant from <i>k</i> = 80 N/m to <i>k</i> = 200 N/m.
     Display all three energy graphs, for potential, kinetic, and
     mechanical energy.  Keep all three graphs superimposed on each
     other in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
     PLAY the motion through one cycle and a bit.  You should obtain
     graphs like those in Figure 3 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="../springImages/WSEThreeEnergies.gif" alt=
      "Three Energy Graphs">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The three graphs may have to be moved a bit to not make them
      overlap with the energy bar.  To move them, check the movability
      icon for all three graphs in the Graph panel and then drag the
      graphs.  They will move together as one unit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Observe that the green graph for the energy <i>E</i> is a
     straight horizontal line at the tops of the <i>KE</i> and
     <i>PE</i> graphs.  Also observe that the graphs have gone through
     two cycles and a bit, while the motion itself has gone through
     one cycle and a bit.

     Dependence of the Potential Energy on System Parameters 
    </div>
    <p>
      The applet lets you vary the values of the spring constant
      <i>k</i>, the mass <i>m</i>, and the amplitude <i>A</i>. In the
      following Exercises you will be asked to examine the dependence
      of the potential energy on these three variables.  More
      precisely: the potential energy is a function of time during the
      weight's oscillation and takes on its maximum value both at the
      top and bottom positions of the block.  The Exercises are about
      this maximum value, whether it depends on <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>,
      and <i>A</i>.  In this connection, remember the expression for
      the potential energy quoted above,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
     <i>PE</i> = (<i>k</i>/2)<i>y</i><sup>2</sup> .
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1 - Spring Constant</b>
    </p>
	 <p>
      RESET the applet, display the Data box, and change the spring
      constant from <i>k</i> = 80 N/m to <i>k</i> = 50 N/m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make a drawing of the height of the potential energy bar, and
      record the value of the potential energy as given in the Data
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
     Change the spring constant to <i>k</i> = 200 N/m.  Again, draw the
    potential energy column, next to the one already drawn, and record
    the value of the potential energy shown in the Data box.  Are the
    results consistent with the equation above for the potential energy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that making the spring constant stiffer will be
      indicated visually by a thickening of the spring and by a
      shortening of the spring. The applet is designed to keep the
      block in the center of the applet window when the system is in
      equilibrium. Thus, as the spring gets stiffer (<i>k</i>
      increases), the point from which the spring is suspended moves
      down towards the fixed equilibrium point. The point of support
      is above the applet window and therefore invisible, but you will
      be able to see a downward movement of the turns of the spring as
      the spring gets stiffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2 - Mass</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing from Exercise 2, change the mass of the suspended
      block from <i>m</i> = 1.25 kg to <i>m</i> = 2.00 kg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Increasing the mass of the suspended block is represented
      visually by an increase in the size of the block.  Increasing
      the mass will also stretch the spring (the invisible point of
      suspension will move upward).
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there any change in the height of the potential energy bar or
      in the value of the potential energy shown in the Data box?  Are
      your observations consistent with the expression for the
      potential energy given above?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3 - Amplitude</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Change the amplitude from <i>A</i> = 0.20 m to <i>A</i> = 0.30
      m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Draw the height of the potential energy column next to the
      columns drawn earlier, and record the value of the potential
      energy shown in the Data box.  Are the changes you observe
      consistent with the expression for the potential energy given
      above?
