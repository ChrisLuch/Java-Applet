      The applet simulates the forces acting on a vertically moving
      block. The block is supported by springs that in turn are
      resting on a platform (Table). The table can move upward or
      downward.

    <p>
      This page is designed to get you started using the applet.
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on
      this page are to be done in the applet. You may need to
      toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if your
      screen space is limited.

      Setting the Block's Initial Position and Velocity
    </div>
    <p>
      The applet lets you investigate the forces acting on a
      vertically moving block. The block is resting on springs that
      in turn are resting on a table. The table can move vertically
      with constant velocity or constant acceleration. This system
      is analogous to a person (block) standing on a bathroom scale
      (springs) resting on the floor of an elevator (table).
    </p>
    <p>
      Reset <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset" align="top"> the
      applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the system consisting of table, springs, and block
      downward, so that the table is just above the control panel,
      by clicking on any part of the system and dragging. This way
      there will be a maximal amount of room for the motion to
      follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set the initial velocity to -10.0 m/s by means of the
      Velocity slider: <img src="BlockSpringsVelSlider.gif" alt=
      "Velocity Slider" align="top">
    </p>
    <p>
      The system's velocity can be only upward or downward, i.e.,
      only in the positive or negative <i>y</i>-direction. Notice
      the direction of the <i>y</i>-axis displayed near the right
      edge of the applet window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quantity set with the Velocity slider is the system's
      <i>y</i>-component of velocity, <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>. Let us
      refer to it as "velocity", for short.
    </p>
    <p>
      All parts of the system, table, springs, and block, move in
      unison with the same velocity at any given instant. The
      applet does not simulate the initial oscillations that take
      place when there is a change in acceleration.

      Setting the Block's Acceleration
    </div>
    <p>
      Continuing from the previous section, set the block's
      acceleration to 2.00 m/s<sup>2</sup> by means of the
      Acceleration slider: <img src="BlockSpringsAccSlider.gif"
         alt="Acceleration Slider" align="top">
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how the orange acceleration vector responds to this
      setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quantity set with the Acceleration slider is the system's
      <i>y</i>-component of acceleration <i>a<sub>y</sub></i>. Let
      us refer to it as "acceleration", for short.
    </p>
    <p>
      When done, the applet display should look like the
      illustration in Figure 1 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="BlockSpringsInitial.gif" alt=
      "Initial Configuration">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice the Speedometer. The red needle is at 10 m/s, which is
      the speed corresponding to <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> = -10.0 m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vary the acceleration by dragging the tip of the orange
      acceleration vector, and observe how the normal force
      <i>N</i> in the free-body diagram on the left and the
      compression of the springs change. The block's weight
      <i>W</i> does not change.
    </p>
    <p>
      When done with these observations, set the acceleration back
      to 2.00 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
    </p>

      <a name="Motion">Observing the Motion</a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Continuing from the previous section, PLAY <img src=
      "Play.gif" alt="Play" align="top"> the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that the motion is downward at first, corresponding to
      the negative initial velocity of -10.0 m/s, but that it slows
      down, comes to a stop, and then changes into an upward
      motion. Observe how, at all times, the tab of the Velocity
      slider is moving to the right at a constant rate and how the
      values displayed by the slider are constantly increasing
      starting at -10.0 m/s. This is consistent with the positive and
      constant value of the acceleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      REWIND <img src="Rewind.gif" alt="Rewind" align="top"> the
      applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion again, and observe the speedometer needle.  The
      speed decreases at first from 10 m/s to 0. Then it starts
      increasing again, when the motion has reversed direction. The
      motion is halted when the speed reaches 20 m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also observe that there are no changes in the forces during
      the motion as the velocity and position of the system are
      changing, as long as the acceleration stays the same.
    </p>

    <div class="sectionheading">
      <a name="Frame">Changing the Frame of Reference</a>
    </div>
    <p>
      In the previous sections, the applet has been in the Lab
      Frame mode by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet lets you view things from two frames of reference:
      the Lab frame and the Object frame. The Lab frame is the
      frame in which the laboratory is at rest. This is assumed to
      be an inertial frame, at least to a good approximation. The
      Object frame is the frame in which the "object", i.e., the
      block, springs, and table are at rest. This is a non-inertial
      frame if the block-springs-table system is accelerating
      relative to the Lab frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rewind the applet, and select the Object frame by clicking
      the respective radio button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the change in the free-body diagram, displayed in
      Figure 2 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="BlockSpringsNonInertial.gif" alt="Noninertial FBD">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The free-body diagram now contains a third vector, shown in
      black. This vector is the fictitious force acting on the
      block in the non-inertial frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also note that the acceleration vector is now labeled <img
      src="A_capital.gif" alt="vector A" align="bottom">, not <img
      src= "a.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom"> as when viewing
      things from the Lab frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vector <img src="A_capital.gif" alt="vector A" align=
      "bottom"> represented by the orange arrow whose
      <i>y</i>-component is shown by the slider is the acceleration
      of the Object frame relative to the Lab frame. The block's
      acceleration <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom">'
      relative to the Object frame is zero and does not need to be
      illustrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion. You will see the table-springs-block system
      remain at rest while the background is moving, first upward,
      then downward. The background is fixed relative to the Lab
      frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motion of the background that you can see in the Object
      frame looks like the reverse of the system's motion when viewed
      from the Lab frame. In the Object-Frame mode, the velocity shown
      by the slider is the velocity of the Object frame relative to
      the Lab frame. The system's velocity relative to the Object
      frame is zero at all times.
