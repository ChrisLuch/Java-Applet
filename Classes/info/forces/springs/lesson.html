    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates the forces acting on a vertically moving
      block. The block is supported by springs that in turn are
      resting on a platform (Table). The table can move upward or
      downward.

      <b>Prerequisites</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should be familiar with the concepts of acceleration
      and force, and the way they are connected through Newton's
      second law of motion. Students should know about the
      gravitational force and the concept of weight and should know
      Newton's third law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Learning Outcomes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students will learn about the normal force and how to use
      Newton's second law to calculate the normal force acting on a
      vertically accelerating object. They will deepen their
      understanding of both Newton's second and third laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should know how the applet functions, as described
      in Help and ShowMe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in
      the following text are to be done in the applet. You may need
      to toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if
      your screen space is limited.

    <p>
      <u>Comment 1</u>. If the forces on the left-hand side of this
      equation are all <b>real</b> forces, then this equation is
      true only in an inertial frame, any inertial frame. In this
      Lesson, we will use the Laboratory Frame throughout which the
      applet takes to be an inertial frame. <i>Real forces</i> are
      forces resulting from the interaction between two objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 2</u>. "Particle" means a "point particle" of
      negligible extension. This law also applies to an extended
      object if the object is rigid and not rotating. Then all
      parts of the object have the same acceleration, and Equation
      (1) is true with this acceleration. It does not matter
      <b>where</b> the forces are acting on the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 3</u>. The sum of all forces acting on a particle
      or extended object is referred to as the <i>net force</i> or
      the <i>total force</i> acting on the particle or object. The
      net force is the <b>vector</b> sum of the individual forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Newton's Third Law</b>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      If an object A exerts a force <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
                  align="bottom"> on another object B, then object
                  B exerts a force on object A equal to -<img src=
                  "F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom">.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 1</u>. Forces are the result of interactions
      between <b>pairs</b> of objects. The interaction between a
      pair of objects always gives rise to <b>two</b> forces that
      are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. One of
      these forces acts on one of the objects, the other force acts
      on the other object. In Newton's words, as translated by I.B.
      Cohen and A. Whitman "If anyone presses a stone with a
      finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone."
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 2</u>. Newton's third law is sometimes summarized
      by the glib phrase "action is equal to reaction". If it is
      not carefully explained what this statement means, it can be
      interpreted in all kinds of ways, most of which different
      from what is intended in Newton's third law. Nevertheless,
      for brevity's sake, in this Lesson the term <i>reaction
      force</i> will be used to refer to the Newton's-third-law
      partner of a given force.

      RESET the applet. The acceleration and velocity should be
      zero. PLAY the motion. Nothing should happen. The
      table-springs-block system remains at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. Look at the free-body diagram for the
      block, shown in Figure 1 below. It shows an upward force of
      magnitude <i>N</i> = 19.6 N and a downward force of equal
      magnitude <i>W</i> = 19.6 N acting on the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are these two forces?
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="BlockSpringsRest.gif" alt="System at Rest">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's first of all make sure the free-body diagram in Figure
      1 shows <b>all</b> forces acting on the block. In doing so,
      let's assume we can ignore the forces exerted on the block by
      the surrounding air. (They are by no means small, but very
      nearly cancel. The sum of these forces amounts to a force of
      buoyancy that is small compared to the block's weight and a
      small force of air resistance when the block is in motion.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Other than the forces due to the air, there is first of all
      the gravitational force <img src="W_capital.gif" alt=
      "vector W" align="bottom"> exerted on the block by the earth.
      Every massive object has such a force acting on it. In
      addition, there are the contact forces exerted by all objects
      that are in contact with the block. The air is in contact
      with the block and does exert forces on the block. However,
      we have agreed to ignore these. The only other objects in
      contact with the block are the springs that the block is
      resting on. The total force exerted by the springs on the
      block is called the <i>normal force</i> because it is
      perpendicular to the block's bottom surface with which the
      springs are in contact. Let's denote this force by
         <img src="N_capital.gif" alt="vector N" align="bottom">.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 1</u>. The direction perpendicular to a surface is
      called the "normal" direction in mathematics, and this is why
      the force exerted on the block by the springs is called the
      normal force. Forces exerted by lots of other objects besides
      springs are called "normal forces" as long as they happen to
      be perpendicular to a surface. The term "normal force" does
      not refer to a special type of interaction between objects,
      but merely to the direction of a force.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 2</u>. The total normal force <img src=
      "N_capital.gif" alt="vector N" align="bottom"> exerted on the
      block is the sum of the normal forces <img src=
      "N_capital.gif" alt="vector N" align="bottom"><sub>1</sub>,
      <img src="N_capital.gif" alt="vector N" align=

    <p>
      These individual normal forces are illustrated in Figure 2
      below. (They are not shown by the applet. The block is shown
      in grey here to make it easier to see the force vectors.)
    </p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, the gravitational force is not a single force
      either, but a sum over the gravitational forces acting on all
      the atoms of the block. There are many more such individual
      gravitational forces acting on the block than there are
      normal forces acting on the block. The total gravitational
      force is a <i>volume force</i>, because it is distributed
      throughout the volume of the block, while the normal force is
      a <i>surface</i> force.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 3</u>. In finding the forces exerted on the block,
      we have divided all forces that are possible into two types:
      contact forces and long-range forces. For a contact force to
      exist, there must be another object in <b>contact</b> with
      the block. Long-range forces do not require direct contact.
      There are three kinds of long-range forces that can be
      observed in macroscopic (as opposed to sub-atomic) phenomena:
      gravitational, electric, and magnetic forces. The
      gravitational force exerted by the earth on any massive
      object near the surface of the earth is always present, as in
      the case of the block. However, the block does not have any
      electric or magnetic forces acting on it because it is not
      electrically charged and has no magnetic properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. Why do the normal and gravitational forces
      acting on the block have the same magnitude when the block is
      not accelerating? Base your answer on Newton's laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. First let's note that Newton's <b>third</b>
      law has nothing to do with the explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be tempting to think that it does because the law
      talks about two forces that are opposite in direction and
      equal in magnitude, which is what we have here. However, the
      two forces in Newton's third law act on <b>different</b>
      bodies while the two forces that we are considering here act
      on the <b>same</b> body, namely, the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is Newton's <b>second</b> law that provides the
      explanation. This law deals with forces that are acting on
      one and the same body. Let's apply this law to the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we are confident that we know what all the forces
      are, we can write down the Newton's-second-law equation (1)
      for the block,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="W_capital.gif" alt="vector W" align="bottom"> + <img src=
      "N_capital.gif" alt="vector N" align="bottom"> = <i>m</i>
      <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom"> .
         <img src="small.gif" alt="space" width="40" height="1">
         (3)
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the block's acceleration is zero, the right-hand side
      of equation (3) vanishes which implies
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="N_capital.gif" alt="vector N" align="bottom"> = -
      <img src="W_capital.gif" alt="vector W" align="bottom"> .
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" width="40" height="1"> (4)
    </p>
    <p>
      In words, the normal force is opposite to the gravitational
      force and has the same magnitude as the gravitational force.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Additional Observation</u>. The earlier Eq.(2), and a
      similar one for the gravitational forces acting on the parts
      of the block, also is evidence that the normal force is not
      related to the gravitional force by Newton's third law. The
      individual normal forces acting on the molecules in the
      bottom surface of the block cannot be paired individually
      with the gravitational forces acting on the molecules
      throughout the volume of the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 3</b>. Suppose a book is at rest on a table, as
      illustrated in Figure 3 below. This time there are no springs
      supporting the book. The book is directly in contact with the
      table. Is there still a normal force acting on the book and,
      if so, what object is exerting this normal force?
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="NewtonIIIBook.jpg" alt="Book on Table">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Since the book has zero acceleration, Newton's
      second law applied to the book still requires the net force on
      the book to be zero. This means that in addition to the downward
      gravitational force <img src="W_capital.gif" alt="vector W"
      align="bottom"> there must again be an upward force whose
      magnitude is equal to <i>W</i> be acting on the book. This is
      again a normal force, because the force must be vertical and
      therefore at right angles to the bottom surface of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      This upward normal force <img src="N_capital.gif" alt="vector N"
      align= "bottom"> is exerted by the table on the book. There is
      no other object in contact with the book that could be exerting
      this normal force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Question: How can a table be exerting an upward force on a
      book? Answer: Quite similarly to the way in which the springs
      in the applet can exert an upward force on the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      A table may appear quite rigid, but in fact it is not totally
      rigid and behaves like a rather stiff spring. Placing a book
      on a table will cause a slight compression of the table in
      proportion to the weight of the book. The same kind of force
      that causes a compressed spring to push back against the
      object also causes a table to push back against a book lying
      on the table.

      <a name="Measuring">Measuring The Normal Force</a>
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. How could one measure the magnitude
      <i>N</i> of the normal force exerted by the springs on the
      block?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. REWIND the applet. Vary the acceleration, and
      observe the magnitude of the normal force and the amount of
      compression of the springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that as the normal force increases in magnitude the
      springs get more compressed. Does this not suggest a way of
      measuring <i>N</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there a theoretical reason why the compression of the
      springs should be a measure of <i>N</i>, <b>not</b> <i>W</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there is. Let's go through the argument. First of all,
      what are the reaction forces (in the Newton's-third-law
      sense) to the normal forces <img src="N_capital.gif" alt=
      "vector N" align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> to <img src=
      "N_capital.gif" alt="vector N" align="bottom"><sub>3</sub>
      and to the total normal force <img src="N_capital.gif"
         alt="vector N" align="bottom">?
    </p>
    <p>
      Normal force <img src="N_capital.gif" alt="vector N" align=
      "bottom"><sub>1</sub> is exerted by the left spring on the block
      (the part of the block in contact with the spring). The reaction
      force to this force is the force -<img src= "N_capital.gif"
      alt="vector N" align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> exerted by the block
      on the left spring. Notice how the words "left spring" and
      "block" in the first sentence for the force simply need to be
      interchanged in the second sentence to get the reaction
      force. This reaction force, and the reaction forces to the other
      two spring forces exerted on the block are illustrated in Figure
      4 below by red arrows. (These reaction forces are not shown by
      the applet.)
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="BlockonSpringsreaction.jpg">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 4</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The reaction force to the total normal force <img src=
      "N_capital.gif" alt="vector N" align="bottom"> is the sum of the
      three reaction forces illustrated in red in Figure 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the total force pushing down on the springs is the
      reaction force to the normal force <img src="N_capital.gif"
      alt="vector N" align="bottom"> and therefore has magnitude
      <i>N</i>, not
      <i>W</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figure 4 illustrates the case when the acceleration is zero
      and <i>N</i> = <i>W</i>. Thus the force pressing down on the
      springs will have magnitude <i>W</i> in this case. However,
      when the acceleration of the block is not zero (see next
      section), <i>N</i> is <b>unequal</b> to <i>W</i>. In this
      case the force pushing down on the springs will have
      magnitude <i>N</i>, not <i>W</i>, with <i>N</i> <b>not</b>
      equal to <i>W</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The compression of the springs is a measure of the magnitude
      of the force applied to the springs. Thus, by calibrating the
      springs one can measure <i>N</i> by measuring the compression
      of the springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strain gauges work according to this principle even though
      they do not use springs to sense deformation but wires whose
      electrical resistance changes upon deformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. What is the magnitude and direction of the
      total force exerted on the springs by the table? In general,
      when the system table-springs-block is accelerating, is this
      force equal to <img src="N_capital.gif" alt="vector N"
      align="bottom"> or -<img src="W_capital.gif" alt="vector W"
      align="bottom">? Which one of Newton's laws, the second one or
      the third one, determines the answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Hint</u>. Apply Newton's second law to the springs, and
      assume the mass of the springs to be negligible.

    <p>
      <b>Question</b>. What is the magnitude <i>N</i> of the normal
      force acting on the block when the system table-springs-block
      is accelerating upward with an acceleration of magnitude 2.00
      m/<sup>2</sup>? The block's mass is 2.00 kg. Use <i>g</i> =
      9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> for the magnitude of the acceleration due
      to gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Use the applet to find the answer. The answer,
      <i>N</i> = 23.6 N, is shown in Figure 5 below.

    </p>
	 <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 5</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      How would one calculate the value of <i>N</i>? Again, we
      apply Newton's second law to the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need to know what forces are acting on the block. Compared
      to the situation considered in the earlier section "What Is A
      Normal Force?", <b>nothing</b> has changed in the kinds of
      forces that are acting on the block just because the block is
      accelerating! The same two kinds of forces as earlier, shown
      again in the free-body diagram in Figure 5, are acting on the
      block.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing that is different is that when the
      acceleration is not zero the two forces have different
      magnitudes. The upward-directed force, the normal force, must
      have the greater magnitude. Reason: the acceleration is
      upward and therefore, by Newton's second law, the net force
      must be upward also. Thus, the upward normal force must have
      greater magnitude than the downward gravitational force.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, the fact that <i>N</i> is unequal to <i>W</i> in
      this case is again evidence that the normal force and the
      gravitational force are not an action-reaction force pair.
      The two forces in an action-reaction force pair always have
      the same magnitude, even when the interacting objects are
      accelerating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the block is moving in the <i>y</i>-direction, we need
      to write down the <i>y</i>-component of the
      Newton's-second-law equation (1) for the block,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>N<sub>y</sub></i> + <i>W<sub>y</sub></i> = <i>m
      a<sub>y</sub></i>. <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
         height="1" width="40"> (5)
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the normal force is in the positive <i>y</i>-direction,
      <i>N<sub>y</sub></i> = <i>N</i>. Similarly, since the
      acceleration is in the positive <i>y</i>-direction,
      <i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = <i>a</i>. However, the gravitational
      force is in the negative <i>y</i>-direction, and therefore
      <i>W<sub>y</sub></i> = -<i>W</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making these substitutions in Equation (5) leads to

      <i>N</i> - <i>W</i> = <i>m a</i>. <img src="small.gif"

    </p>
    <p>
      The weight <i>W</i> is equal to <i>mg</i>. Substituting this
      expression into Equation (6) and solving the resulting
      equation for <i>N</i> gives
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>N</i> = <i>mg</i> + <i>ma</i> = <i>m</i>(<i>g</i> +

    <p>
      Substituting the given values gives

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Calculate the magnitude of the normal
      force when the acceleration is downward and has magnitude
      2.00 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Check your result with the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. A person is standing on a bathroom scale
      in an elevator that is accelerating upward. What is the
      reading on the scale if the person's mass is 60 kg and the
      magnitude of the acceleration is 1.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. A person is standing on a bathroom scale
      in an elevator that is slowing down while moving downward.
      The elevator is losing speed at a rate of 1.5
      m/s<sup>2</sup>. What is the reading on the scale if the
      person's mass is 60 kg?
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Hint</u>. The so-called 'weight' shown by the bathroom
      scale is really the normal force exerted by the scale on the
      person standing on the scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is so because the pointer on the scale indicates the
      compression of the springs inside the scale, and this
      compression is proportional to the magnitude of the force
      exerted on the springs at the top and bottom of the springs,
      which in turn is equal to the magnitude of the normal force
      exerted by the scale on the person. See the discussion in the
      preceding section "Measuring The Normal Force".
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that bathroom scales are not calibrated in newton, even
      though they measure forces, but in kilogram (or sometimes in
      lb, but let's assume kg here). The mass value shown by a
      bathroom scale is the mass whose corresponding weight is
      equal to the force pressing down on the scale. Thus, if a
      600-N force is pressing down on the scale, the scale will
      read 600/9.8 = 61.2 kg.
