      Help - Block on Springs

    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates the forces acting on a vertically moving
      block. The block is supported by springs that in turn are
      resting on a platform (Table). The table can move upward or
      downward.

            a Lab Frame view in which the background remains at

          The Lab Frame is an inertial frame, the Object Frame a

        </p>
        <p>
          In the non-inertial Object Frame, there is a fictitious
          force in addition to the two real forces (normal and
          gravitational) that exist equally in both frames. This
          fictitious force is displayed as a black vector in the
          free-body diagram when the Object Frame mode is
          selected. Also, when in this mode, the acceleration vector
          displayed by the applet is not the acceleration of the block
          in this frame, which is zero, but the acceleration <img

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>Acceleration</u>: <i>y</i>-component of acceleration of

            m/s<sup>2</sup> to 4.00 m/s<sup>2</sup> in steps of 0.01
            m/s<sup>2</sup>.
         </li>
			<li> 
           <u>Velocity</u>: <i>y</i>-component of velocity of the
           block-springs-table system in the range from -20.0 m/s to
           20.0 m/s in steps of 0.1 m/s.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Clicking on a slider to the left or right of the slider
          tab allows fine adjustment of the slider setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clicking on the Input Dialog button <img src=
          "SliderButton.gif" alt="Input Dialog Button" align="top"> of
          a slider opens a dialog for entering an exact value for the
          slider setting. The dialog for the Acceleration slider is
          illustrated below. The range in which values can be entered,
          from -4.00 m/s<sup>2</sup> to 4.00 m/s<sup>2</sup> in this
          case, is indicated above the data entry field.

        </p>
		  <p>
          The Acceleration slider remains active during the motion and
            can be used to change the acceleration while the motion is
            in progress. While the slider is not being adjusted, the
            acceleration is constant.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the applet is in the Lab Frame mode, the acceleration set
          by the slider is the (<i>y</i>-component of the)
          acceleration <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom">
          of the system (table-springs-block) relative to the Lab
          frame. If the applet is in the Object Frame mode, the
          acceleration set by the slider is the (<i>y</i>-component of
          the) acceleration <img src="A_capital.gif" alt="vector A"
          align="bottom"> of the Object Frame relative to the Lab
          Frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Velocity slider can be used to set the
          (<i>y</i>-component of the) initial velocity of the system
          relative to the Lab frame.  The slider is inactive during
          the motion so that its setting cannot be changed during the
          motion or when the motion is paused.  Nevertheless, it
          displays the instantaneous velocity of the system relative
          to the Lab frame at all times.  It does this both in the Lab
          Frame or Object Frame modes.
        </p>
		  <p>
          <u>Comment</u>. Since the system is always at rest relative
          to the Object frame, by definition of the Object frame, the
          velocity of the system relative to the Lab frame is equal to
          the velocity of the Object frame relative to the Lab frame.

          The red needle displays the system's speed relative to
          the Lab Frame, or the speed of the Object Frame relative
          to the Lab frame, depending on which frame is selected.
        </p>
		  <p>
          <u>Comment</u>. The values shown by the speedometer are
          always positive or zero, because of the definition of speed.
          In constrast, both positive and negative values are shown by
          the Velocity slider because the <i>y</i>-component of the
          velocity can be either positive or negative.

          The acceleration vector set by the Acceleration slider is
          represented by an orange arrow near the right edge of the
          applet window.  The vector is labeled <img src="a.gif"
          alt="vector a" align="bottom"> or <img src="A_capital.gif"
          alt="vector A" align="bottom"> depending on whether the
          applet is in the Lab Frame or Object Frame mode,
          respectively.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          When the acceleration is zero, the acceleration is
          represented by an orange dot, labeled <img src="a.gif"
          alt="vector a" align="bottom"> = 0 or <img
          src="A_capital.gif" alt="vector A" align="bottom"> = 0,
          depending on the mode.
		  </p>
          The mouse cursor changes from a pointing arrow to a pointing
          hand when placed over the tip of the acceleration vector.
          At this time, you can change the acceleration by clicking
          and dragging the tip of the vector.  Dragging the vector
          provides an alternate means of setting the acceleration.
          (See Point 3 above for setting the acceleration by means of
          a slider.) The acceleration vector can be adjusted during
          the motion, either by dragging the arrow or by adjusting the
          acceleration slider.

          In the Lab Frame mode, the free-body diagram for the block
          (left image) shows the two (real) forces acting on the
          <b>block</b>: the gravitational force of magnitude
          <i>W</i> exerted by the earth on the block and the normal
          force of magnitude <i>N</i> exerted by the springs on the
          block. The gravitational force stays the same no matter
          how the system is adjusted, but the normal force depends
          on the block's acceleration, but not on its velocity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Object Frame mode, the free-body diagram (middle
          image) shows the fictitious force (in black) that exists
          only in this non-inertial frame, in addition to the same two
          real forces as in the Lab Frame. The vector sum of these
          three forces, including the fictitious force, is equal to
          zero, because the system's acceleration <img src="a.gif"
          alt="vector a" align="bottom">' relative to the Object Frame
          is equal to zero.
