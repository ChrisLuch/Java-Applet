      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src= "Reset.gif" alt="Reset"
      align="top"> the applet. The applet should be in the Force mode.
    </p>
	 <p>
      From the three Force drop-down menus, select the words "normal",
      "box", and "table" as illustrated in Figure 1 below.  Then
      SUBMIT your selection.
	 </p>
	 <p align="center">

	 <br><br>
      <b>Figure 1</b>
	 </p>
    <p>
      You have selected the normal force exerted by the box on the
      table.  The applet responds by selecting the corresponding
      vector in the free-body diagram for the table and by adding the
      vector to the image of the box-table-earth system with the tail
      end of the vector at the point where the force is acting. See
      Figure 2 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="VerbalVectors.gif" alt="(normal, box, table) vector">
    <br><br>
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
	 <p>
		The applet renders all normal force vectors in blue.  The
		example in Figure 2 illustrates this.
    </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Choose another force by selecting another
      vector in one of the three free-body diagrams.  To select the
      vector, click on it.  The selected vector is shown in solid black.  
    </p>
	 <p>
		Try to think of the verbal description of the force you have
      selected and where in the image of the box-table-earth system
      the force vector should be drawn.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      SUBMIT your selection.  The applet responds by indicating the
      verbal description of the force via the Force drop-down menus,
      rendering the force vector in the free-body diagram in the
      appropriate color (see Help, Point 5, Free-Body Diagrams), and
      drawing the vector in the image of the system.  Does the
      applet's response agree with what you had anticipated?
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>.  Select a force from the Force drop-down
      menus by entering the combination "(normal, table, table)", and
      SUBMIT.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      The applet responds with the message "Not a force" in the
      Comment text field.  The table cannot exert a force on itself.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      Replace the third entry in "(normal, table, table)" by "earth"
      so that you have the combination "(normal, table, earth)", and
      SUBMIT.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      This time the applet responds by selecting the corresponding
      vector in the free-body diagram for the earth and drawing four
      force vectors with their tail ends on the surface of the earth
      at the points where the four legs of the table are standing on
      the earth.  See Figure 3 below.
	 </p>

      <img src="NormalTableVectors.gif" alt="(normal, table, earth) vector">
    <br><br>
      <b>Figure 3</b>
    </p>
	 <p>
      The one selected vector in the free-body diagram for the earth
      represents the total normal force exerted by the table on the
      earth which is the sum of the four normal forces exerted by the
      four legs of the table on the earth.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>.  Select a force from the Force drop-down
      menus by entering the combination "(gravitational, earth, box)",
      and SUBMIT.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      The applet responds by selecting the corresponding force vector
      in the free-body diagram for the box and drawing the vector with
      its tail end at the center of the box in the image of the
      box-table-earth system.  The center of gravity of the box is at
      the center of the box if the masses inside the box are uniformly
      distributed.  The gravitational force exerted by the earth on
      the box acts effectively at the center of gravity of the box.
    </p>
	 <p>
		Both the gravitational force vector in the free-body diagram for
      the box and in the image of the box-table-earth system are shown
      in green, which is the color used by the applet to indicate
      gravitational forces.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>.  Change the combination "(gravitational,
      earth, box)" to "(gravitational, table, box)", and SUBMIT.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      This time the applet responds in the Comment text field with
      "Negligible".  The gravitational force exerted by the table on
      the box is negligible and not included in the free-body diagram
      for the box.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      Change the word "gravitational" to "normal", and SUBMIT again.
      Does the applet respond in the manner you anticipate?

    <div class="sectionheading">
      Force Review Mode
    </div>
    <p>
	   The applet provides two methods for selecting a force:
    </p>   
    <ul>
      <li> 
        A. By selecting a force vector in a free-body diagram (the
        selected vector is shown highlighted in solid black, or in
        white with a black outline if a reaction force is selected in
        the Reaction Force Review mode).
      </li>
      <li>
        B. By describing a force verbally by means of either the Force
        or the Reaction Force pull-down menus.
      </li>
    </ul>
	 <p>
      In the following text, the two methods will be referred to as
      Method A and Method B.
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet, and select the Force Review
      mode by clicking the corresponding radio button, as illustrated
      in Figure 4 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="ForceReviewMode.gif" alt="Force Review Mode">
    <br><br>
      <b>Figure 4</b>
    </p>
	 <p>
      The applet responds by selecting a force, by either Method A or
      Method B.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      Select the same force using the other Method.  Thus, if the
      applet has used Method A, you use Method B, and vice versa.
      SUBMIT your response.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      If the applet responds with anything other than "Correct" in the
      Answer Quality text field, change your response and SUBMIT the
      new response.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  If, at the end of Exercise 1, the applet
      responds with "Correct" in the Comment text field, press NEXT to
      have the applet select another force.  Again, use the "other"
      Method to select the same force as that selected by the applet,
      and SUBMIT.
	 </p>
    <p align="right">
      <a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" alt="Back to Top" border="0"

    </p>
    <a name="ReactionForce"></a>
    <div class="sectionheading">
      Reaction Force Mode
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Select the Reaction Force
      mode by clicking the appropriate radio button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the three Force drop-down menus, select the gravitational
      force exerted by the earth on the box.  SUBMIT your selection.
    </p>
	 <p>
      The applet responds by selecting the corresponding vector in the
      free-body diagram for the box and adding the force vector to the
      image of the box-table-earth system.  In addition, the applet
      indicates, by both Methods A and B, what the corresponding
      Newton's-third-law reaction force is.  It also adds this force
      to the image of the system.  (Methods A and B are defined in the
      preceding section, "Force Review Mode".)
	 </p>
	 <p>
      Does the applet's response confirm what you anticipated?
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Select the normal force exerted by the table
      on the box by selecting this vector in the free-body diagram for
      the box.  Then SUBMIT your selection.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	   The applet responds by supplying the verbal description of the
	   force, characterized by the triplet "(normal, table, box)", and
	   adding the force vector to the image of the system.  See the
	   blue arrows in Figure 5 below.  They represent the normal force
	   exerted by the table on the box.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="NormalTableBox.gif" alt="(normal, table, box) force">
    <br><br>
      <b>Figure 5</b>
    </p>
	 <p>
      As in Exercise 1, the applet also indicates, by both Methods A
      and B, the corresponding Newton's-third-law reaction force.  It
      also adds this reaction force to the image of the system. Figure
      5 shows the reaction force in the free-body diagram for the
      table and in the image of the box-table-earth system.  The
      arrows representing the reaction force are in "inverted blue".
	 </p>
    <p>
      If the applet shows a triplet other than "(normal, table, box)"
      in the Force drop-down menus, you have selected the wrong vector
      from the free-body diagrams and you should try again.

    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet, and select the Reaction
      Force Review Mode.
    </p>
    <p>
	   The applet responds by selecting a force by both Methods A and B
	   and by drawing the force vector in the image of the
	   box-table-earth system.  (Methods A and B are defined in the
	   earlier section "Force Review" or in Help.)
    </p>
	 <p>
      Use either Method A or B to select the corresponding
      Newton's-third-law reaction force, and SUBMIT your selection.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		If you used Method B and the applet responds with the message
      "Incorrect" or "Not a force" or "Negligible" in the Comment text
      field, correct your response and SUBMIT again.
    </p>
	 <p>
		If the applet responds "Correct", the applet also selects the
      reaction force by the "other" Method and adds the reaction force
      vector to the image of the box-table-earth system.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      After "Correct", press the NEXT button to continue with another
      force.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Continuing from Exercise 1, click NEXT.
      Then, instead of selecting a reaction force, click GIVE UP.  The
      applet supplies the correct response for you.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      Click NEXT once more, but this time select the reaction force
      yourself.
