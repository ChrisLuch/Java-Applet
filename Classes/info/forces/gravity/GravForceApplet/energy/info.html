        <p>
          The Energy box (see Point 11 below) displays the potential
          and kinetic energies of the satellite-earth (or
          projectile-earth) system. The box displays two energy bars,
          labeled "initial" and "final". The bar labeled "final" shows
          the instantaneous potential and kinetic energies. The bar
          labeled "initial" represents a fixed set of potential and
          kinetic energies. By pressing the Initial button <img src=
          "../images/Lock.gif" alt="Lock Energies" align="top">, one
          causes the "initial" energy bar to represent the potential
          and kinetic energies at that moment. When subsequently the
          motion is played, the "initial" energy bar will continue to
          display the initial energies while the "final" bar will keep
          changing throughout the motion to represent the potential
          and kinetic energies at any given moment during the motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being able to set the "initial" bar before starting the
          motion allows comparison of the energies at any moment
          during the motion with the initial energies.

          angle &theta; of the velocity.
          &theta; is measured in the positive
          sense relative to the positive <i>x</i>-axis.

          After typing new values into one or two of the fields,
          hit ENTER to make them effective.

          During the motion, these entry fields are constantly
          being updated and show the current velocity.
        </p>
	<p>
          When the velocity vector is displayed, the velocity can also
          be changed by dragging the tip of the velocity vector.
          However, the Coordinates button should be deselected,
          because otherwise clicking on the tip of the velocity vector
          will cause a "+" point marker to be placed there.

          The position of the projectile or satellite can also be

          Coordinates button is not selected.  If the Coordinates
          button is selected, clicking on the projectile or satellite
          will cause a "+" point marker to be placed there.

              Energy Bars

        </p>
        <p>
          When the Data button is selected, two draggable information
          boxes are displayed. One of them is the Energy box shown
          above. The other one is the Data box. You may close either
          box by clicking the "X" in the top right corner of the
          box. This will not close the other box.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Energy box displays two energy bars, labeled
          "initial" and "final". Both bars represent the potential
          energy <i>PE</i> of the satellite-earth (or
          projectile-earth) system (in blue) and the kinetic energy
          <i>KE</i> of the system in red.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bar labeled "final" shows the instantaneous energies
          during the motion and also while the initial position and
          velocity are being set. The bar labeled "initial" does not
          change during the motion. It can be made to represent the
          energies corresponding to the initial setting of position
          and velocity by pressing the Initial button <img
          src="../images/Lock.gif" alt="Lock Energies" align="top">
          before pressing PLAY. That way the "initial" bar will show
          the potential and kinetic energies at the time the Initial
          button is pressed and will allow comparison of these
          energies with the instantaneous energies during the motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          By dragging the short horizontal bar across the vertical
          Zoom bar on the right in the Energy box up or down, you can
          change the scale of the energy bars.  Changing the energy
          scale is necessary to be able to bring the top end of the
          energy bars into view for certain values of the potential and
          kinetic energies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the level of the potential energy value at
          <i>PE</i> = -<i>mgR</i> is held fixed during these scale
          changes. This is the value of the potential energy
          <i>PE</i> when the satellite (or projectile) is at the
          surface of the earth.
