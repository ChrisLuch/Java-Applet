<div class="title">Assumptions - Weight and Orbits</div>

<p><div class="sectionheading">The applet simulates projectile motion
 and satellite motion in the earth's gravitational field. The
 viewpoint can be changed from a point close to the earth's surface to
 a point far from the earth's surface.</div>

    <p>The applet makes the following assumptions:

	 <p><ul>

	 <li>The earth is perfectly spherical with a radius <i>R</i> =
	 6.378&times;10<sup>3</sup> km.</li>

	 <li>The earth's density is uniform throughout the earth.</li>

	 <li>The acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the earth
	 has the magnitude <i>g</i> = 9.805 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</li>

	 <li>The projectile or satellite is subject only to the earth's
	 gravitational force, not to air resistance or any other kind of
	 force.</li>

    <li>The earth is not rotating about its axis.

    <p>Put differently, the applet simulates the motion of a satellite
    or projectile relative to a coordinate system that is held fixed
    relative to the fixed stars (inertial frame of reference), and the
    rotation of the earth relative to this system is not
    simulated.</li>

	 </ul>

	 <p>A consequence of the first two assumptions is that the force of
	 gravity exerted by the earth on an object above the surface of the
	 earth is the same as that exerted by a point particle whose mass
	 is equal to that of the earth and which is located at the center
	 of the earth.

    <p>The last assumption implies that the motion of a projectile
    relative to an earth-fixed coordinate system (rotating
    non-inertial reference frame) is simulated without the Coriolis
    and centrifugal forces.  These fictitious forces would affect the
    motion of a projectile relative to an earth-fixed set of axes in
    the realistic case in which the earth is rotating.
