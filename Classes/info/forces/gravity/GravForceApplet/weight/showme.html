      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Prepare the applet for observing the
      satellite's motion.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Reset <img src="../images/Reset.gif" alt="Reset" align=
        "top"> the applet. 
        <p>
          The magenta velocity vector should be visible. The tail
          end of this vector is at the satellite. You can hide or
          display the velocity vector by deselecting or selecting
          this vector from the Vector panel. To open the Vector
          panel, select the Vectors button <img src=
          "../images/Vectors.gif" alt="Vectors" align="top">.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the time being, keep the velocity vector displayed
          and also display the gravitational force acting on the
          satellite by selecting the vector from the Vector panel.
          The magnitude of this force is the satellite's weight
          <i>W</i>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Initial Position and Velocity</u>. Enter the values
        <i>v</i> = 8,800 m/s and &theta; = 0
        in the second row of the velocity entry fields, and press
        ENTER. Don't forget to press ENTER, because otherwise the
        applet will not recognize the new values. The velocity
        vector arrow and the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components of
        the velocity data fields will be adjusted accordingly. The
        velocity vector should now be horizontal pointing to the
        right. 
        <p>
          Enter the values <i>x</i> = 0 and <i>y</i> = 10 km in the
          position data entry fields, and press ENTER. The
          satellite will be moved to a point just above the north
          pole (top) of the earth. Drag the Data box out of the way
          if necessary to see the satellite.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <u>Scale Setting</u>. After Reset, the distance scale is
          set at 100 pix = 1,000 km. Change the scale setting to
          100 pix = 10,000 km by clicking the second radio button
          to the right of the present one. All distances will now
          be shown ten times smaller and the velocity vector arrow
          somewhat smaller as well. In general, the length of the
          arrow representing the velocity (but not the actual
          velocity value) is adjusted as the distance scale is
          changed, but by a smaller factor than the distances or
          for some scale changes not at all. It is not important to
          know by what factor the length of the arrow representing
          the velocity is adjusted.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Trace</u>. Select the trace button <img src=
        "../images/Trace.gif" alt="trace" align="top"> to show
        the satellite's path when the satellite is in motion.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Click PLAY <img src="../images/Play.gif"
      alt="Play" align="top">, and observe the following aspects of
      the satellite's motion:
    </p>
    <ul>

    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. At any moment during the motion, in which
      direction does the velocity vector point?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. How does the magnitude of the velocity,
      the speed, vary during the motion? Where is it largest, where
      is it smallest?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 3</b>. At any moment during the motion, in which
      direction do the satellite's acceleration and the force of
      gravity acting on the satellite point?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 4</b>. How does the magnitude of the force of
      gravity (the satellite's weight) vary during the motion? How
      does it vary with the satellite's distance from the center of
      the earth? Is it ever zero?

      In this section, you will observe the motion at different
      settings of the distance scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Click REWIND <img src=
      "../images/Rewind.gif" alt="Rewind" align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      The satellite will be reset to its starting position. Notice
      that the old trace from Figure 1 is now shown in grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make no changes in any of the previous settings, except in
      the scale. Change it from 100 pix = 10,000 km to 100 pix =
      1,000 km by clicking the radio button two positions to the
      left of the presently selected radio button. This will be the
      third radio button from the left. Notice that the trace now
      appears jagged. This is the grey trace in Figure 2 below. The
      reason is that the trace, like all other distances, is
      magnified in this scale setting relative to the earlier one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In simulating the satellite's motion, the computer has to
      calculate in discrete time steps. The satellite's path is
      drawn as a straight line during each such time step. At the
      first scale setting, these straight lines were too short to
      be seen and the trace appeared to be smooth. However, they
      show up when one magnifies them, as in the present scale
      setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Keeping the scale at 100 pix = 1,000 km,
      click PLAY and wait until the satellite has completed one
      revolution. You should be able to observe two things.
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) The new trace (in blue) is much smoother than the old
      one. See Figure 2 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="../images/WOTraces.gif" alt="Scale Change">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) It takes much longer, in terms of the time shown by your
      wrist watch, for the satellite to complete one revolution in
      the "100 pix = 1,000 km" scale setting than in the "100 pix =
      10,000 km" setting. (Of course, the time per revolution of a
      real satellite is independent of the scale setting. This
      "real" time is the time shown in the Data box that you can
      display by selecting the Data button <img src=
      "../images/Data.gif" alt="Data" align="top">.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that explains both observations is that the applet
      uses smaller time steps in simulating a motion when one zooms
      in and the distances represented by 100 pixels get shorter.
      The applet is designed so that, roughly speaking, the number
      of time steps used for a motion to go through 100 pixels is
      the same at every scale setting. That way, motions will
      always look smooth and motions that go way beyond the window
      size at a given scale setting will require much more time to
      execute than motions whose range lies within the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Click REWIND. Don't change any of the
      settings, except for the scale. Set that to the most
      zoomed-in setting "100 pix = 10 km", but don't change any of
      the other settings. The previous traces will all appear as a
      single straight grey line 10 km above the surface of the
      earth. There are no jagged edges in the traces because during
      one time step at the previous scale setting the satellite
      traveled a distance greater than that represented by the
      applet window in the present scale setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion, and observe the values of <i>x</i> and
      <i>y</i>. It will take a long time on your wrist watch until
      the satellite completes its revolution. You may not want to
      wait that long. You can estimate this time from observing how
      the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values are progressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Click REWIND, and change the initial speed
      to a value more appropriate to the "100 pix = 10 km" distance
      scale, e.g., <i>v</i> = 600 m/s. Keep the initial direction
      angle equal to 0. Make no other changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion. If you choose the initial velocity value
      suggested and display the grid by clicking the Grid button
      <img src="../images/Grid.gif" alt="Grid" align="top">, to be
      able to visualize the distances better, you should get the
      trajectory shown in blue in Figure 3 below.

    </div>
    <p>
      The shape of a satellite's orbit or a projectile's trajectory
      depends on the initial conditions, i.e., the initial position
      and velocity. Try to find initial conditions that will
      produce a circular orbit at a height of 10,000 km above the
      surface of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Set the scale to 100 pix
      = 10,000 km, and set the initial position to
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../images/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
         width="20"><i>x</i> = 0, <img src="../images/small.gif"
         alt="space" height="1" width="20"><i>y</i> = 10,000 km
    </p>
    <p>
      by entering these values in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> data
      entry fields and pressing ENTER. Don't forget to press ENTER.
      Otherwise, the applet will not know about these values. This
      initial position is shown in Figure 4 below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Set the initial velocity angle
         &theta; to 0, and press ENTER. This
         way the orbit will at least start out in the right
         direction, i.e., perpendicular to the radius.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the velocity vector is selected, the magenta arrow should
      now be pointing horizontal and to the right, as in Figure 4
      below.

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 4</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Now use trial and error to find the
      initial speed that will yield a circular orbit (or, at least,
      an approximately circular orbit). Set an initial value of the
      speed <i>v</i>, and PLAY the simulation with the trace
      displayed. If the resulting path is not circular, click
      REWIND, change the initial value of <i>v</i>, and try again.
      Continue in this manner until you have an orbit that looks
      very nearly circular. See Figure 5 below for a succession of
      orbits obtained in this manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Helpful suggestion</b>. To make it easier to judge how
      close you are to a circular orbit, mark a second point in the
      applet window through which a circular trajectory would have
      to pass. E.g., mark the point on the circle that is directly
      to the right of the center of the earth. This point is at

    <p>
      To mark the point, select the Point Coordinates button
      <img src="../images/Coordinates.gif" alt="Coordinates"
         align="top">, click in the applet window, and drag the
         mouse while the mouse button is depressed. The coordinates
         at the center of the crosshairs will be displayed. Adjust
         them to the pair of values you want, and release the mouse
         button.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adjustment is made easier if you adjust one of the two
      coordinates first, say, the <i>x</i>-coordinate. When that
      coordinate is equal to the value you want, release the mouse
      button, press the Shift-key and keep it down while pressing
      the mouse button again and dragging the mouse up or down. The
      <i>x</i>-coordinate will be held fixed while you adjust the
      <i>y</i>-coordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the applet will not let you make position
      adjustments to more than three significant figures. At best,
      it will let you set your point at
