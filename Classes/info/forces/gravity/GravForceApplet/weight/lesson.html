<p><b>Prerequisites</b>

<p>Students should be familiar with the concept of acceleration and
the properties of acceleration in circular motion as summarized below.
They should be familiar with Newton's second law and Newton's
universal law of gravitation.

<p><b>Learning Outcomes</b>

<p>Students will develop an understanding of how the gravitational
force exerted by the earth on a satellite varies in magnitude in
proportion to the inverse square of the distance of the satellite from
the center of the earth and how the expression for the gravitational
force in combination with Newton's second law of motion can explain
both satellite motion (far from the earth) and projectile motion
(close to the earth).

 <li><b>Theorem on Acceleration in Uniform Circular Motion</b>  

 <blockquote>A mathematical analysis of the definition of acceleration as
 time-rate-of-change of velocity shows that in uniform circular motion
 the acceleration is purely radial in direction and directed to the
 center of the circle (centripetal) and that the magnitude <i>a</i> of
 the acceleration is equal to

 <p align="center"><i>a</i> = <i>d</i>&omega;<sup>2</sup> =
 <i>v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>d</i>
 <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (1)</p>
 
 <p>where <i>d</i> the radius of the circle, and &omega; and <i>v</i>
 the angular speed and speed,
 respectively, of the particle in circular motion.</blockquote></li>

 <p><li><b>Newton's Second Law</b>

  <p><blockquote>The sum of all forces <img src="../images/F.gif"

 <p><li><b>Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation</b>

 <blockquote>Any two particles of masses <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and
 <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> exert attractive gravitational forces on each
 other.  Particle 1 exerts a force on Particle 2 that is directed
 towards Particle 1 and, vice versa, Particle 2 exerts a force on
 Particle 1 that is directed towards Particle 2.  Both forces have the

<p> <a name="Weight"><div class="sectionheading">Weight at Different
Distances from the Earth</div></a>

  <p>RESET the applet, and set the distance scale to 100 pix = 10,000
  km.  You may want to display the grid by selecting the Grid button.

  <p>Move the satellite to the north pole by setting <i>x</i> and
  <i>y</i> equal to 0.  Display the Data box by selecting the Data
  button, and note that the weight <i>W</i> of the satellite is shown
  to be 392.2 N.

  <p><b>Question 1</b>.  Is the value <i>W</i> = 392.2 N consistent
  with the satellite's mass <i>m</i> given as 40 kg in the Data box?
  Note the value of the magnitude <i>a</i> of the satellite's
  acceleration which is also provided in the Data box.  

  <p><b>Note</b>. The acceleration shown in the Data box applies when
  the satellite is not resting on the earth and moving subject to the
  force of gravity only.  It is therefore called the <i>acceleration
  due to gravity</i>.  In this Lesson, the magnitude of this
  acceleration for a point at the surface of the earth is denoted
  <i>g</i>.  Thus, the symbol <i>g</i> denotes a constant in this
  Lesson.  Elsewhere, the symbol <i>g</i> may denote the variable
  (magnitude of the) acceleration due to gravity at arbitrary points
  away from the earth.

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  The force of gravity is the only force acting on
  the satellite when the satellite is coasting.  (Pretend the
  satellite is just above the surface of the earth and moving freely.)
  Then Newton's second law implies

  <p align="center"><i>W</i> = <i>m a</i> = 40&times;9.805 = 392.2 N
  .</p>

  <p><b>Question 2</b>.  What is the satellite's weight at a point one
  earth radius above the surface of the earth?  Consider Newton's law
  of universal gravitation in obtaining the answer.

  <p>To check your answer, position the satellite at <i>x</i> = 0 and
  <i>y</i> = 6,378 km by entering these values in the Position Data
  Entry fields and then pressing ENTER.  The weight at this point will
  be shown in the Data box.

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  The weight is 98.05 N, which is one fourth of the
  weight at the surface of the earth.  The reason for this reduction
  by a factor of 4 is as follows.

  <p>Newton's law of universal gravitation implies that the magnitude
  of the force of gravity exerted by the earth on the satellite, i.e.,
  the satellite's weight, is inversely proportional to the square of
  the distance between the earth and the satellite, where this
  distance has to be taken from the center of the earth, not from the
  surface.

  <p>When the satellite is moved from the earth's surface, i.e., from
  a point a distance <i>d</i> = <i>R</i> from the earth's center, to a
  point one earth radius above the earth's surface, where <i>d</i> =
  2<i>R</i>, the distance <i>d</i> from the earth's center is doubled.
  Therefore the satellite's weight is multiplied by 1/2<sup>2</sup> =
  1/4.  For more detail, see Question 4 below.

  <p><b>Comment</b>.  Why do we have to take the distance from the
  center of the earth, not from the surface?  The reason is as
  follows.

  <p>Fundamentally, Newton's law of universal gravitation makes a
  statement only about the forces that two <b>point</b> particles
  exert on each other.  Since the earth is certainly not a point
  particle, one must calculate the force that this extended object
  exerts on a satellite by summing all gravitational forces that the
  individual infinitesimal parts of the earth exert on the satellite.
  Fortunately, this calculation, which can be done using calculus, has
  a neat and simple result.

  <p>The result is that, at points outside the earth, the
  gravitational force exerted by the earth on a satellite is identical
  to what it would be if the earth were a point particle located at
  the center of the earth with the entire mass of the earth
  concentrated there.  This result can be derived assuming the earth
  is a perfect sphere and the earth's mass is distributed uniformly
  inside the earth.  We'll make these assumptions.

  <p><b>Question 3</b>.  What is the weight of the satellite at a
  point that is two earth radii above the surface of the earth?

  <p><b>Hint</b>.  Try a similar line of reasoning as in Question 2.
  Then check your answer with the applet.

  <p><b>Question 4 (Challenge)</b>.  Derive a general expression for
  the magnitude <i>W</i> of a satellite's weight in terms of 

  <p><ul>

  <li>the satellite's mass <i>m</i>,</li> 

  <li>the magnitude <i>g</i> of the acceleration due to gravity at the
  surface of the earth,</li>

  <li>the distance <i>d</i> of the satellite from the center of the
  earth,</li> 

  <li>and the radius <i>R</i> of the earth.</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  If <i>M</i> denotes the mass of the earth, then
  the magnitude of the force of gravity exerted by the earth on the
  satellite, i.e., the satellite's weight <i>W</i>, at a distance
  <i>d</i> from the earth's center is given by

  <p align="center"><i>W</i> = <i>GMm</i> / <i>d</i><sup>2</sup>
  . <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">(5)

  <p>By multiplying Expression (5) by
  <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 1 and rearranging, one
  can write it in the form

  <p align="center"><i>W</i> = [<i>GMm</i> / <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>]
  (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>)<sup>2</sup> . <img src="../images/small.gif"
  height="1" width="40">(6)

  <p>It turns out that the expression in square brackets is equal to
  <i>mg</i>.  This can be shown as follows.

  <p>Let us consider a satellite just above the surface of the earth,
  so that <i>d</i> = <i>R</i>.  The acceleration of such a satellite
  has the magnitude <i>g</i>, if the only force acting on the
  satellite is the force of gravity.  In this situation, Newton's
  second law with Expression (5) substituted for the net force acting
  on the satellite gives the equation

  <p align="center"><i>GMm</i> / <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>m g</i>
  .<img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (7)

  <p>With Equ.(7), Expression (6) for <i>W</i> can be simplified to 

  <p align="center"><i>W</i> = <i>mg</i>
  (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>)<sup>2</sup>. <img src="../images/small.gif"
  height="1" width="40">(8).

  <p>This expression for <i>W</i> has the desired form.

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>.  Use Expression (8) to rederive the answers to
  Questions 2 and 3.

  <p><b>Question 5</b>.  Reset the applet, and set the scale setting
  to 100 pix = 10 km.  This is the most zoomed-in setting.  The
  satellite will be outside of the bounds of the window.  Set <i>x</i>
  = <i>y</i> = 0 to move the satellite back to the north pole.

  <p>Display the force of gravity (green arrow) acting on the
  satellite (or projectile), and display the Data box.  Then drag the
  satellite around the window with the mouse and observe the changes in the
  force vector and in the value of the weight <i>W</i> shown in the
  Data box.

  <p>You should find that there is very little change, no noticeable
  change in the direction of the force and very little change in its
  magnitude.  How do you explain this?

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  The explanation is that, at this scale setting,
  the distance changes that are possible within the window are just
  tiny fractions of the radius of the earth.  Equ.(8) implies that
  significant changes in the weight occur only when the distance from
  the surface of the earth changes by amounts comparable to the radius
  of the earth.

  <p><b>Exercise 2</b>. Set the scale to 100 pix = 1,000 km, and move
  the satellite to a point one tenth of an earth radius above the
  surface of the earth or about 600 km above the surface of the earth.
  Use the applet to determine the decrease of the weight in percent,
  and derive the value you obtain from Expression (8).

<p> 

  <a name="Motion"><div class="sectionheading">Weight and Motion</div></a>

  <p>Let us investigate if and how the weight and the acceleration of
  a satellite change during the satellite's motion.

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.  Display the magenta
  velocity and the green force of gravity vectors.  Also display the
  Data box in order to find out about the satellite's weight <i>W</i>
  (at the bottom of the list).

  <p>Vary the satellite's initial velocity by dragging the tip of the
  velocity vector.  Do you observe any changes in the force of gravity
  acting on the satellite or the value of the weight shown in the Data
  box?  (Note that, even though the satellite's motion is not
  simulated until you click PLAY, the vectors and values simulated by
  the applet are those that apply to an instant while the satellite is
  moving.  Pretend you are looking at a snapshot of the motion.)

  <p>Explain your observations in view of Newton's universal law of
  gravitation.  According to this law, does the force of gravity
  depend on the velocities of the interacting objects?

  <p><b>Exercise 2</b>.  Select the Trace and Grid buttons, and PLAY
  the motion.  Observe the force of gravity vector during the motion,
  as well as the weight in the Data box.  Do either of them change?

  <p>The answer should be YES.  During the motion, the force of
  gravity is changing direction relative to the fixed <i>x</i> and
  <i>y</i> axes so that it keeps pointing towards the center of the
  earth.  The magnitude of this force changes as the satellite's
  elevation changes.

  <p><b>Exercise 3</b>.  Check if the satellite's weight depends on
  the state of motion of the satellite.

  <p>REWIND the applet, and then drag the satellite to a given point on its
  trajectory.  Note the satellite's weight at that point.  Click
  REWIND again, and this time PLAY the motion.  When the satellite
  passes the given point, what is its weight?  You may want to pause
  the motion there to read the value of the weight better.

  <p>You may also want to find a different orbit for the satellite,
  with different initial position and velocity, that takes the
  satellite through the given point, and again observe the satellite's
  weight at that point.

  <p>You should find that the weight, and the force of gravity, depend
  merely on the satellite's position, not on the satellite's velocity
  or the orbit it may be maintaining while passing that position.  The
  force of gravity acting on the satellite is determined by the
  position of the satellite relative to the center of the earth.  It
  does not depend on the satellite's velocity.

  <p><b>Question 1</b>.  Is the satellite ever "weightless" in any orbit?

  <p>Experiment with different orbits in different scale settings.

  <p><b>Anwer</b>.  The satellite is never weightless.  The force of
  gravity acting on the satellite is non-zero as long as the
  satellite is not infinitely far away from the center of the earth.

  <p><b>Exercise 4</b>.  Repeat Exercises 1 to 3, but observe the
  satellite's acceleration, i.e., the acceleration due to gravity,
  instead of the force of gravity acting on the satellite.  What do
  you observe?

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  Your observations for the acceleration due to
  gravity should be analogous to those for the fore of gravity: both
  depend only on the position of the satellite, not the satellite's
  velocity.

  <p><b>Question 2</b>.  A satellite's weight depends on the mass
  <i>m</i> of the satellite.  What about the satellite's acceleration?
  Can two satellites of different mass that are subject only to the
  force of gravity have different accelerations?

  <p>This is a "theoretical" question, because the applet does not let
  you vary the mass of the satellite.

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  Satellites of different mass that are affected
  only by the force of gravity have the same acceleration at the same
  point in space.  The reason lies in Newton's second law when applied
  to the satellite in combination with Newton's universal law of
  gravitation.  Let <img src="../images/Wcap.gif" align="bottom"> denote
  the force
  of gravity acting on the satellite.  Newton's second law gives
  for the satellite's acceleration <img src="../images/a.gif" align="bottom">
  the equation

  <p align="center"><img src="../images/Wcap.gif" align="bottom"> =
  <i>m</i><img
  src="../images/a.gif" align="bottom"> .
  <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (9)

  <p>According to the law of universal gravition, <img
  src="../images/Wcap.gif" align="bottom"> is proportional to
  <i>m</i>.  So is the right-hand side of Equ.(9).  Therefore, the
  factor <i>m</i> can be canceled out of the equation, so that <img
  src="../images/a.gif" align="bottom"> does not depend on <i>m</i>.

  <p>Thus, the acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass
  of a satellite or projectile.  This also implies that all objects
  that are released from rest fall equally fast, an important discovery
  made by Galileo more than 400 years ago.

  <p><b>Exercise 5</b>.  RESET the applet, and switch the scale setting
  to 100 pix = 10 km.  The applet is now set to a distance scale
  appropriate for observing <i>projectile motion</i>, which is motion
  near the surface of the earth with trajectories that start and end
  on the surface of the earth.

  <p>Set the initial velocity so that the motion will not go beyond
  the applet window, PLAY the motion, and observe the acceleration due
  to gravity.

  <p>You should be able to observe that the magnitude of the
  acceleration due to gravity remains equal to 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>,
  within two significant digits, and that the variation in this
  magnitude is very small, even though the projectile can move to
  elevations of more than 10 km above the surface of the earth.

  <p>Also, the direction of the acceleration is very nearly in the
  <i>y</i>-direction at all times.

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="../images/top.gif" border ="0"

<p>
  <a name="Circular"><div class="sectionheading">Circular
  Orbits</div></a>

    <p>In this section, you will investigate what initial conditions
    are required for a circular orbit.

	 <p><b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet, and keep the scale
	 setting at 100 pix = 1,000 km.  Display the Grid and the velocity
	 vector.  Set the particle's position to 1,000 km above the north
	 pole, i.e., to <i>x</i> = 0 and <i>y</i> = 1,000 km.  Set the
	 initial velocity to 0.

	 <p>What motion would you expect to result from these initial
	 conditions?  PLAY the motion and check.  Check the Data box to see
	 how much time elapses until the satellite hits the earth.

	 <p><b>Comments</b>.  You should find that the satellite drops
	 straight down and hits the earth in 512 s.

	 <p>The explanation, of course, is that the force of gravity and
	 therefore the satellite's acceleration is directed towards the
	 center of the earth.  If the initial velocity is zero and all
	 velocity increases are straight down, then the satellite's
	 velocity at all times must be straight down as well.

	 <p><b>Exercise 2</b>.  The calculation of the time elapsed in
	 Exercise 1 requires calculus because the satellite's acceleration
	 is not constant on the way down.  As the Data box shows, the
	 acceleration increases in magnitude from 7.327 m/s<sup>2</sup> at
	 the start to 9.805 m/s<sup>2</sup> when the satellite reaches the
	 ground.

	 <p>Nevertheless, the acceleration does not vary by more than 15%
	 and taking a mean value of 8.5 m/s<sup>2</sup> and assuming
	 constant acceleration with this mean value should not give too bad
	 a value for the time elapsed.  Determine an approximate value for
	 the time elapsed using this approach.

	 <p><b>Answer</b>.  The distance <i>s</i> traveled in straight-line
	 motion starting from rest with constant acceleration of magnitude
	 <i>a</i> during a time interval of magnitude <i>t</i> is given by

	 <p align="center"><i>s</i> = (<i>a</i>/2) <i>t</i><sup>2</sup>
	 . <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (10)

	 <p>Solving for <i>t</i> and substituting the present values gives

	 <p align="center"><i>t</i> = <img src="../images/root16.gif">
  [2<i>s</i>/<i>a</i>] = <img src="../images/root16.gif">
  [2&times;1&times;10<sup>6</sup>/8.5] = 485 s. <img
  src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (11)

    <p>This value for the time elapsed is only about 5% off the
    correct value of 512 s.

	 <p><b>Exercise 3</b>.  REWIND the applet, and set the initial velocity
	 to <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = 3,000 m/s and <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> = 0.
	 This velocity is in a direction tangential to the circular orbit
	 through this starting point.  If we want the satellite to move in
	 this circular orbit, its velocity at this point would have to have
	 this direction (or the opposite direction).

	 <p>Select the Trace button, and PLAY the motion.  Note down the
	 value shown in the Data box for the time elapsed until the
	 satellite hits the ground.

	 <p><b>Comment</b>.  The satellite moves in a curved trajectory
	 and hits the ground after 563 s.  See Figure 1 below.  This is
	 longer than the 512 s for vertical fall.

	 <p align="center"><img src="../images/WOBelowCircle.gif"></p>

	 <p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

	 <p>The explanation for the increase in time is that the earth
	 curves away underneath the satellite as the satellite moves to the
	 right.  The force of gravity is still accelerating the satellite
	 in the negative <i>y</i>-direction (but also somewhat in the
	 negative <i>x</i>-direction; note the acceleration vector), but the
	 satellite has to fall farther in the negative <i>y</i>-direction
	 to reach the earth.  Thus, more time is required.  Also, the
	 <i>y</i>-component of the acceleration is slightly less in
	 magnitude than for the vertical fall in Exercise 1. Why?

	 <p><b>Exercise 4</b>.  When the satellite is in a circular orbit,
	 the time to complete one revolution ought to be greater than the
	 time until impact for any orbit that ends up at the surface of the
	 earth.  To increase the time of flight and have the orbit go
	 beyond the previous one, we need to increase the satellite's
	 initial speed.

	 <p>Repeatedly clicking REWIND, and gradually increasing the
	 initial speed, to 4,000 m/s, then 5,000 m/s, etc.,
	 always maintaining the direction from Exercise 3,
	 obtain a value for the initial speed at which the satellite's
	 orbit is very nearly circular.  You may want to change the scale
	 setting to a more zoomed-out view, e.g., 100 pix = 10,000 km, so
	 that the entire earth is in view.  At such a setting, the
	 simulation will also require less time to execute.

	 <p><b>Comments</b>.  

	 <p><ol> 

	 <li>You should find that for an initial speed of 7,000 m/s the
	 satellite still does not make it around the earth, but that for
	 8,000 m/s the orbit is an ellipse that is larger than the circle
	 through the staring point.  You can then try to find a good
	 approximate value in between these two.</li>

	 <li>In circular motion, as in any other motion of a satellite,
	 there is a gravitational force acting on the satellite pulling the
	 satellite towards the center of the earth.  (If this force were
	 absent, the satellite would move off in a straight line.)
	 Nevertheless, the satellite does not come closer to the earth
	 because of its tangential velocity and the earth's curvature.  The
	 satellite is accelerating towards the earth, but it is also moving
	 sideways at the same time.  The combined motion is circular
	 motion.</li>

	 </ol>


	 <p><b>Problem 1</b>.  Calculate the exact value of the initial
	 speed that will produce a circular orbit through the point
	 <i>x</i> = 0 and <i>y</i> = 1,000 km.

	 <p><b>Answer</b>.  Taking magnitudes on both sides of the
	 Newton's-second-law equation (9) and using Expression (8) for the
	 weight <i>W</i>, gives the following equation:

	 <p align="center"><i>mg</i> (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>)<sup>2</sup> =
	 <i>ma</i> .<img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (12)

	 <p>Canceling a factor of <i>m</i> on both sides, gives an equation
	 for the magnitude <i>a</i> of the satellite's acceleration,

    <p align="center"><i>g</i> (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>)<sup>2</sup> =
    <i>a</i> .<img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (13)

	 <p>In uniform circular motion, <i>a</i> is given by the kinematic
	 expression (1),

	 <p align="center"><i>a</i> = <i>v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>d</i> .<img
	 src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (1)</p>

	 <p>Substituting Expression (1) into Equ.(13) gives the following
	 equation involving the speed <i>v</i>:

    <p align="center"><i>g</i> (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>)<sup>2</sup> =                                     
    <i>v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>d</i> .<img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
    width="40"> (14)</p>

	 <p>Solving for <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> and substituting the given
	 values, with <i>d</i> = <i>R</i> + 1,000 km =
	 7.378&times;10<sup>6</sup>m, gives

	 <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"><i>v</i><sup>2</sup>
