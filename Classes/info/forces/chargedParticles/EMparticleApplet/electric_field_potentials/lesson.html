          <u>Comment 1</u>. Electric fields produced by source
          charges at rest, i.e., fields that are superpositions of
          fields due to point charges at rest, are called
          <i>electrostatic</i> fields. Coulomb's law implies that

          Therefore, for an electrostatic field, dividing

          This is true in general for all kinds of electric fields,

          When one obtains force expression (5) in this way, it may
          seem to amount to nothing more than the definition of the
          electric field. However, it is not trivial that in a
          general electric field the force exerted on a test
          particle is proportional to the particle's charge
          <i>q</i> (or that the ratio in Definition (4) is
          independent of the charge in more general than just
          electrostatic cases).
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 3</u>. Definition (4) implies that the SI-unit
          of the electric field is N/C. This unit is equal to the
          unit V/m, which is discussed in Comment 1 under "Electric
          Potential and Equipotential Lines" below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 4</u>. The electric field is defined at all
          points in space. It is therefore not a single vector, but
          a "vector-valued function defined on space". This simply
          means that to describe the electric field one must
          specify the vectors <img src="../elpotimages/E.gif"
             alt="vector E" align="top"> at all points in space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 5</u>. An <i>electric field line</i> is a line
          (not a straight line in general) that indicates the
          direction of the electric field vectors at points along
          the line.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The electric field vector at a given point on an
          <i>electric field line</i> is tangential to the line at
          that point.

        <p>
          A static electric field, i.e., a field accompanying one
          or more source charges at rest, has the property that it
          can be derived from a simpler field called the
          <i>electric potential</i>. The electric potential field
          is simpler because it is a scalar field, not a vector
          field like the electric field. The electric potential
          field assigns a scalar quantity to any given point in
          space called the <i>electric potential at that point</i>.
          The SI-unit of the electric potential is the volt (V).
        </p>
        <p>
          How can a scalar field give rise to a vector field? A
          static electric field is constructed from its electric
          potential field as follows.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Suppose you know the electric potential field and want to
          know the electric field vector at a given point P. Look
          at the electric potential in the neighborhood of P. Find
          the direction leading away from P in which the electric
          potential decreases more rapidly than in any other
          direction. This is the direction in which the electric
          vector at P points. 
          <p>
            The magnitude <i>E</i> of the electric vector at P is
            equal to the magnitude of the distance-rate-of-change
            of the electric potential,

            rapid decrease of <i>V</i> and where <i>d</i> is the
            distance between P and P'.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the electric potential is constant throughout a
            small neighborhood of P or if the electric potential
            has a maximum or minimum at P, the electric field at P
            is zero.

        <p>
          <u>Comment 1</u>. Definition (6) implies that the SI-unit
          for the electric field is the V/m. As mentioned in
          Comment 3 under "Definition of Electric Field and
          Electric Field Lines" above, Definition (4) gives the N/C
          as the SI-unit of the electric field. Equating the two
          units and solving the resulting equation for V gives the
          volt in terms of other SI-units,

          <u>Comment 2</u>. For a uniform field, the limit in
          Definition (6) is not necessary and one can calculate

          <i>d</i>. This equation can be inverted to give the

          <i>V</i>(P') - <i>V</i>(P) in electric potential in going
          from point P to P'. If P', when seen from P, is in the
          direction of the electric field, i.e., in the direction
          of most rapid decrease of <i>V</i>, then

          where <i>d</i> is the distance between P and P'. The

          <u>Comment 3</u>. In general, the potential in the
          vicinity of a given point P will be decreasing in some
          directions, increasing in others, and remain constant
          along a line through P dividing the directions of
          decreasing and increasing potential. This dividing line
          is the "equipotential line" through P.

          An <i>equipotential line</i> is a line along which the
          electric potential is constant.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Such lines are not straight in general. However, in the
          present case of a uniform field, the equipotential lines
          are straight lines perpendicular to the electric field
          lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that one is dealing with equipotential <b>lines</b>
          when considering only <b>two</b> dimensions. In three
          dimensions, one has equipotential <b>surfaces</b>. In a
          uniform field in three dimensions, the equipotential
          surfaces are planes perpendicular to the electric field
          lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 4</u>. The electric field vector at a given
          point is always perpendicular to the equipotential line
          through that point because the perpendicular direction is
          the direction of most rapid change of the potential. As a
          consequence, electric field lines and equipotential lines
          cross at right angles at any given point.

          <u>Comment 1</u>. Equ.(11) is the same as Equ.(5).
          Equ.(10) is a definition of the potential energy in terms
          of the electric potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 2</u>. The vector <img src=
          "../elpotimages/E.gif" alt="vector E" align="bottom"> is
          different in general at different points in space. So is
          the force <img src="../elpotimages/F.gif" alt="vector F"
          align="bottom"> a function of position. Thus, Equation
          (11) defines a <i>force field</i>. In this applet, this
          force field is uniform, i.e., <img src=
          "../elpotimages/F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"> is
          the same vector at all points.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the electric potential is a scalar field,
          Definition (10) makes the potential energy of a test
          particle a scalar field as well. All this means is that
          the potential energy is a scalar quantity whose value
          depends in general on where the test particle is.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 3</u>. The electric field points from high to
          low potential, in the direction of the most rapid
          decrease of the potential. Because of Eqs.(10) and (11),
          the force points from high to low potential energy, in
          the direction of the most rapid decline of the potential
          energy. This statement is obviously true for positive
          charge <i>q</i>, but it is true also for negative charge.
          Why?
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 4</u>. Equ.(7) says that the volt is equal to
          1 J/C. Therefore, the SI-unit of the quantity <i>PE</i>
          defined in Equ.(10) is C &times; J/C = J. The joule (J)
          is the unit of energy. Thus, <i>PE</i> has the right
          units to be some kind of energy. The next two comments
          will make it clear that <i>PE</i> is indeed a potential
          energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 5</u>. By multiplying Equs.(6), (8), and (9)
          on both sides by <i>q</i> one obtains analogous equations
          relating the force <img src="../elpotimages/F.gif"
             alt="vector F" align="bottom"> exerted on the charged
             particle to the potential energy <i>PE</i> of the
             paricle in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, the magnitude <i>F</i> of the force is given by
        </p>

          For a uniform field, the limit in Equ.(12) is not
          necessary and one can calculate <i>F</i> from "<i>F</i> =
          |<font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i>| / <i>d</i>" = for
          finite <i>d</i>. This equation can be inverted to give

          This is precisely the standard definition of a potential
          energy. First of all, one defines potential energy in terms
          of its <b>change</b>, <font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i>;
          one does not directly define the potential energy <i>PE</i>
          itself. This leaves an additive constant in the potential
          energy undetermined that one is free to choose any way that
          is convenient. Second, if a potential energy can be
          associated with a force field (possible for special force
          fields only that are called
          <i>conservative</i>), then it is the negative of the work
          done by the force that is equated with the change in the
          potential energy. The reason why one uses the
          <b>negative</b> of the work in the definition of
          potential energy will be made clear in the following
          comment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 6</u>. By the work-kinetic energy theorem, the
          work <i>W</i> done on the particle by the electric field
          is equal to the change <font face=
          "symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> in the particle's kinetic
          energy as the particle moves from P to P',
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <i>W</i> = <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> =

             width="40">(16)
        </p>
        <p>
          Substituting Expression (16) for <i>W</i> into Equ.(15)
          gives
        </p>
        <p align="center">

        </p>
        <p>
          In words, if the test particle in moving from P to P'
          gains an amount <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> of
          kinetic energy, then its potential energy changes by an
          amount equal to -<font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>,
          i.e., it decreases by an equal amount.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is exactly the concept of potential energy. A
          particle has potential energy that can be converted into
          kinetic energy. If the kinetic energy increases by, say,
          5 J, the potential energy decreases by 5 J. Energy gets
          <b>converted</b> from potential to kinetic energy, and
          energy is neither created or destroyed. Energy
          conservation in this process can be exhibited more
          directly as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <i>E</i> denote the sum of kinetic and potential
          energy,

        <p align="center">

        <p>
          The quantity <i>E</i> is called the <i>energy of the
          particle in the electric field</i>. The change
             <font face="symbol">D</font><i>E</i> in the energy as
             the particle moves from P to P' can be found by moving
             <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> in Equ.(17) from
             the right-hand side to the left-hand side. Thus,

      marker. With the marker, the (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)-coordinates
      of the point and the electric potential <i>V</i> at that

    <p>
      Drag the field point, and observe how the field line and

      equipotential lines in your Notebook.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The electric field lines should be parallel to
      the electric field vector, i.e., paralell to the
      <i>y</i>-axis and the equipotential lines should be
      perpendicular to the field lines, i.e., parallel to the
      <i>x</i>-axis. An example of such a line pattern is shown in
      Figure 2 below.

      <b>Question 1</b>. The applet assumes that the value 0 V has
      been chosen for the electric potential <i>V</i> at the origin
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 0) m. What is the value of <i>V</i>
      directly above the origin at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 100)
      m? Calculate the value using the theory under "Definition of
      Electric Potential and Equipotential Lines".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The point P' at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 100)
      m is on the same electric field line as the origin and, seen
      from the origin, is in the direction of the electric field
      vector. Therefore, the direction from the origin to the point
      P' is the direction of most rapid decrease of the electric
      potential. This means we can use Equ.(8) to calculate the
      potential at P'. (P is the origin in this case.) Thus,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>V</i>(P') = <i>V</i>(P) - <i>Ed</i> = 0 - 40&times;100 =

    </p>
    <p>
      Confirm this value with the applet by moving the particle to
      point P'. Make sure the Coordinates button is deselected before
      you try to move the particle. The value of <i>V</i> at the
      location of the particle is displayed in the Data box. Also
      observe the length of the <i>V</i>-column in the Energy box as
      you move the particle to P'.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Question 1, with the
      particle at point P' with coordinates (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) =
      (0, 100) m, change the charge of the particle from <i>q</i> =
      2 C to <i>q</i> = -2 C. Observe the value of <i>V</i>
      displayed in the Data box and the length of the
      <i>V</i>-column in the Energy box. Explain your observations
      in terms of basic theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Neither the electric field nor the electric
      potential depend in any way on the properties of the test
      particle. They characterize the state of space without the
      test particle. Therefore, changing the charge of the test
      particle has no effect on the value of the electric potential
      at the particle's location.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, reverse the
      electric field from <img src="../elpotimages/E.gif" alt=

      "../elpotimages/E.gif" alt="vector E" align="bottom"> = (0,
      -40) V/m. Observe the value of <i>V</i> in the Data box and
      the length of the <i>V</i>-column in the Energy box, and
      explain your observations in terms of basic theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. With the electric field pointing downward,
      point P' at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 100) m when seen from
      the origin lies in the direction opposite to that of the
      electric field, and therefore in the direction of most rapid
      <b>increase</b> of the electric potential. Thus, in the
      calculation in Equ.(22) the minus sign on the right-hand side
      must be replaced by a plus sign. Thus, <i>V</i>(P') is now
      equal to +4,000 V.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. RESET the applet. Display the field lines
      and equipotential lines through the points
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 100) m and (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) =
      (0, 200) m. To set a field point marker at these points, it
      helps to display the grid. At the end, hide the grid again.

    <p>
      Deselect the Coordinates button, move the particle to
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 100) m, and hide the velocity
      vector. Figure 3 below illustrates what you should see.

      Hold down the SHIFT key, and drag the particle horizontally
      along the equipotential line at <i>y</i> = 100 m. Observe the
      value of the potential <i>V</i> in the Data box and the
      length of the <i>V</i>-column in the Energy box. Explain your
      observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. There should be no change in <i>V</i> since
      you are moving the particle along an equipotential line.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Continuing from Exercise 4, return the
      particle to (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 100) m. This time, drag
      it a fixed distance <i>d</i>, equal to the spacing between
      the two equipotential lines in Figure 3, but in different
      directions. Observe the change in electric potential in each
      direction, and explain your observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Since you are going to have to judge the
      distance <i>d</i> by eye through which you move the particle,
      the observations will be somewhat qualitative. However, you
      should be able to observe roughly that the largest decrease
      of <i>V</i> occurs when you move the particle upward along
      the electric field line to (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 200) m.
      The electric potential field is constructed so that the most
      rapid decrease of the electric potential is in the direction
      of the electric field.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. What is the potential change
         <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> when you move the
         particle from a point P with coordinates
         (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 100) m to a point P' with
         coordinates (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (200, 200) m, given that
         (<i>E<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>E<sub>y</sub></i>) = (0, 40) V?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. In going from P to the point straight above P
      at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 200) m, one moves in the
      direction of the electric field so that a calculation
      analogous to that in Equ.(22) applies. There is no further
      potential change in going from (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 200)
      m to (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (200, 100) m because this stretch
      is along an equipotential line. Therefore,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> = -<i>Ed</i> =
      -40&times;1000 = -4,000 V .<img src=
      "../elpotimages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "40">(23)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, <i>d</i> = 100 m is the distance from P to the point
      directly above P at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 200) m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding this potential change to the potential at P, which is
      -4,000 V, gives -8,000 V as the potential at P'. You can
      check this value with the applet.

      In your Notebook, describe the changes you observe in the
      particle's potential energy <i>PE</i>, kinetic energy
      <i>KE</i>, and total energy <i>E</i> as you step through the
      motion. Discuss if the changes are what you expect from basic
      theory. Also describe the change in the electric potential
      <i>V</i> at the particle's position as you step through the
      motion, and explain it in terms of basic theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The potential <i>V</i> decreases as the motion
      proceeds because the particle moves both in the direction of
      the electric field and "sideways". The "sideways" motion,
      i.e., the <i>x</i>-component of the motion, takes the
      particle to points of equal potential because it is
      perpendicular to the direction of the electric field.
      However, the <i>y</i>-component of the motion, which is in
      the direction of the electric field, takes the particle to
      points of lower electric potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the particle's charge is positive, Definition (10)
      implies that the particle's potential energy behaves like the
      potential: it decreases as the motion proceeds. Since the
      total energy is conserved, the kinetic energy must increase
      by as much as the potential energy increases. The particle
      gets faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. Given that the potential at the starting
      point of the motion, at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 100) m, is
      equal to -4,000 V, what is the particle's potential energy
      <i>PE</i> at this point? The particle's charge is equal to 2
      C.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Definition (10) of the potential energy,
      "<i>PE</i> = <i>qV</i>", gives the value <i>PE</i> =
      2&times;(-4,000) = -8,000 J. Click REPLAY to check this
      against the value in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. Continuing from Question 1, click REPLAY
      if you have not already done so and change the charge from
      <i>q</i> = 2 C to <i>q</i> = -2 C. What are the values of the
      electric potential at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, 100) m and of
      the particle's potential energy at this point now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The electric potential is still equal to
      -4,000 V. Its value does not depend on any particle
      properties. However, the particle's potential energy has
      changed to 8,000 J, in accordance with Equ.(10).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Question 2, with <i>q</i>
      = -2 C, STEP through the motion four times until you are at
      time <i>t</i> = 1.20 s. What does the trajectory look like
      this time?
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the changes of the same quantities as in Exercise 1
      and record in your Notebook if there are any differences
      compared to what you observed in Exercise 1. Explain the
      differences in terms of basic theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The trajectory is now a downward curving
      parabola. The electric potential is increasing along the
      trajectory because the component of the motion along the
      electric field direction is <b>opposite</b> to the direction
      of the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential energy, however, is decreasing as it did for
      positive charge in Exercise 1, because a negative charge
      combined with an increasing potential gives a decreasing
      potential energy, according to Equ.(10). Also, a particle
      starting from rest can only have its kinetic energy
      increasing and therefore must have its potential decreasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 3</b>. RESET the applet.

      <u>Electric Potential <i>V</i></u>
    </p>
    <p>
      As the answer to Question 2 at the end of the preceding
      section "Electric Potential and Equipotential Lines" shows,
      to evaluate the change in potential <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>V</i> in going from P to P', we need to
      consider only the component of the particle's displacement in
      the direction of the electric field, i.e., the
      <i>y</i>-component <i>d<sub>y</sub></i> = 19.2 m of the
      particle's displacement from P to P'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the electric field points from the equipotential line
      through P to that through P', the minus sign in Equ.(8) is
      appropriate and we get
    </p>

      Adding this to the electric potential at P gives the

    </p>
    <p>
      The Data box shows a value of -4,767 V, which differs by 1 V
      from the value calculated here. This discrepancy is the
      result of round-off in the displayed value of
      <i>d<sub>y</sub></i>. Suppose <i>d<sub>y</sub></i> were
      really equal to 19.15 m, a value that is consistent within
      round-off with the displayed value of 19.2 m, the preceding
      calculation would have given <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>V</i> = -40&times;19.15 = -766 V and
      <i>V</i>(P') = -4,766 V. This value also differs by 1 V from

      direction.

    <p>
      <u>Potential Energy <i>PE</i></u>
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Definition (10) of the potential energy, we only

      <i>q</i> to get the potential energy of the particle at P',

    <p>
      This value differs by 1 J from that shown in the Data box.

      Again, the difference of 1 J between this value and the one
      displayed for <i>E</i> at point P' in the Data box is the
      result of the same kind of round-off error mentioned before.

      The kinetic energy at P' can be obtained by subtracting from
      the total energy the potential energy at P',

      <i>KE</i>(P') = <i>E</i> - <i>PE</i>(P') = 7,000 - (-9,536) =
      16,536 J. <img src="../elpotimages/small.gif" alt="space"

      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Do more calculations analogous to those
      done in Question 3, by evaluating <i>V</i>, <i>PE</i>,
      <i>E</i>, and <i>KE</i> at some other point P' on the
      particle's trajectory and for points P' on other trajectories
      corresponding to other values of the particle's charge and
      mass and other values of the electric field.
