      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This page is designed to get you started using the applet.
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on
      this page are to be done in the applet. You may need to
      toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if your
      screen space is limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is assumed that you are familiar with the functionality of
      the applet as explained in Help.

      The goal is to arrange all applet settings so that they are
      as shown in Figure 1 below.

      Click the Reset button <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset"

    </p>
    <p>
      Click on the <i>y</i>-axis (observation screen) and drag it
      until the width <i>L</i> of the capacitor plates is equal to
      215.0 cm. The value of <i>L</i> is displayed in the Data box.
      Verify this value by measuring it with the Ruler. For
      operation of the Ruler, see Number 7 in Help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the horizontal separation <i>D</i> between the
      observation screen and the right edge of the capacitor plates
      (right edge of the field region) has a value equal to 150.0
      cm that is fixed by the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set the initial speed, electric and magnetic fields, mass and
      charge of the particle to the values indicated on the sliders
      in Figure 1 above.

      Hiding the Variables
    </div>
    <p>
      If you are an instructor, you may want to hide the settings of
      <i>v</i>, <i>m</i>, and <i>q</i> from view in order to simulate
      a realistic laboratory situation. Do this by clicking the Hide
      Values button <img src="HideValues.gif" alt="Hide Variables"
      align="top">. The remaining controls will be sufficient to allow
      determination of the speed and of the ratio
      <i>q</i>/<i>m</i>. See Lesson for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will not be possible to retrieve the values of <i>v</i>,
      <i>m</i>, and <i>q</i>. Thus, make sure you note them down
      somewhere before clicking Hide Values. This is not a toggle
      button. Resetting the applet will restore the functionality
      of all sliders, but will not yield the former slider
      settings. Neither will the Replay button.
    </p>
    <p>
      After clicking Hide Values, click Replay and observe what
      happens.

      When the settings are as displayed in Figure 1, click Play

    </p>
    <p>
      Display the particle's path by selecting the Trace toggle
      button <img src="Trace.gif" alt="Particle Path" align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particle should be moving along a curved blue path like
      that shown in Figure 2 below, reaching a vertical deflection
      <i>y</i> = 16.3 cm at the observation screen. This value is
      displayed in the Data box. You should also be able to measure
      <i>y</i> approximately with the ruler.

      Reset the applet, and make the following changes and
      observations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <u>E-slider</u>. Vary the setting of the slider from -500
        V/m to 500 V/m. Observe the charges on the capacitor plates
        and the corresponding field direction as indicated by the
        small green arrows. Observe the display when the field is
        zero. Remember that you can make small adjustments in all
        slider settings by clicking in the slider groove to the
        left or to the right of the slider tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>B-slider</u>. Vary the setting of the slider from -5.00
        T to 5.00 T. Observe the changes in the field direction as
        indicated by the small orange circles or x's. Observe the
        display when the field is zero.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Charge-slider</u>. Vary the setting of the slider from
        -3.00 C to 3.00 C. Observe the change in the color of the
        particle as the charge goes from negative to zero to
        positive.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Velocity vector</u>. Click the velocity vector button so
        that the vector is displayed. Vary the setting of the
        <i>v</i>-slider and observe the corresponding change in
        magnitude of the velocity vector. Play the motion, and
        observe the velocity during the motion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Trajectory</u>. With the Trace button selected so that
        the particle path will be displayed, run the motion for
        various conditions of initial speed, field strengths,
        charge, and mass. You should be able to observe that the
        path is curved only between the capacitor plates and that
        it is straight outside of these plates.
      </li>
    </ul>
