<div class="title">Assumptions - Thomson's Charge/Mass Measurement</div>

     <p><div class="sectionheading">The applet simulates the deflection of
     a charged particle upon passing through perpendicular electric
     and magnetic fields and allows determination of the charge/mass
     ratio by varying the fields and observing the corresponding
     deflections.</div>

    <p>The applet assumes that the particle is subject only to
    electric and magnetic forces.  The gravitational force is not
    included.

	 <p>The applet assumes that the electric and magnetic fields
	 are uniform and non-zero between the capacitor plates and
	 that both fields are zero everywhere else.  In reality, a
	 capacitor with plates of finite size will not produce an
	 electric field that is exactly uniform between the plates and
	 exactly zero everywhere else.  Neither is it possible to
	 produce a magnetic field like this. Thus, realistic fields
	 will be different from those assumed here, but the errors
	 introduced by assuming the given fields are slight.
	 Moreover, all standard textbooks use the same kinds of
	 idealized fields.
