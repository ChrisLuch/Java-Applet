<div class="title">Lesson - Particle in Magnetic Field</div>

<p><div class="sectionheading">The applet simulates the motion of a
charged particle in a uniform magnetic field.</div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p><b>Prerequisites</b>

<p>Students should be familiar with the concepts of magnetic field,
charge, and force, and be familiar with acceleration in uniform
circular motion (centripetal acceleration) and Newton's second law of
motion.

<p><b>Learning Outcomes</b>

<p>Students will develop an understanding of the force (magnitude and
direction) exerted by a magnetic field on a charged particle and of
how this force affects the motion of the particle.  They will learn
that the motion is circular if the field is uniform and if the
particle's velocity is at right angles to the field.  They will learn
to calculate the radius and period of the circular orbit and will gain
additional experience in using Newton's second law of motion and the
kinematics of uniform circular motion.

<p><b>Instructions</b>

<p>Students should know how the applet functions, as described in Help and
ShowMe.

<p>The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in the
following text are to be done in the applet. You may need to toggle
back and forth between instructions and applet if your screen space is
limited.

  <p><b>Question</b>.  On what physical quantities does the force
  exerted on a particle in a magnetic field depend, and how does it
  depend on these quantities?  

  <p>We must expect this dependence to be different from that for the
  force on a particle in an electric field.  Otherwise there would be
  nothing to distinguish the two kinds of fields.

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  Let us try to find the answer "experimentally" by
  using the applet. Let's investigate a possible dependence of the
  force on the following quantities: 

<ul>
  <p><li>mass <i>m</i> of the particle,<li>
  
  <li>charge <i>q</i> of the particle,</li> 

  <li>velocity <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> of the particle,</li>

  <li>magnetic field <img src="B.gif" align="bottom">.</li>  

  </ul>

  <p>We need to vary all four quantities and see how the force changes
  as a result.

  <p>One quantity is left out in the list above: the particle's
  position.  The reason is as follows.  The force should not
  explicitly depend on the position of the particle because space is
  assumed to be the same everywhere.  Implicitly, the force could
  depend on position if the magnetic field vector were different at
  different points in space.  However, such dependence on position
  <b>through</b> the magnetic field is taken care of by studying the
  dependence of the force on the magnetic field vector <img
  src="B.gif" align="bottom">.

  <p>Note that the applet assumes that the magnetic field is uniform
  and that there is no gravitational force acting on the particle.


 <ol>

  <p><li>Reset <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet. 

    <p>Make the following settings:

    <p><ul>

    <li> <i>m</i>: 1.0 kg</li>

    <li> <i>v</i>: 150 m/s</li>

    <li> <i>q</i>: 1.0 C</li>

    <li><img src="B.gif" align="bottom">: magnitude 2.0 T, direction out
    of screen</li>

    </ul>

	 <p>Click Play <img src="Play.gif" alt="Play" align="top">, and Pause <img
    src="Pause.gif" align="top"> the particle's motion at the point
    shown in Figure 1 below.  It does not matter if you stop the
    particle at a slightly different point.  Display the velocity
    vector (magenta).

	 <p align="center"><img src="BAppletforcedirection.gif"></p>

    <p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

	 <p>You should be able to observe that the particle moves in a
	 circular orbit and that it manintains a constant speed in doing
	 so.  These are just eye-balling observations, but in a laboratory
	 one could confirm these observations by real measurements.  The
	 applet gives a value of 75.0 m (the unit "m" is not indicated)
	 for the radius <i>r</i> of the orbit.

	 <p>How can we use these observations to find out about the force
	 exerted on the particle by the magnetic field?</li>

	 <p><li><u>Direction of the Force</u>. The direction of the force
	 when the particle is at the left-most point in the circle is
	 indicated by the black arrow in Figure 1.  (The arrow is not shown
	 by the applet.) The force is to the right, at right angles to the
	 velocity.  How do we know that?

	 <p>We know from kinematical studies of uniform circular motion
	 that the acceleration in such motion is in the direction from the
	 particle towards the center of the circle, at any given moment.
	 One says the acceleration is "centripetal", a word derived from
	 Latin meaning "center-seeking".

	 <p>By Newton's second law, the net force is in the same direction
	 as the acceleration.  Therefore the net force too must be in the
	 direction from the particle to the center of the circle.  In the
	 applet, there is only one force acting on the particle: the force
	 exerted by the magnetic field.  Therefore the magnetic force is
	 equal to the net force and therefore directed from the particle
	 towards the center of the circle, which is in the direction of the
	 black arrow in Figure 1.

	 <p>Click Play again and Pause at another point in the orbit.  Think
	 about the direction of the force in relation to that of the
	 velocity at that point.  The force will again be perpendicular to
	 the velocity.

	 <p>This is quite different from the situation of a charged
	 particle moving in an electric field.  Does the force in that case
	 have any relationship to the particle's velocity? No, the force is
	 always in the direction of the electric field (if the charge is
	 positive), no matter what the velocity is.

	 <p>What about the direction of the force in relation to that of
	 the magnetic field?  Is it in the direction of the magnetic field?
	 <b>No!</b> The magnetic field is perpendicular to the screen
	 towards the viewer while the force direction is in the screen at
	 all times while the particle is moving in its circle.  Thus, when
	 the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the direction
	 of the force is <b>perpendicular</b> to the magnetic field as
	 well.

	 <p><blockquote><b>Summary</b>. In the situation that we have
	 investigated, where a charged particle is moving at right angles
	 to a magnetic field, the force exerted on the particle by the
	 field is perpendicular to both the particle's velocity and the
	 field.</blockquote> 
	 
	 <blockquote>Although the applet does not let you investigate this, it is true
	  that the magnetic force is always perpendicular to both the particle's velocity and th
	  e magnetic field, no matter in what direction the particle is moving.</blockquote></li
	  >

	 <p>The preceding statement does not completely define the
	 direction of the force.  There is still an ambiguity because a
	 perpendicular has two directions.  This ambiguity is resolved by
	 the following right-hand rule.

	 <p><li><u>Right-Hand Rule</u>. The direction of the force exerted
	 on a particle moving in a magnetic field can be visualized by
	 means of the following right-hand rule.  (There are several
	 right-hand rules for this purpose.  Here, the following one is
	 suggested.)  The rule is illustrated in Figure 2 below.  Compare
	 the vectors in Figure 2 with those in Figure 1.

    <p align="center"><img src="thumbrule1.gif"></p>

    <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

	 <p>The force is normal (perpendicular) to the plane spanned by
      vectors <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> and <img src="B.gif"
      align="bottom">.

  <p> The only question is: "Along which normal is it?" There is one
      normal sticking out of one side of a plane and another normal
      sticking out on the other side. The right-hand rule illustrated
      in Figure 2 lets you decide which normal it is.

      <p>Hold your right hand flat with outstretched fingers in the
      direction of the velocity <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> and with
      the thumb pointing off to one side in a direction perpendicular
      to the plane spanned by <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> and
      <img src="B.gif" align="bottom">. There are two such directions
      in which the thumb could point.  Which is the right one?

      <p>The right direction for the thumb is the one in which your
      palm faces in the direction of vector <img src="B.gif"
      align="bottom">.  When you curl the fingers of your right hand,
      they should curl towards <img src="B.gif" align="bottom">. The
      thumb will then be pointing in the direction of the magnetic
      force <img src="F.gif" align="bottom">.

      <p>If your palm faces in the wrong direction, rotate your hand
      by 180<sup>o</sup> around the axis that points along the
      outstretched fingers.  E.g., if <img src="B.gif" align="bottom">
      were into the screen rather than out of the screen, with <img
      src="v.gif" align="bottom"> as in Figures 1 and 2, the palm
      would have to be turned by 180<sup>o</sup> to be facing in the
      direction of <img src="B.gif" align="bottom"> and the thumb and
      the force <img src="F.gif" align="bottom"> would be to the left
      rather than to the right.

		<p><b>Exercise 1</b>.  Draw a vector <img src="v.gif"
      align="bottom"> and a vector <img src="B.gif" align="bottom"> on
      a sheet of paper, and hold the paper at some angle.  Use the
      right-hand rule to find the direction of the magnetic force.
      Hint: The force is perpendicular to the plane of the paper.

	 <p><b>Note</b>. In a separate Advanced Lesson titled "Vector
	 Equation for the Magnetic Force" you will find an explanation of
	 how to represent the magnetic force as a vector product.  The
	 vector product allows a general description of the magnetic force,
	 of its direction and magnitude, that covers all cases.

	 <p><li><u>Magnitude of the Force</u>.  To be able to determine how
	 the magnitude of the force depends on the four quantities listed
	 earlier, we need to have a way of measuring the force.  Newton's
	 second law provides such a way.  This law implies for the
	 magnitude <i>F</i> of the magnetic force the equation (remember
	 that the magnetic force is the total force here)

	 <p align="center"><i>F</i> = <i>m a</i>. <img src="small.gif"
	 height="1" width="40"> (1)

	 <p>In uniform circular motion, the magnitude <i>a</i> of the
	 acceleration is equal to

    <p align="center"><i>a</i> = <i>v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>r</i> <img
    src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (2)

	 <p>where <i>r</i> is the radius of the circular orbit and <i>v</i>
	 the particle's constant speed.  Substituting Expression (2) into
	 Equation (1) gives us the following measure of the magnitude of
	 the magnetic force:

    <p align="center"><i>F</i> = <i>m v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>r</i>. <img
    src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (3)

	 <p>The applet displays the value of <i>r</i>.  In the laboratory,
	 we would be able to measure <i>r</i>. The values of <i>m</i> and
	 <i>v</i> are set by us.  So we can measure <i>F</i> by determining
	 the value of the right-hand side of Equation (3).

	 <p>For the setting used so far,

    <p><ul>

    <li> <i>m</i>: 1.0 kg</li>

    <li> <i>v</i>: 150 m/s</li>

    <li> <i>q</i>: 1.0</li>

    <li><img src="B.gif" align="bottom">: magnitude 2.0 T, direction out
    of screen,</li>

    </ul>

	 <p>the Data Box gives <i>r</i> = 75.0 m (the unit "m" is not displayed)
	 which, via Equation (3), implies

    <p align="center"><i>F</i> = <i>m v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>r</i> = 1.0
    x 150<sup>2</sup>/75.0 = 300 N. <img src="small.gif" height="1"
    width="40"> (4)

  <ul>

	 <p><li><u>Dependence on Mass</u>.  Rewind the applet, and set <i>m</i> = 2 kg
	 .  Make no other changes.  The Data Box should give <i>r</i> = 150 m.  If
	 you play the motion, you will indeed find the orbit to be twice as
	 large.  Substituting the new values into Expression (3) for
	 <i>F</i> gives

    <p align="center"><i>F</i> = <i>m v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>r</i> = 2.0
    x 150<sup>2</sup>/150.0 = 300 N. <img src="small.gif" height="1"
    width="40"> (5)

	 <p><i>F</i> is the same as before!  The force does not depend on the
	 mass.</li>

	 <p><li><u>Dependence on Speed</u>. Rewind the applet, set the mass back
	 to 1.0 kg and double the speed to 300 m/s.  The Data Box should give
	 <i>r</i> = 300 m.  Play the motion to verify that you get the same
	 double-size circle as last time.  What do you get for <i>F</i> this
	 time?

    <p align="center"><i>F</i> = <i>m v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>r</i> = 1.0
    x 300<sup>2</sup>/150.0 = 600 N. <img src="small.gif" height="1"
    width="40"> (6)

	 <p><i>F</i> = 600 N is twice the value found in calculation (4).
	 Thus, doubling the speed doubles the magnitude of the force. Let's
	 guess that the magnitude of the force is proportional to the
	 speed.  You may want to verify this by measuring <i>F</i> for
	 different values of the speed.</li>

	 <p><li><u>Dependence on Charge and on the Magnitude of the
	 Field</u>.  Analogously to the preceding two determinations, vary
	 the charge or the magnitude of the field to determine how the
	 force depends on these quantities.  You should find
	 proportionality of <i>F</i> with <i>q</i> and <i>B</i> as well.
	 
	 <p>Thus, one obtains the result

	 <p align="center"><i>F</i> = |<i>q</i>| <i>v B</i> <img
    src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> if <img src="small.gif"
    height="1" width="20"> <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> <img
    src="perpendicular.gif" align="bottom"> <img src="B.gif"
    align="bottom"> . <img
    src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (7)

	 <p><u>Comment 1</u>. One must take the absolute value |<i>q</i>| of the charge
	 in this equation because <i>q</i> can be negative while <i>F</i>
	 is positive by definition.

	 <p><u>Comment 2</u>.  The SI-unit of the magnetic field, the tesla
	 (T), is chosen so that the proportionality constant in Equation
	 (7) is 1.  The size of the tesla is defined by Equation (7).

	 <p><b>Exercise 2</b>. Rewind the applet.  Use the Magnetic Field Direction toggle
	 button to set the magnetic field direction so that it is in the
	 screen and to the right.  Then Play the motion.  What kind of
	 motion do you observe?  What magnetic force is exerted on the
	 particle in this case?  Contrast your observation with what you
	 know to be true when a charged particle is moving in an
	 <b>electric</b> field.

	 <p>You should find

	 <p align="center"><i>F</i> = 0 <img src="small.gif" height="1"
    width="20"> if <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> <img
    src="v.gif" align="bottom"> || <img src="B.gif" align="bottom">.
    <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (8)</li>

  </ul></li>

    <div class="sectionheading"><a name="Calculations"
    align="top">Calculating the Radius and the Period</a></div>

	 <p>Make the following settings:

	 <p><ul>

	 <li> <i>m</i>: 1.0 kg</li>

	 <li> <i>v</i>: 150 m/s</li>

	 <li> <i>q</i>: 2.0 C</li>

	 <li><img src="B.gif" align="bottom">: magnitude 2.0 T, direction out
	 of screen</li>

	 </ul>

	 <p>The Data Box shows for the radius <i>r</i> of the circular
    orbit and the period <i>T</i> the values reproduced in Figure 3
    below.

    <p align="center"><img src="Bdata.gif"></p>

    <p align="center"><b>Figure 3</b></p>

	 <p><b>Question 1</b>.  How would you calculate the radius
	 <i>r</i>?

	 <p><b>Answer</b>. When expression (7) for <i>F</i> is substituted
	 into Equation (3), one obtains the following equation involving
	 <i>r</i>:

	 <p align="center">|<i>q</i>| <i>v B</i> = <i>m
	 v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>r</i> . <img src="small.gif" height="1"
	 width="40"> (9)

	 <p>One factor of <i>v</i> can be cancelled on both sides.  Solving
	 the resulting equation for <i>r</i> gives

	 <p align="center"><i>r</i> = <i>mv</i>/(|<i>q</i>|<i>B</i>) . <img
    src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (10)

	 <p>You should be able to confirm by substituting the given values
	 into Expression (10) that <i>r</i> = 37.5 m.  Thus, the Data Box
	 displays the value of the radius in SI-units.

	 <p><b>Note</b>.  The sliders for <i>m</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>q</i>, and
	 <i>B</i> in the applet are arranged in the same order in which
	 they appear in Expression (10) for <i>r</i>.

	 <p><b>Question 2</b>.  How would you calculate the period of the
	 motion?

	 <p><b>Answer</b>.  The distance <i>s</i> traveled during one
	 period <i>T</i> is equal to the circumference of the circle, which
	 is equal to 2&pi; <i>r</i>.  Since the speed <i>v</i> is constant in this motion and therefore equal to
	  the average speed, we can write

	 <p align="center"><i>v</i> = (distance traveled)/(time elapsed) =
    2&pi; <i>r</i>/<i>T</i> . <img
    src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (11)</p>

	 <p>Substituting Expression (10) for <i>r</i> into Equation (11)
	 gives

	 <p align="center"><i>v</i> = 2&pi;
	 <i>mv</i>/(|<i>q</i>|<i>BT</i>). <img src="small.gif" height="1"
	 width="40"> (12)</p>

	 <p>Canceling the factor <i>v</i> on both sides and solving the
	 resulting equation for <i>T</i> gives

	 <p align="center"><i>T</i> = 2&pi;
	 <i>m</i>/(|<i>q</i>|<i>B</i>). <img src="small.gif" height="1"
	 width="40"> (13)

	 <p>Substituting the given values gives

	 <p align="center"><i>T</i> = 2&pi; x
    1/(2x2) = 2&pi; x 0.25 .<img
    src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (14)

	 <p>The Data Box displays as the value of <i>T</i> only the factor
    0.25.  The factor 2&pi; is omitted.  All quantities in the applet
    other than the period may be interpreted as expressed in
    SI-units. However, the value of <i>T</i> in the Data Box cannot be
    interpreted in seconds, because of the omission of the factor
    2&pi;.  The factor is omitted to be able to present simpler values
    for <i>T</i>.  Thus, to obtain the value for the period in
    seconds, take the value displayed in the Data Box and multiply it
    by 2&pi;.

	 <p><b>Observation</b>.  Equation (13) for the period does not
	 involve the speed of the particle.  As long as the mass and charge
	 of the particle are held fixed, which they would be for a given
	 kind of naturally occuring particle, then all particles of this
	 kind complete their circular orbits with the same period no matter
	 what speed they have, as long as the magnetic field stays the
	 same.

	 <p>Verify this with the applet by varying <i>v</i> while keeping
	 all other settings fixed.

	 <p>This fact was crucial for the development of the cyclotron in
	 the early 1930's, a machine used to accelerate protons.  In a
	 cyclotron, the protons are moving in orbits at right angles to a
	 uniform magnetic field.  Twice in every orbit they receive a kick
	 by traversing a gap containing an electric field.  As the protons
	 are getting faster, their periods do not change.  This makes it
	 possible to accelerate them at constant time intervals, which was
	 a technical necessity at the time.
