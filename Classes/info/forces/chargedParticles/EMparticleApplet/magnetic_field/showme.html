<p><b>Instructions</b>

<p>This page is designed to get you started using the applet. The
applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on this page are
to be done in the applet. You may need to toggle back and forth
between instructions and applet if your screen space is
limited.

Parameters That Determine the Particle's Orbit</div></a>

  <p>The motion of a particle in a magnetic field depends on the
  magnetic field <img src="B.gif" align="bottom">, the initial
  velocity <img src="v.gif" align="bottom">(0) of the particle, and
  the charge <i>q</i> and mass <i>m</i> of the particle.  It will now
  be explained how you can vary these parameters and this way vary the
  particle's motion.

  <p>All parameter values are entered in SI-units.  The units are not specified in the entry fields.
   For more comments on units, please see the section <a href="#Data">Data</a> below.

 <ol>

  <p><li>Reset <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet. The
  magenta velocity vector should be visible.  You can hide or display
  it by means of the Velocity toggle button <img src="VelocityVector.gif"
  alt="Velocity vector" align="top">.  For the time being, keep it displayed.</li>

  <p><li><u>Initial Position and Velocity</u>. If the magnetic field
  is uniform, as it is in the applet, the initial position has no
  influence on the particle's motion, other than where the motion will
  occur.  Therefore, and in order to make best use of the available
  space when displaying the orbits, the applet does not let you vary
  the particle's initial position.  The particle will always start out
  at the center of the applet window.

  <p>Important for the nature of the motion is the direction of the
  initial velocity <b>relative to</b> the direction of the magnetic
  field.  In the applet the initial velocity is fixed to be horizontal
  and to the right, i.e., in the positive <i>x</i>-direction, but the
  direction of the magnetic field can be varied to some extent.  It is
  not necessary to vary the directions of both the velocity and the
  field to be able to observe the range of possible motions.</li>

  <p><li><u>Initial Speed</u>. Set the initial speed <i>v</i> to 150 m/s
  with the Speed slider <img src="Bspeed.gif" alt="speed" align="top">.

  <p>Note that the speed cannot be adjusted by dragging the tip of the velocity
  vector.</li>

  <p><li><u>Mass</u>.  Set the mass of the particle to 1.0 kg with the
  Mass slider <img src="Bmass.gif" alt="mass" align="top">.</li>

  <p><li><u>Charge</u>.  Set the charge of the particle to 2.0 C with
  the Charge slider <img src="Bcharge.gif" alt="charge" align="top">.</li>

  <p><li><u>Magnetic Field</u>.  Set the magnitude <i>B</i> of the
  magnetic field to 2.0 T with the Magnetic-Field slider <img
  src="Bmagnitude.gif" alt="magnitude of magnetic field" align="top">.

  <p>Set the direction of the magnetic field to out-of-screen with the
    Magnetic Field Direction toggle button <img src="Bdirection.gif" align="top">.

  <p>You should obtain the display shown in Figure 1 below.  The
    small circles indicate that the magnetic field is pointing towards
    the viewer.  Think of the little circles as tips of arrows
    pointing towards you.  To display the orbit (shown in blue in
    Figure 1), click Play <img src="Play.gif" alt="Play" align="top"> and the
    Trace toggle button <img src="Trace.gif" alt="Trace" align="top">.

    <p align="center"><img src="Bpath.jpg"></p></li>

	 <p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p></li>

  </ol>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<p>
  <a name="Motion"><div class="sectionheading">Observing the
  Motion</div></a>

  <ol>

    <p><li>With the settings made above, click Play <img src="Play.gif"
    alt="Play" align="top">. Display the particle's track by selecting the Trace
    toggle button <img src="Trace.gif" alt="Trace" align="top">.  You should be
    able to observe the particle moving along a circular path curving
    to the right, like that shown in Figure 1.</li>

	 <p><li>Click Rewind <img src="Rewind.gif" align="top">, and reverse
	 the charge to -2.0 C without changing any of the other settings.
	 Then click Play again.  You should be able to observe a circular
	 orbit exactly like that in Figure 1, but this time curving to the
	 left.</li>

    <p><li>Click Rewind, change the charge back to +2.0 C, but this time
    set the magnetic field direction to "into screen" by clicking the
    Magnetic Field Direction toggle button <img src="Bdirection.gif" align="top">
    once. Little "x's" throughout the applet window indicate the field
    direction.  You can think of the "x's" as tail ends of arrows
    viewed from behind.

	 <p>If you don't change any of the other settings, the motion
	 should be just like the previous one, the same size circle as in
	 Figure 1 but curving to the left.</li>

    <p><li>Click Rewind once more, change the charge again to -2.0 C,
    but make no other changes. The magnetic field direction is still
    into the screen. The motion should be exactly as in Figure 1.</li>

	 <p><li>Finally, click Rewind and click the Magnetic Field direction button again so
	 that it reads "to the right".  Throughout the applet window
	 little arrows pointing right indicate that the magnetic field is
	 to the right everywhere.  When you play the motion, you should be
	 able to observe a constant-velocity motion to the right.</li>

	 <p><li>You can step through any motion by clicking the Step button
    <img src="Step.gif" alt="Step" align="top">.  The step size cannot be
    varied.</li>

align="top"></a></p>

    <p>

    <div class="sectionheading"><a name="Data"
    align="top">Data</a></div>

	 <p>Set the applet to the settings made initially:

	 <p><ul>

	 <li> <i>m</i>: 1.0 kg</li>

	 <li> <i>v</i>: 150 m/s</li>

	 <li> <i>q</i>: 2.0 C</li>

	 <li><img src="B.gif" align="bottom">: magnitude 2.0 T, direction out
	 of screen</li>

	 </ul>

	 <p>In the Data Box in the top right corner of the applet, observe
    the values of the radius <i>r</i> of the circular orbit and the
    period <i>T</i> with which the particle moves through the circle.
    The Data Box is shown in Figure 2 below.

    <p align="center"><img src="Bdata.gif"></p>

    <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

	 <p>The radius and period are displayed without units, as are the
	 slider values.  The value of the radius <i>r</i> is in SI-units.  However, the value of the period is not.  To
	  obtain the value of the period in seconds, muliply the value given in the
    Data Box by 2&pi;.
	 
<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>


  <div class="sectionheading"><a name="Zoom">Zoom Slider</a></div>

    <p>Click Reset, and make the following settings in the applet:

    <p><ul>

    <li> <i>m</i>: 3.0 kg</li>

    <li> <i>v</i>: 150 m/s</li>

    <li> <i>q</i>:1.0 C</li>

    <li><img src="B.gif" align="bottom">: magnitude 1.0 T, direction out
    of screen</li>

    </ul>

	 <p>Play the motion.  You should find that the particle's orbit
	 goes way off screen.  If you wait long enough, the particle will
	 return to its starting point.

	 <p>To be able to see the entire orbit (most of it, anyway), as in Figure 3 below, click
  Rewind and set the Zoom slider to 1/6X.  

    <p align="center"><img src="Bzoomsixth.gif"></p>

    <p align="center"><b>Figure 3</b></p>

  <p>The Zoom may have to be set to a different value, depending
  on the size of your window.
