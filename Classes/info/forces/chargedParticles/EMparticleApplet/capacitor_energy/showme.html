      The applet simulates the conditions encountered by a charged
      particle between the plates of an infinitely extended
      parallal-plate capacitor.  The applet shows only the portion of
      the capacitor that fits inside the applet window.  See Figure 1
      below.  The two plates of the capacitor are charged uniformly
      with electric charge of opposite sign.  The electric field
      associated with these charges is uniform inside the capacitor
      and zero outside the capacitor.  The particle's motion is
      restricted to the region inside the capacitor.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src="Reset.gif" alt="RESET"
      align="top"> the applet to restore the applet's default
      settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the applet's default state, the Electric Field slider is at
      50 V/m, the green arrows indicating the direction of the
      electric field are pointing upward, and there are positive
      charges on the lower plate and negative charges on the upper
      plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Change the Electric Field slider setting from 50 V/m to 100
      V/m, and observe a proportional increase in the charge
      density on the plates (doubling of the charge density).
    </p>
    <p>
      Change the setting of the Electric Field slider to a negative
      value, say, -50 V/m, and observe reversal in the direction of
      the electric field and reversal in the signs of the charges
      on the upper and lower plates of the capacitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Adjust the Electric Field slider to -50
      V/m. The direction of the electric field as indicated by the
      green arrows will be downward. Display the Vector panel by
      selecting the Vectors button <img src="Vectors.gif" alt=
      "Vectors Button" align="top">, and select "Force" on the
      panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Charge slider is still at its default setting of 3 C,
      the electric force acting on the charged particle is
      downward. It is indicated by a black arrow pointing downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raise the setting of the Charge slider to 5 C, and observe a
      proportional increase in the length of the black arrow
      representing the force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Change the setting of the Charge slider to a negative value,
      say, -3 C, and observe reversal in the direction of the
      force. The force should point upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Data box by selecting the Data button
         <img src="Data.gif" alt="Data" align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, vary the particle's charge with the Charge slider, and
      observe the corresponding changes in the force components
      <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> displayed in
      the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Vary the setting of the Mass slider.
      Observe that the black force vector is not affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Vector panel, deselect "Force" and select
      "Acceleration" instead. The particle's acceleration vector is
      represented by an orange arrow. Again vary the particle's
      mass, and observe that the magnitude of the acceleration is
      <b>inversely</b> proportional to the mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Data box, and observe the changes in the
      acceleration components <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> and
      <i>a<sub>y</sub></i> as you vary the mass.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag the particle to (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (100,100) m.
      Display the Data box while dragging the particle in order to
      observe <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Hint</u>. You may want to hold the SHIFT key down while
      moving the particle to its exact position, to restrict the
      direction of motion to horizontal or vertical. Displaying the
      Grid while dragging may help also.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Set the particle's velocity to
      (<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) = (200, 0) m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do so, click on the mode selector button to the left of
      the velocity data fields until the Cartesian entry mode is
      selected. The button and the labels of the two fields should
      look as in Figure 2 below.

    <p>
      Display the velocity vector by selecting "Velocity" in the
      Vector panel. The velocity vector corresponding to the
      velocity value above is displayed by the applet as in Figure
      3 below.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Make sure the particle's initial position
      and velocity are still as in Exercises 1 and 2. Set the
      electric field and the particle's charge and mass to the
      values indicated in Figure 2. PLAY the motion. The particle
      should follow the trajectory shown in Figure 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. REWIND the applet. Keep all settings of
      the applet the same, except for the direction of the initial
      velocity. To change the direction, click on the mode
      selection button to the left of the velocity data fields
      until you reach the polar-positive mode, which is indicated
      by the icon <img src="posangle.gif" alt="polar-positive mode"
      align="top">. Change the velocity direction angle from 0 to
      20<sup>o</sup>. PLAY the motion. You should obtain a
      parabolic trajectory, first rising and then decending.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Display the force vector
      (in black) by checking "Force" on the Vector panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag the particle throughout the region between the two
      capacitor plates. Observe that the force vector remains
      unchanged in magnitude and direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vary the settings of the three sliders, and observe the force
      vector. The force is proportional to the electric field and
      the particle charge, but is independent of the particle mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. RESET the applet. Display the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make the following settings:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        electric field: <i>E</i> = 50 V/m
      </li>
      <li>
        particle elevation: <i>y</i> = 100 m
      </li>
      <li>
        particle velocity: speed <i>v</i> = 100 m/s, direction
        angle <font face="symbol">q</font> = 0
      </li>
      <li>
        particle charge: <i>q</i> = -1 C
      </li>
      <li>
        particle mass: <i>m</i> = 3.0 kg
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With these settings, the three energy columns in the Data box
      should look as in Figure 4 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="Capacitor_EnergyEnergies.gif" alt="Energy Columns">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 4</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. The blue middle column in the Energy box
      represents the particle's potential energy in the electric
      field. Move the particle upward, in the direction of the field,
      and observe that the potential energy increases. Move the
      particle downward, opposite to the field, and observe that the
      potential energy decreases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reverse the particle's charge from -1 C to 1 C, and observe
      that the value of the potential energy changes from positive
      to negative. The thin line across the three energy columns
      indicates the zero level of energy. According to the Data
      box, the potential energy changes from 5775 J to -5775 J.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reverse the electric field from 50 V/m to -50 V/m, and
      observe that the potential energy reverses its value again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vary the particle mass, and observe that this has no effect
      on the potential energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Restore the applet settings from Exercise
      2. Display the velocity vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vary the magnitude of the velocity by dragging the tip of the
      velocity vector. Observe the changes in the first energy
      column, which is entirely in red. It represents the
      particle's kinetic energy, which is proportional to the
      particle's speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make the particle speed so large that the kinetic energy
      column grows beyond the upper boundary of the Energy box.
      Then adjust the scale of all energy columns by dragging the
      zoom slider in the top left corner of the energy box
      downward. If you drag it down far enough, you should be able
      to reduce the size of the kinetic energy bar so that it fits
      entirely into the Energy box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Vary the settings of the three sliders,
      and observe the changes in the kinetic energy column. The
      column should grow in size in proportion to the mass, but be
      independent of the electric field and the charge of the
      particle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 6</b>. The third column in the Energy box is a
      composite of the blue potential energy and red kinetic energy
      columns. The total height of this column represents the total
      energy <i>E</i> of the particle in the electric field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make the same changes as before, i.e., change the position
      and speed of the charge, the charge and the mass of the
      charge, and the electric field, and observe that the blue and
      red portions of the last column are always identical in size
      to the individual blue (potential energy) and red (kinetic
      energy) columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Restore the settings made in Exercise 2, and PLAY the motion.
      Observe that the total height of the third column remains the
      same throughout the motion, indicating that the energy
      <i>E</i> is constant. At the same time, the other two columns
      are changing in size, in such a manner that an increase in
      the size of one is compensated by an equal decrease in the
      size of the other.
