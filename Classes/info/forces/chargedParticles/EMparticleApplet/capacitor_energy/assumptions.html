<div class="title">Assumptions - Charged Particle in Capacitor</div>
<br>
    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates the motion of a charged particle in the
      uniform electric field inside a parallel-plate capacitor,
      displays the electric force acting on the particle and the
      particle's potential and kinetic energies.
    </div>

    <p>The applet makes the following assumptions:</p>

	 <ul>

	 <li>A particle of charge <i>q</i> and mass <i>m</i> is moving in
	 the uniform electric field that exists between two infinitely
	 extended parallel uniformly charged plates.  Apart from the
	 force exerted on the particle by the electric field, no other
	 forces are acting on the particle.  

	 <p>The applet window shows only a finite portion of the infinitely
	 extended parallel-plate capacitor.</p>

	 </li>

	 <li>The electric potential energy <i>PE</i> is taken to be equal
	 to zero at the coordinate origin, which is in the lower left
	 corner of the region between the plates visible in the applet
	 window.  
	 </li>

	 </ul>
