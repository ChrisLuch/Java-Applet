<div class="title">Assumptions - Potential Energy and Potential In A
Non-Uniform Electric Field</div>

    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates the motion of a charged particle in a
      non-uniform electric field, displays the particle's potential and
      kinetic energies, and displays the electric potential at the
      particle's location and at other selected locations.
    </div>

    <p>The applet makes the following assumptions:

	 <p><ul>

	 <li>A particle of charge <i>q</i> and mass <i>m</i> is moving
	 in the electric field due to a <b>fixed</b> point charge.
	 The motion of the particle is assumed to have no effect on
	 the source charge.  The particle <b>tests</b> the field that
	 exists without the particle's presence.</li>
	 
	 <li>Consistent with the previous assumption, when using the
	 law of energy conservation for the system, no kinetic energy
	 of the source of the particle needs to be included.</li>

         <li>Apart from the force exerted on the test particle by the
         electric field, no other forces are acting on the test
         particle.</li>

	 <li>The electric potential <i>V</i> is taken to be equal to
	 zero at points that are an infinite distance away from the
	 source.  Consistent with that, the test particle's potential
	 energy <i>PE</i> in the electric field is also taken to be
	 zero when the particle is at an infinite distance from the
	 source.</li>

	 </ul>
