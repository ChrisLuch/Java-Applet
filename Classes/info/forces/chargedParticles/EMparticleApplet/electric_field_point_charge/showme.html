    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Construct the set of green field lines and
      mustard-colored equipotential lines shown in Figure 1 below
      as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Grid by selecting the Grid button <img src=
      "../elpotimages/Grid.gif" alt="Grid" align="top">. Then
      select the Coordinates button <img src=
      "../elpotimages/Coordinates.gif" alt="Coordinates" align="top">,
      and place field point markers at
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, -100) m,
      </li>
      <li>
        (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (100, -100) m,

      <li>
        (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (200,0) m.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each time a field point is placed, click the Field-Line button <img
      src="../elpotimages/FieldLine.gif" alt="Field Line" align="top">
      to display the green field line through the field point and the
      Equipotential-Line button <img src=
      "../elpotimages/EquipotentialLine.gif" alt= "Equipotential Line"
      align="top"> to display the mustard-colored equipotential line
      through the field point.  The latter is actually a circle with
      its center at the point source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then hide the Grid by clicking the Grid button again, and
      deselect the Coordinates button. Move the particle to
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (51, -86) m, a point on the innermost
      of the three equipotential circles.  Hide the particle's
      velocity vector.  The applet window should display the pattern
      shown in Figure 1 below.

      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Hint</u>. You may want to hold the SHIFT key down while
      moving the particle to its exact position, to restrict the
      direction of motion to horizontal or vertical. The
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)-coordinates of the particle are displayed in
      the Data box. The motion of a field point marker can be similarly
      restricted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Select the Coordinates button again, move
      the mouse pointer to one of the existing field point markers,
      click on the marker and drag it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field line and equipotential circle through the field point
      should move along with the field point. Note how the value of the
      electric potential <i>V</i> at the point changes as you drag
      the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Display the Vector Panel by selecting the
      Vectors button.  Check Electric Field on the Vector Panel.
      Electric field vectors in green will be drawn through all field
      points set by you.  Drag one of the field points (the
      Coordinates button needs to be selected to be able to drag a
      field point), and observe the electric field vector as the field
      point is varied.
    </p>
    <p>
     Uncheck Electric Field on the Vector Panel.  All electric field
     vectors will disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Deselect the Coordinates button. Then click
      on the source charge and drag it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe how the field lines and equipotential lines through the
      fixed field points get re-oriented and how the coordinates of
      the fixed field points and the values of the potential at these
      points change.
    </p>
    <p>The field lines remain radial lines and the equipotential
      circles stay concentric with the source and remain perpendicular
      to the field lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The origin of the coordinate system stays attached to the source
      charge, which means that the coordinates of the fixed field
      points have to change.  You can see this clearly if you display
      the Grid while dragging the source.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Vary the value <i>Q</i> of the source charge
      with the source charge slider.  Choose both positive and
      negative values of <i>Q</i>.  Observe the values of the electric
      potential on the equipotential curves.  Which curves have the
      higher potential, the inner ones or the outer ones?
    </p> 
    <p>
      Display the test particle's acceleration vector.  Observe the
      direction of the electric field by observing the test particle's
      acceleration.  You may have to move the test particle closer to
      the source to get an acceleration vector of good size.  When the
      test particle's charge is positive, the particle's acceleration
      is in the direction of the electric field.  Does the electric
      potential increase or decrease in the direction of the electric
      field?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answers.</b> When the source charge is positive, the electric
      potential decreases from inside to outside.  When the source
      charge is negative, it is the other way around.  The electric
      field always points from high to low electric potential.

    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The source charge should have the value <i>Q</i> = 3 mC, the
      three location markers with field and equipotential lines
      through them should be at
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0, -100) m,

        (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (200,0) m,
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      and the test particle should be located on the innermost
      equipotential circle at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (51, -86) m.  
    </p>
    <p>
      When this is done correctly, the electric potentials on the
      three displayed equipotential circles should be decreasing in
      the outward direction from 2.70&times;10<sup>5</sup> V, to
      1.81&times;10<sup>5</sup> V, to 1.35&times;10<sup>5</sup> V.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continue with the applet in the state shown
      in Figure 2 above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the particle's displacement vector by selecting the
      Vectors button <img src="../elpotimages/Vectors.gif"
      alt="Vectors" align="top">. This will display the Vector Panel.
      Check Displacement on this panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you never clicked the Initial button <img src=
      "../elpotimages/Initial.gif" alt="Initial Position and Energy"
      align="top"> since last resetting the applet, you should see the
      image shown in Figure 3 below.

    <p>
      The blue displacement vector goes from the particle's default
      position to the particle's current position at
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (51,-87) m.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continue with the state of the applet as you
      left it in Exercise 2. Now click the Initial button.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blue displacement vector should disappear. However, if you
      drag the particle with the mouse, the displacement vector will
      reappear, this time with its tail end at the location occupied
      by the particle when the Set-Initial-Position button was
      clicked, which in this case is at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (51,-87)
      m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the Set-Initial-Position button once more, and again drag
      the particle.  The displacement vector should be drawn from the
      location where the particle was when the Set-Initial-Position
      button was clicked last.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Continue with the applet from Exercise 3,
      and display the Energy box. Drag the particle again, and
      observe the energy column labeled "final". It gets adjusted
      during the dragging so that the potential energy column
      always represents the potential energy at the current
      particle position. The energy column labeled "initial"
      remains unchanged. It shows the particle's kinetic and
      potential energies at the moment the Set-Initial-Position
      button was clicked last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now click the Set-Initial-Position button, and observe the
      change in the "initial" energy column.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should find that the "initial" column gets adjusted to be
      identical to the "final" column. The current value of the
      potential energy has become the new initial value.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Set a location marker at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)
      = (0, -100) m and display the electric field line and
      equipotential circle through this point.  Move the particle to a
      point on the equipotential circle.  See Figure 4 below.

      <img src="../elpotimages/PotNonUniOneEqui.gif" alt=
      "Particle at Origin">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 4</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Data box (not displayed in Figure 4) shows the particle's
      potential energy <i>PE</i> in the electric field and the
      potential <i>V</i> at the particle's location.  If the test
      particle's charge <i>q</i> is equal to 2 mC, you should be able
      to observe values close to
      <i>PE</i> = 539 J and <i>V</i> = 2.70&times;10<sup>5</sup>,
      depending on where exactly you place the particle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Energy box, the mustard-colored bar reprenting <i>V</i>
      should extend somewhat above the zero level indicated by the
      horizontal line across all three bars.
    </p>  
    <p>
      There are two energy columns in the Energy box, one labeled
      "initial", one "final".  In Figure 4, the "initial" column
      represents the energies when the applet was reset.  The "final"
      column represents the current energies corresponding to the
      moment shown in Figure 4.
    </p>
    <p>Like the mustard-colored <i>V</i> column, the blue <i>PE</i>
      columns in both energy bars should extend somewhat above the
      zero level. The particle's kinetic energy, <i>KE</i>, is
      represented by the red column above the blue potential energy
      column.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Drag the particle to points inside the
      equipotential circle and points outside the equipoential circle,
      and observe changes in the potential and in the two energy
      columns.  Display the velocity vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      There should be no changes in the "initial" energy column, but
      both the potential column and the final energy column should
      increase in height as you move closer to the source and decrease
      in height as you move away from the source.  Changes in total
      height of the final energy column should be due entirely to
      changes in the potential energy portion of the column since the
      kinetic energy remains constant while the velocity is not
      being changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, adjust to the
      following settings:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
       source charge: <i>Q</i> = 3 mC
      </li>
      <li>
        particle charge: <i>q</i> = 2 mC
      </li>
      <li>
        particle mass: <i>m</i> = 3.0 kg
      </li>
      <li>
        test particle position:
        (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (100, -100) m
      </li>
      <li>
        particle velocity:
        (<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) = (-12, 18) m/s .
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Click the Initial button. The energy
      bar labeled "initial" should get adjusted to look like the bar
      labeled "final".
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the Trace toggle button, and PLAY the motion. Observe the
      changes in the columns in the Energy box during the
      motion. PAUSE the motion at some point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particle should be moving on a hyperbolic path curving away
      from the source. As the particle is moving closer to the source,
      both its potential energy, as indicated by the blue column in
      the "final" energy bar, and the potential at the particle's
      location, as indicated by the mustard-colored bar, should be
      increasing.  The values of these two quantities can also be
      observed in the Data box.  These values should be decreasing
      when the particle is moving away from the source.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particle's total energy should remain constant, as indicated
      by the fact that the "final" energy bar maintains the same total
      height as the "initial" bar throughout the motion. The only
      change during the motion is in the composition of the "final"
      bar: when the potential energy portion gets larger, the kinetic
      energy portion gets smaller, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click REWIND <img src="../elpotimages/Rewind.gif" alt= "Rewind"
      align="top"> and then PLAY to observe this again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Continuing from Exercise 3, click Replay.
      Reverse the sign of the test particle's charge so that
      <i>q</i> = -2 mC instead of <i>q</i> = 2 mC. Observe the change
      in the potential bar and the "final" energy bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      There should be no change in the potential column, but the blue
      potential energy column in the "final" energy bar now should
      reach only to a point below the zero level, instead of above the
      zero level when <i>q</i> = 2 mC.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the Set-Initial-Position button, and PLAY the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the hyperbolic trajectory will curve towards the
      source charge.  The potential energy should be decreasing when
      the test particle is approaching the source and increasing when
      the particle is moving away from the source, just the opposite
      of what was the case for positive test particle charge.  The
      electric potential should behave as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Continuing from Exercise 4, click REPLAY.
      PLAY the motion again, but this time PAUSE when the test
      particle is closest to the source.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, the bar representing <i>V</i> has grown beyond
      the height of the Energy box and the top of the "final"
      potential energy column has moved to a point below the bottom of
      the Energy box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now pull the Energy Zoom slider in the Energy box downward, to
      decrease the scale of the energy and potential bars. The top of
      the <i>V</i>-bar should come back into view and so should the
      top of the <i>PE</i>-column. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Resume the motion. If you keep the motion running, while the
      test particle is moving farther and farther away from the source
      charge, the top ends of the potential bar and of the potential
      energy column will approach the zero level.  Move the Energy
      Zoom slider all the way to the top to magnify the deviation from
      the zero level as much as possible. When this deviation is too
      small to be observable in the graphical representation, you can
      continue to observe changes in the values of the potential and
      of the potential energy, as well as those of other quantities,
      in the Data box and in the Velocity data fields.
