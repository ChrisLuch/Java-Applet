      Lesson - Potential Energy and Potential In A Non-Uniform Electric Field
    </div>
    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates the motion of a charged particle in a
      non-uniform electric field, displays the particle's potential and
      kinetic energies, and displays the electric potential at the
      particle's location and at other selected locations.

      <b>Prerequisites</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should be familiar with the concepts of charge,
      electric field, and electric field lines, and Coulomb's law
      of electrostatics and Newton's second law of motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Learning Outcomes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students will be able to review the definition of the electric
      field, will be introduced to the concepts of electric potential
      and potential energy in an electric field, and the relationship
      between electric field and electric potential and the parallel
      relationship between electric force and electric potential
      energy. They will learn to apply these concepts in the situation
      where the electric field is due to a single point charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should know how the applet functions, as described
      in Help and ShowMe.
    </p>
    <p>

          <u>Comment 1</u>. Electric fields produced by source
          charges at rest, i.e., fields that are superpositions of
          fields due to point charges at rest, are called
          <i>electrostatic</i> fields. Coulomb's law implies that
          the force <img src="../elpotimages/F.gif" alt="vector F"
          align="bottom"> exerted on a charged test particle in
          such a field is proportional to the charge <i>q</i> of
          the test particle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, for an electrostatic field, dividing
             <img src="../elpotimages/F.gif" alt="vector F" align=
             "bottom"> by <i>q</i> in Definition (4) gives a
             quantity <img src="../elpotimages/E.gif" alt=
             "vector E" align="bottom"> that is independent of
             <i>q</i>. Thus, <img src="../elpotimages/E.gif" alt=
             "vector E" align="bottom"> characterizes an "electric
             intensity" that is present without the test particle
             and does not depend on any properties of the test
             particle.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is true in general for all kinds of electric fields,
          not only electrostatic fields, but also so-called
          <i>induced</i> electric fields that are due to changing
          magnetic fields.
        </p>
	<p>
          For an electric field due to a single point charge, as in
          the present applet, Definition (4) implies that the vector
          <img src="../elpotimages/E.gif" alt= "vector E"
          align="bottom"> at a given field point points in the radial
          direction away from or towards the source, depending on
          whether the source charge is positive or negative,
          respectively.  This is so because the Coulomb force exerted
          on a positive test particle by the source charge is
          repulsive or attractive for positive or negative source
          charge, respectively.
	</p>
	<p>
          Definition (4), in combination with the Coulomb force
          expression (2), also implies that the magnitude <i>E</i> of
          the vector <img src="../elpotimages/E.gif" alt= "vector E"
          align="bottom"> at a field point a distance <i>r</i> away
          from the source is equal to k|Q|/r<sup>2</sup>.

          When one obtains force expression (5) in this way, it may
          seem to amount to nothing more than the definition of the
          electric field. However, it is not trivial that in a
          general electric field the force exerted on a test
          particle is proportional to the particle's charge
          <i>q</i> (or that the ratio in Definition (4) is
          independent of the charge in more general than just
          electrostatic cases).
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 3</u>. Definition (4) implies that the SI-unit
          of the electric field is N/C. This unit is equal to the
          unit V/m, which is discussed in Comment 1 under "Electric
          Potential and Equipotential Lines" below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 4</u>. The electric field is defined at all
          points in space. It is therefore not a single vector, but
          a "vector-valued function defined on space". This simply
          means that to describe the electric field one must
          specify the vectors <img src="../elpotimages/E.gif"
             alt="vector E" align="top"> at all points in space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 5</u>. An <i>electric field line</i> is a line
          (not a straight line in general) that indicates the
          direction of the electric field vectors at points along
          the line.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The electric field vector at a given point on an
          <i>electric field line</i> is tangential to the line at
          that point.

        <p>
          A static electric field, i.e., a field accompanying one
          or more source charges at rest, has the property that it
          can be derived from a simpler field called the
          <i>electric potential</i>. The electric potential field
          is simpler because it is a scalar field, not a vector
          field like the electric field. The electric potential
          field assigns a scalar quantity to any given point in
          space called the <i>electric potential at that point</i>.
          The SI-unit of the electric potential is the volt (V).
        </p>
        <p>
          How can a scalar field give rise to a vector field? A
          static electric field is constructed from its electric
          potential field as follows.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Suppose you know the electric potential field and want to
          know the electric field vector at a given point P. Look
          at the electric potential in the neighborhood of P. Find
          the direction leading away from P in which the electric
          potential decreases more rapidly than in any other
          direction. This is the direction in which the electric
          vector at P points. 
          <p>
            The magnitude <i>E</i> of the electric vector at P is
            equal to the magnitude of the distance-rate-of-change
            of the electric potential,

            equals |<i>V</i>(P') - <i>V</i>(P)| where P' is a point
            near P that, seen from P, lies in the direction of most
            rapid decrease of <i>V</i> and where <i>d</i> is the
            distance between P and P'.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the electric potential is constant throughout a
            small neighborhood of P or if the electric potential
            has a maximum or minimum at P, the electric field at P
            is zero.

          <u>Comment 1</u>. Definition (6) implies that the SI-unit
          for the electric field is the V/m. As mentioned in
          Comment 3 under "Definition of Electric Field and
          Electric Field Lines" above, Definition (4) gives the N/C
          as the SI-unit of the electric field. Equating the two
          units and solving the resulting equation for V gives the
          volt in terms of other SI-units,

	  It is useful for applications in physics to think of the
	  symbol <i>dV</i>/<i>dr</i> as a ratio of two very small
	  quantitities, <i>dV</i> and <i>dr</i>, although strictly
	  speaking <i>dV</i>/<i>dr</i> is just a shorthand for the
	  limit (8).  The reason this is possible is that when
	  <i>dV</i> and <i>dr</i> are very small, their ratio will be
	  very close to the value of the limit (8).  Also,
	  experimentally, one can not go to the limit of vanishing
	  <i>dV</i> and <i>dr</i> but must measure finite <i>dV</i>
	  and <i>dr</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
	  <u>Comment 5</u>. Taking <i>dV</i>/<i>dr</i> as a ratio of
	  two small quantities, one can calculate
          <i>E</i> from Equ.(9) using two points P and P' on an
          electric field line that are a small distance <i>dr</i>
          apart.  Vice versa, solving Equ.(9) for <i>dV</i>, one can
          calculate the small change <i>dV</i> = <i>V</i>(P') -
          <i>V</i>(P) in electric potential in going from point P to
          P'. If P', when seen from P, is in the direction of the
          electric field, i.e., in the direction of most rapid
          decrease of <i>V</i>, then
        </p>

          <u>Comment 6</u>. In general, the potential in the
          vicinity of a given point P will be decreasing in some
          directions, increasing in others, and remain constant
          along a line through P dividing the directions of
          decreasing and increasing potential. This dividing line
          is the "equipotential line" through P.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          An <i>equipotential line</i> is a line along which the
          electric potential is constant.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Such lines are not straight in general. In the present case
          of a field due to a point charge with radial electric field
          lines, the equipotential lines are concentric circles with
          the source of the field as the center of the equipotential
          circles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that one is dealing with equipotential <b>lines</b>
          when considering only <b>two</b> dimensions. In three
          dimensions, one has equipotential <b>surfaces</b>. For a
          point source field in three dimensions, the equipotential
          surfaces are concentric spheres with the source as the
          center of the spheres.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 7</u>. The electric field vector at a given
          point is always perpendicular to the equipotential line
          through that point because the perpendicular direction is
          the direction of most rapid change of the potential. As a
          consequence, electric field lines and equipotential lines
          cross at right angles at any given point.

          <u>Comment 1</u>. Equ.(13) is the same as Equ.(5).
          Equ.(12) is a definition of the potential energy in terms
          of the electric potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 2</u>. The vector <img src=
          "../elpotimages/E.gif" alt="vector E" align="bottom"> is
          different in general at different points in space. In the
          present case of a field due to a point source, the field
          vector has a radial direction and a magnitude proportional
          to 1/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> where <i>r</i> is the distance of
          the field point from the source.  Thus the field vector
          varies in direction and magnitude as the field point is
          varied.
	</p>  
	<p>
	  Therefore the force <img src="../elpotimages/F.gif"
          alt="vector F" align="bottom"> is a function of position
          also.  Thus, Equation (13) defines a <i>force field</i>. In
          the present case of a field due to a point source the force
          is given by Coulomb's law, which is summarized above under
          "Coulomb's Law of Electrostatics". 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the electric potential is a scalar field,
          Definition (12) makes the potential energy of a test
          particle a scalar field as well. All this means is that
          the potential energy is a scalar quantity whose value
          depends in general on where the test particle is.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 3</u>. The electric field points from high to
          low potential, in the direction of the most rapid
          decrease of the potential. Because of Eqs.(12) and (13),
          the force points from high to low potential energy, in
          the direction of the most rapid decline of the potential
          energy. This statement is obviously true for positive
          charge <i>q</i>, but it is true also for negative charge.
          Why?
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 4</u>. Equ.(7) says that the volt is equal to
          1 J/C. Therefore, the SI-unit of the quantity <i>PE</i>
          defined in Equ.(10) is C &times; J/C = J. The joule (J)
          is the unit of energy. Thus, <i>PE</i> has the right
          units to be some kind of energy. The next two comments
          will make it clear that <i>PE</i> is indeed a potential
          energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 5</u>. By multiplying Equs.(6), (8), and (9)
          on both sides by <i>q</i> one obtains analogous equations
          relating the force <img src="../elpotimages/F.gif"
             alt="vector F" align="bottom"> exerted on the charged
             particle to the potential energy <i>PE</i> of the
             paricle in the field.

        <p>
          Thus, Equ.(8) implies that the magnitude <i>F</i> of the
          force on a test particle in the electric field of a point
          source is given by

          Again, interpreting <i>dPE</i> and <i>dr</i> as very small
          quantities, one can calculate <i>F</i> from Equ.(15) as a
          ratio of two small quantities. This equation can be inverted
          to give the small change <i>dPE</i> = <i>PE</i>(P') -
          <i>PE</i>(P) in the potential energy of the particle as the
          particle moves from point P to a point P' that is close to P
          and on the same electric field line:
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <i>dPE</i> = <i>PE</i>(P') -

          Here P', when viewed from P, is in the direction of most
          rapid decrease of <i>PE</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For an electric field due to a point source, as in the
          present applet, Equ.(16) is true also if P and P' do not lie
          on the same field line.  This is so because the electric
          potential and the potential energy depend only on <i>r</i>
          in this special case.  In the case of a more general field,
          and for an arbitrary pair of points P and P' that are close
          to each other, Equ.(16) must be generalized by replacing the

          This is precisely the standard definition of a potential
          energy. First of all, one defines potential energy in terms
          of its <b>change</b>, <i>dPE</i>; one does not define the
          potential energy <i>PE</i> itself. This leaves an additive
          constant in the potential energy undetermined that one is
          free to choose any way that is convenient. Second, if a
          potential energy can be associated with a force field
          (possible for special force fields only that are called
          <i>conservative</i>), then it is the negative of the work
          done by the force that is equated with the change in the
          potential energy. The reason why one uses the
          <b>negative</b> of the work in the definition of
          potential energy will be made clear in the following
          comment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 6</u>. By the work-kinetic energy theorem, the
          small amount of work <i>dW</i> done on the particle by the
          electric field is equal to the small change <i>dKE</i> in the
          particle's kinetic energy as the particle moves from P to
          P',
        </p>

        <p>
          In words, if the test particle in moving from P to P' gains
          an amount <i>dKE</i> of kinetic energy, then its potential
          energy changes by an amount equal to -<i>dKE</i>, i.e., it
          decreases by an equal amount.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is exactly the concept of potential energy. A
          particle has potential energy that can be converted into
          kinetic energy. If the kinetic energy increases by, say,
          5 J, the potential energy decreases by 5 J. Energy gets
          <b>converted</b> from potential to kinetic energy, and
          energy is neither created or destroyed. Energy
          conservation in this process can be exhibited more
          directly as follows.

        <b>Potential and Potential Energy in an Electric Field Due to a Point Charge</b>
        <p>
          For the case of an electric field due to a point charge, as
          in the present applet, one can use Equs.(10) and (16) or
          (11) and (17) to calculate the electric potential and the
          potential energy of a test particle in the field.
	</p>  
	<p>
          This calculation requires a calculus process called
          integration.  Integrating means summing the small changes
          <i>dV</i> in potential and <i>dPE</i> in potential energy
          along a path from a point P to another point P' an arbitrary
          distance away from P.
	</p>
	<p>
	  One needs to use Equ.(2) for the magnitude <i>F</i> of the
	  force exerted on the test particle by the source and the
	  corresponding expression <i>F</i>/|q| for the magnitude
	  <i>E</i> of the electric field at the point of the test
	  particle.  
	</p>
	<p>
	  Substituting for <i>q</i><sub>1</sub> the source charge
	  <i>Q</i> and for <i>q</i><sub>2</sub> the test charge
	  <i>q</i>, Equ.(2) gives
	</p>
          <p align="center">
            <i>F</i> =
            <i>k</i>|<i>Q</i>||<i>q</i>| /
            <i>r</i><sup>2</sup>.<img src="../elpotimages/small.gif"
            alt="space" height="1" width="40"> (23)
          </p>
	<p>
	  Dividing <i>F</i> by |<i>q</i>| gives

            <i>E</i> =

          With these expressions for <i>F</i> and <i>E</i>, the
          integration process gives for <i>PE</i> and <i>V</i> at a
          point that is a distance
          <i>r</i> away from the point source the following
          expressions.  (The calculation is a standard exercise in the
          application of calculus and will not be reproduced here.)

          Note that Expressions (25) and (26) involve the charges
          themselves, not their absolute values as in Equs.(23) and
          (24).  This is a consequence of the way the electric
          potential and and the potential energy are defined.  E.g.,
          the electric potential decreases in the direction of the
          electric field, and the latter depends on the sign of the
          source charge <i>Q</i>.  Therefore, the potential depends on
          <i>Q</i>, not |<i>Q</i>|.  In Equs.(23) and (24) on the
          other hand, we are dealing with the magnitudes of the force
          and electric field vectors, which by definition are positive
          quantities, so that on the right-hand sides of these
          equations we need to use the magnitudes of the charges.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <u>Comment 1</u>.  In Equs.(25) and (26), the arbitrary
	  additive constants have been chosen so that the potential energy
	  <i>PE</i> and the potential <i>V</i> both are equal to zero
	  for <i>r</i> equal to infinity, i.e., when the test particle
	  or the field point are infinitely far away from the source.
        </p>
	<p>
	  <u>Comment 2</u>.  The denominators in Expressions (25) and
	  (26) contain <i>r</i> to the <b>first</b> power, not to the
	  second power as in the force and field expressions (23) and
	  (24).  The first power is not a typographical error.
	</p>    
	<p>
	  <u>Comment 3</u>.  The potential energy and the potential as
	  given by Expressions (25) and (26), respectively, can take
	  both positive and negative values, depending on the signs of
	  the charges <i>Q</i> and <i>q</i>.  (The potential depends
	  only on <i>Q</i>.)

      For a positive source charge as in the present Exercise, the

      Equ.(5), for a test particle with positive charge as in this
      Exercise, the force acting on the test particle is in the
      direction of the electric field, i.e., also radially away from
      the source.  This is a repulsive force.  The direction of the

      and explain why the field lines and equipotential lines form the
      pattern you observe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The electric field lines are straight lines going
      from the source to infinitiy in a radial direction.  The force
      on a charged test particle at a given field point is in this
      direction, and therefore so is the electric field at that point.
      The electric field line through a given point has the direction
      of the field vector at that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equipotential line at a given field point is perpendicular
      to the electric field line at that point.  Therefore the
      equipotential "lines" are concentric circles whose centers are
      at the source point.  Such circles are perpendicular at any
      point to the radially directed field lines. An example of such a
      line pattern is shown in Figure 3 below.

      because the 10-m distance from one circle to the other is not an
      infinitesimal distance.  Still this 10-m distance is "small"
      enough because the electric field does not vary much in
      magnitude over this distance.  For more of an explanation, see

     percentage it differs from the magnitude of the field at 100 m
     from the source that was calculated above.  You will find that
     the two values don't differ by much.  This justifies the use of
     Equ.(10) in the preceding calculation.  Compare the percentage by
     which the two electric field values differ to the percentage
     error in result (37).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>.  Using the value of the magnitude of the
      electric field at <i>r</i> = 110 m calculated in Exercise 2,
      calculate the change in potential in going from a point at
      <i>r</i> = 110 m to a point at <i>r</i> = 120 m.  Use the result
      and the value of the potential at <i>r</i> = 110 m to predict
      the potential at <i>r</i> = 120 m.  Compare the result to the
      value given by the applet.
    <p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment</u>.  One can continue in this manner, calculating
      potential changes in small steps along a path from one point P
      to a distant point P' and adding the potential changes, and in
      that way obtain the potential change for two points P and P'
      quite far apart.  This is the integration process referred to at
      the beginning of the section "Potential and Potential Energy in
      an Electric Field Due to a Point Charge".  To get an exact
      result, one has to go to the limit of infinitely many such
      steps, each of vanishing size.  This limit summation can be
      performed symbolically.  The result is Expression (26) for the
      electric potential.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Reset the applet, and observe the value of
      <i>V</i> at the particle's location. <i>V</i> is displayed in
      the Data box.  Also, note the length of the <i>V</i>-column in
      the Energy box.  The test particle's charge <i>q</i> should be
      equal to the default value of 2 mC.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then vary the charge of the test particle, and observe the value
      of <i>V</i> displayed in the Data box and the length of the
      <i>V</i>-column in the Energy box while you are changing the
      charge. Explain your observations in terms of basic theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Neither the electric field nor the electric
      potential depend in any way on the properties of the test
      particle. They characterize the state of space without the
      test particle. Therefore, changing the charge of the test
      particle has no effect on the value of the electric potential
      at the particle's location.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Continuing from Exercise 4, vary the value of
      the source charge <i>Q</i>, including negative values. Observe
      the value of <i>V</i> in the Data box and the length of the
      <i>V</i>-column in the Energy box, and explain your observations
      in terms of basic theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. This time the electric potential does not stay
      the same.  When the source charge changes, the electric field
      changes.  See, e.g., Equ.(24) or Definition (4) of the electric
      field, in conjunction with Coulomb's law.  When the electric
      field changes, the potential must change according to the
      defining relationship between potential and field described
      under "Electric Potential and Equipotential Lines".  Note that
      <i>V</i> is positive for positive <i>Q</i> and negative for
      negative <i>Q</i>, in the case simulated by the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 6</b>. This Exercise is about the concept of an
      electric field vector as an indicator of the direction of most
      rapid decrease of the electric potential and the rate of this
      decrease.
    </p>
    <p>RESET the applet. Display two equipotential circles that are
      fairly close together, as in Figure 5 below.  Choose the two
      radii to be 100 m and 120 m.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 5</b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Place the particle at a point on the inner circle, as in Figure
     5, and click the Initial button <img
     src="../elpotimages/Initial.gif" alt="Set Initial Position and
     Energy" align="top">.  
    </p>
    <p>
     Drag the particle to a point on the outer equipotential circle
     while the displacement vector is displayed.  Drag the particle
     along the outer circle, and observe the magnitude of the
     displacement vector.  In which direction is it the least?
     Therefore, in which direction does the potential decrease the
     fastest?  Remember that the change in potential in going from one
     equipotential circle to another is constant, so that the
     direction of greatest rate of change of the potential is the
     direction in which the displacement vector is shortest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Estimate the magnitude of the electric field at <i>r</i> = 100 m
      from the potential change indicated in Figure 5.  The inner
      equipotential circle has a radius of 100 m.  Then obtain a
      better estimate by using the data in Figure 4, where the two
      equipotential circles are only 10 m apart, instead of 20 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. If you have chosen the particle's initial
      position as in Figure 5, the direction straight down is the
      direction of fastest decrease of the potential.  Note that the
      potential on the outer circle is less than on the inner circle,
      so that the potential is decreasing in the downward direction.
      You can verify that the electric field at the location of the
      particle in Figure 5 is downward by displaying the particle's
      acceleration vector.  The acceleration is in the direction of
      the force acting on the particle and, for positive test charge,
      this force is in the direction of the electric field, according
      to Definition (4).  Therefore, the acceleration points in the
      direction of the electric field as long as the test particle has
      positive charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      To calculate the magnitude <i>E</i> of the field, we use Equ.(9)
      with |<i>dV</i>| = |2.25&times;10<sup>5</sup> -
      2.70&times;10<sup>5</sup>| = 0.45&times;10<sup>5</sup> V and
      <i>dr</i> = 120 - 100 = 20 m.  Thus,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
     <i>E</i> = |<i>dV</i>/<i>dr</i>| = 0.45&times;10<sup>5</sup>/20 =
      2,250 V/m.<img src="../elpotimages/small.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40"> (38)
    </p>
    <p>
     This value is not particularly good, as a comparison with the
     exact value of 2,697 V/m shows.  This value is calculated in
     Equ.(36).  However, using a smaller value for
     <i>dr</i>, namely, the smaller <i>dr</i> of 10 m from Figure
     4, gives a noticeably better result:
    </p>
    <p align="center">
     <i>E</i> = |<i>dV</i>/<i>dr</i>| = |2.45&times;10<sup>5</sup> -
      2.70&times;10<sup>5</sup>| / 10 = 2,500 V/m.<img

      In your Notebook, describe the changes you observe in the
      particle's potential energy <i>PE</i>, kinetic energy
      <i>KE</i>, and total energy <i>E</i> as you step through the
      motion. Discuss if the changes are what you expect from basic
      theory. Also describe the changes in the electric potential
      <i>V</i> at the particle's position as you step through the
      motion, and explain them in terms of basic theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The potential <i>V</i> as a function of <i>r</i>
      is described by Equ.(26). According to this equation, if
      <i>Q</i> > 0, the potential increases as <i>r</i> decreases and
      decreases as <i>r</i> increases. Stepping through the motion
      should show this behaviour.  You will need to go beyond <i>t</i>
      = 6.00 s to see the behaviour for increasing <i>r</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the test particle's charge is positive, Definition (12)
      implies that the particle's potential energy behaves like the
      potential: it increases with decreasing <i>r</i> and vice
      versa. Since the total energy is conserved, the kinetic energy
      must decrease as the particle gets closer to the source, by as
      much as the potential energy increases. The particle slows down
      as it approaches the source.  It speeds up as it moves away from
      the source.  This makes sense intuitively because the Coulomb
      force is repulsive in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. Click REWIND.  The Data box will display the
      electric potential at the particle's start position as
      1.91&times;10<sup>5</sup> V.  Calculate the particle's potential
      energy at this point.  The test particle's charge is equal to 2
      mC.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Definition (12) of the potential energy,
      "<i>PE</i> = <i>qV</i>", gives the value <i>PE</i> =
      0.002&times;1.91&times;10<sup>5</sup> = 382 J. Compare this
      value with the one shown in the Data box.  The discrepancy of 1
      J between the two values is due to round-off error.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. Continuing from Question 1, change the charge
      of the test particle from <i>q</i> = 2 mC to <i>q</i> = -2
      mC. What are the values of the electric potential at
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (100, -100) m and of the particle's
      potential energy at this point now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The electric potential is still equal to
      1.91&times;10<sup>5</sup> V. Its value does not depend on any
      particle properties. However, the particle's potential energy
      has changed to -382 J, in accordance with Equ.(12).  (The Data
      box shows -381 J.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Question 2, with <i>q</i>
      = -2 mC, STEP through the motion until you are at
      time <i>t</i> = 6.00 s. What does the trajectory look like
      this time?
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the changes of the same quantities as in Exercise 1,
      and record in your Notebook if there are any differences
      compared to what you observed in Exercise 1. Explain the
      differences in terms of basic theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The trajectory is now curving towards the source
      charge.  Again, in accordance with Equ.(26), the electric
      potential at the test particle is increasing as the test
      particle is approaching the source and decreasing as it is
      moving away from the source.  Also, more fundamentally, as the
      particle is approaching the source, it is moving against the
      electric field and therefore into regions of higher electric
      potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential energy, however, has the opposite behaviour since
      it is equal to the potential multiplied by a negative constant.
      Thus, the potential energy decreases as the test particle moves
      closer to the source.  Also, since the force is attractive in
      this case, we would expect the particle to be gaining kinetic
      energy and therefore losing potential energy as it approaches
      the source.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, click REWIND and
      change the test particle's charge back to <i>q</i> = 2 mC.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure the particle's initial position and velocity at
      <i>t</i> = 0 are still equal to

      conservation.  The calculation is broken up into four segments.

      <u>Electric Potential <i>V</i> at P'</u>

      By Equ.(26) and using the value <i>r</i> = 86.7 m given in the
      Data box (check this value by calculating it from the given
      <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> coordinates), the potential at P' is equal to
    </p>

      <i>V</i>(P') = <i>kQ</i>/<i>r</i> =

    <p>
      The energy of the particle in the electric field is

      To calculate the potential energy at the start point, we need
      the distance <i>r</i> of the start point from the source.  This
      can be calculated from the <i>x</i>,</i>y</i> coordinates of the
      start point to be 141.42 m.  Verify this value.  Substituting it
