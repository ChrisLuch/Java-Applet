    </div>
    <p>
      This lesson will give insight into the physics concepts of
      force, especially tension, free-body diagrams, and Newton's
      second law of motion. The system studied involves objects
      moving with constant accelerations, and the lesson will
      review concepts related to motion with constant acceleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in
      this lesson are to be carried out in the applet. You may need
      to toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if
      your screen space is limited. You should be prepared to do
      calculations to verify the numbers that are generated by the
      applet.

    </p>
    <p>
      The lower edge of Block 2 will be at elevation <i>h</i> =
      1.30 m, and the upper edge of the yellow platform at <i>h</i>
      = 0, as in Figure 1 below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The masses of Blocks 1 and 2 will be <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> =
      600 g and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> = 400 g, respectively, and the
      pulley's mass will be 0. These mass values will be assumed in
      all of the following, except where otherwise noted.
      (<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> is fixed at 600 g in the applet, but
      <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> could be changed, as could the pulley
      mass.)

    </p>
    <p>
      Click on Block 1, and drag it until Block 2 is at elevation
      <i>h</i> = 3.00 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your window size is small, you may have to drag Block 1
      beyond the left edge of the window. As long as you don't
      release the mouse button while doing this, you can keep on
      dragging the block. Alternatively, you can resize the window
      by dragging its lower right-hand corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click PLAY. Observe the speedometer during the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Qualitatively, describe how the speedometer needle moves
      during the motion. What does the rate at which the speed
      changes during the motion suggest about the acceleration of
      the blocks?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. REWIND the applet, display the Data box,
      and STEP through the motion until Block 2 reaches <i>h</i> =
      0. Note down the values of the speed and the time at a number
      of instants. E.g., at <i>t</i> = 0.20 s, <i>v</i> = 0.8 m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make a table of the data and a graph of <i>v</i> vs.
      <i>t</i>. The graph should yield a straight line, within
      experimental uncertainties, if the acceleration is constant.
      From the graph, obtain an equation that describes <i>v</i> as
      a function of <i>t</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does the graph suggest that the acceleration is constant? If
      so, obtain a value for this acceleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note</b>. An Appendix at the end of this Lesson lists
      standard kinematical equations for motions with constant
      acceleration. The directions of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
      axes in the applet are chosen to coincide with the directions
      of motion and the directions of the accelerations of the
      blocks. Therefore the blocks' velocities and accelerations
      will all be positive (or zero) and therefore numerically
      equal to the corresponding speeds and magnitudes of
      acceleration. E.g., for Block 1 which is moving in the
      <i>x</i>-direction,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = <i>v</i> &nbsp;&nbsp; and
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a<sub>x</sub></i> = <i>a</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that we can use the abbreviated notations <i>v</i>
      and <i>a</i> in equations that normally would require the
      components <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>v<sub>a</sub></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>: Why would one expect the accelerations of
      the blocks in Fletcher's Trolley to be constant?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>: The force of gravity acting on Block 2, which
      drives the system, is constant. As a result, the force
      exerted by the string on Block 2 is constant also. Newton's
      second law of motion says that the net force acting on an
      object is proportional to the object's acceleration. Thus, if
      the forces acting on an object are constant, then the
      acceleration of the object is constant as well.

    <div class="sectionheading">
      Acceleration Calculated from the Masses of the Blocks
    </div>
    <p>
      An engineer who wants to design a system so that it has a
      certain acceleration must be able to calculate the
      acceleration from the parameters defining the system. In the
      case of Fletcher's Trolley, these parameters are the masses
      of the two blocks and the magnitude <i>g</i> of the
      acceleration due to gravity. (The pulley is assumed here to
      have zero mass.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>: Given the masses <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> =
      0.600 kg and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> = 0.400 kg, and <i>g</i> =
      9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>, how can one calculate the magnitude
      <i>a</i> of the acceleration of the two blocks after Block 1 has
      been released?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <u>Overview</u>. Applying Newton's second law to the two
        blocks separately will give two equations for two unknowns:
        <i>a</i> and the string tension <i>T</i>. (Both blocks have
        accelerations of the same magnitude <i>a</i> because the
        string is assumed not to stretch.) 
        <p>
          Note that for a massless and frictionless pulley and a
          massless string, the tension <i>T</i> in the string is
          the same on both sides of the pulley and everywhere along
          the sring and equal to the magnitudes
          <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> of the
          forces exerted by the string on blocks 1 and 2,
          respectively:
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <i>T</i> = <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Setting Up the Basic Equations</u>. The coordinate axes
        are defined in the applet (they are shown when you display
        the free-body diagrams): <i>x</i> horizontal and to the
        right, <i>y</i> vertical and downward. 
        <p>
          Make free-body diagrams for the two blocks, and compare them
          to the ones shown by the applet, as in Figure 2 below
          showing the system in motion.
        </p>
        <p align="center">

       <p align="center">
        <b>Figure 2</b>
       </p>
        <p>
          Applying Newton's second law to the two blocks separately
          yields the following two equations, governing the motion
          of the system. The special mass values assumed initially
          are used in these equations.
        </p>

          Block 1 (<i>x</i>-direction):
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>T</i> =
          0.6<i>a</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          Block 2 (<i>y</i>-direction): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <i>W</i><sub>2</sub> - <i>T</i> = 0.4<i>a</i>.
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
        </p>
          where
        <p align="center">
          <i>W</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>m</i><sub>2</sub><i>g</i> =
          0.40&times;9.8 = 3.92 N.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)
	</p>
        <p>
          You may want to verify that the values <i>a</i> = 3.92
          m/s<sup>2</sup> and <i>T</i> = 2.352 N satisfy these
          equations exactly.  These values are consistent, to within
          significant figures, to the values <i>a</i> = 3.92
          m/s<sup>2</sup> and <i>T</i> = 2.4 N displayed by the
          applet.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Solving the Equations</u>. Adding the left-hand sides
        and the right-hand sides of Eqs. (3) and (4) causes
        <i>T</i> to drop out and leads to the following equation
        for <i>a</i>: 
        <p align="center">
          <i>W</i><sub>2</sub> = 0.4<i>g</i> = 0.4&times;9.8 =
          0.6<i>a</i> + 0.4<i>a</i> = 1.0<i>a</i>
        </p>
          whence 
        <p align="center">
          <i>a</i> = 0.4x9.8 = 3.92 m/s<sup>2</sup>,
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          (6)
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the value displayed by the applet.

    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Change the value of the mass of Block 2 to
      800 g, and work out the acceleration of the blocks. Keep the
      pulley mass equal to 0. The mass of Block 1 is fixed at 600
      g.

    </p><a name="Tension"></a> 
    <div class="sectionheading">
      Tension in the String When the Blocks are Moving
    </div>
    <p>
      The tension is not measured as easily as the acceleration.
      One would have to insert a strain gauge into the string,
      which would not be massless and would have an effect on the
      conditions in the system including the tension. Thus, it is
      particularly important that one knows how to calculate the
      tension. E.g., an engineer who has to design a system like
      Fletcher's Trolley will want to know how strong to make the
      string so that it will not break under the tension that it
      has to sustain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>: How can one calculate the tension in the
      string when the blocks are moving?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. If one already has a value for the
      acceleration, the easiest way to find the tension is to
      substitute value (6) for <i>a</i> into Eq.(3). This
      immediately gives the value
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>T</i> = 0.600x3.92 = 2.352 N .
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet displays a value of 2.4 N, which is consistent
      with this within significant figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should verify that Eq.(4) too is satisfied by the
      pair of values (6) and (7).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the tension value of 2.352 N is <b>less</b> than the
      weight of Block 2. The latter is equal to 3.92 N, according to
      Eq.(5).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Work out the value of the tension while
      the blocks are moving if the mass of Block 1 is 800 g. Use
      the value of the acceleration obtained earlier.

    </div>
    <p>
      In the equations in the table below, it is assumed that an
      object is moving along an x-axis with constant acceleration
      <i>a<sub>x</sub></i>. For a motion along a y-axis with
      constant acceleration, the equations are analogous. You would
      only replace the subscript <i>x</i> by <i>y</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Notation</b>. Both the velocity, <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>, and
      the acceleration, <i>a<sub>x</sub></i>, will be written here
      with the subscript <i>x</i>. Quantities that carry the
      subscript <i>x</i> can be either positive or negative. The
      subscript notation distinguishes these quantities from others
      that can take on only positive values (or zero), like the
      speed, <i>v</i>, and the magnitude <i>a</i> of the
      acceleration. Quantities without subscript are equal to the
      absolute values of the corresponding quantities with
      subscript:
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>v</i> = |<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>| &nbsp;&nbsp; and
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>a</i> = |<i>a<sub>x</sub></i>|.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notation <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(<i>t</i>) indicates the
      value of the velocity <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> at time <i>t</i>.
      Similarly, <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>) indicates the value of the
      position <i>x</i> at time <i>t</i>.
