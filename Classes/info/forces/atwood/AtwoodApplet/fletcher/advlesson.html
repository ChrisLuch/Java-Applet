    <p>
      This lesson will give insight into the physics concepts of
      force, especially tension, free-body diagrams, and Newton's
      second law of motion. The system studied involves objects
      moving with constant accelerations, and the lesson will
      review concepts related to motion with constant acceleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in
      this lesson are to be carried out in the applet. You may need
      to toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if
      your screen space is limited. You should be prepared to do
      calculations to verify the numbers that are generated by the
      applet.

        <u>Introduction of a System Dynamically Equivalent to
        Fletcher's Trolley</u> 
        <p>
          Before working through this section, you should have worked
          through the section "Acceleration Calculated from the Masses
          of the Blocks" in the Lesson available above. Here, the
          acceleration will be calculated once more, by a quicker
          method. However, this method must first be justified, and
          this justification involves a comparison with the method
          used in the section from the other Lesson.
        </p>
        <p>
          As in the Lesson, let us assume the pulley in Fletcher's
          Trolley to be massless. Let us consider another system that
          looks somewhat different from Fletcher's Trolley, the system
          of two horizontally moving blocks shown in Figure 1
          below. Figure 1 also shows he free-body diagrams for the two
          blocks in this new system.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <img src="fletcherlinear.gif" alt=
          "Linear Fletcher System">
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <b>Figure 1</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The system consists of two blocks with the same masses as
          in Fletcher's Trolley, 600 g and 400 g. The blocks are
          connected by a massless, inextensible string and can
          slide without friction on a horizontal table. A force of
          magnitude 3.92 N is acting on block 2 to the right. This
          force has the same magnitude as the force of gravity that
          is acting on block 2 in the downward direction in
          Fletcher's Trolley.
        </p>
	<p>
          Compare the free-body diagrams for the horizontally moving
          system to those for Fletcher's Trolley, which are shown in
          Figure 2 below.  Draw both sets of free-body diagrams side
          by side in your Notebook, for practice and to have them there
          for later reference.

	</p>
        <p>
          The horizontally moving system is dynamically equivalent to
          Fletcher's Trolley, because Newton's second law applied to
          the two horizontally moving blocks leads to the same
          equations that apply to Fletcher's trolley, namely, Eqs. (3)
          and (4) from the Lesson.  They will be quoted as (L3) and
          (L4) here:
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          Block 1 (<i>x</i>-direction):
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>T</i> =
          0.6<i>a</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (L3)
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          Block 2 (<i>y</i>-direction): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <i>W</i><sub>2</sub> - <i>T</i> = 0.4<i>a</i>.
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(L4)
        </p>
	<p>
         Remember that the weight <i>W</i><sub>2</sub> of Block 2 is
         equal to 0.4<i>g</i> = 0.4&times;9.8 = 3.92 N.  The magnitude
         of the horizontal force applied on Block 2 in the
         horizontally moving system must be chosen to be equal to
         <i>W</i><sub>2</sub>.
        <p>
          To derive Eqs. (L3) and (L4) for the horizontally moving
          system, look at the free-body diagrams for this system and
          and those for Fletcher's Trolley in your Notebook.  Pay
          particular attention to the forces on the two blocks that
          are directed along the lines of motion of the blocks.  
        </p>
	<p>
	  As far as the forces along the lines of motion of the blocks
          are concerned, they look identical, except that the diagram
          for Block 2 in the horizontal system is turned by
          90<sup>0</sup> relative to that in Fletcher's Trolley.  The
          free-body diagram for Block 2 in the horizontally moving
          system also contains two vertical forces, indicated by
          yellow and maroon arrows, that are absent in the free-body
          diagram for Block 2 in Fletcher's Trolley.  However, these
          forces are perpendicular to the line of motion of the blocks
          and have no effect on the acceleration and tension, the two
          quantities that we are interested in here.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the same sets of forces are acting on the two pairs of
          blocks along the lines of motion of the blocks with the same
          values for the masses and applied forces, Newton's second
          law applied to both sets of blocks will yield the same
          Eqs. (L3) and (L4) for both systems.  Obviously then, the
          same values for <i>a</i> and <i>T</i> will satisfy these
          equations for both systems.  
	</p>
	<p>
	  Thus, the two systems are dynamically equivalent. All the
          pulley does is to change the direction of the string and the
          direction of motion of Block 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is there an advantage in considering the horizontal system
          in place of Fletcher's Trolley? <b>Yes</b>, because it is
          easier to find the acceleration for the horizontal
          system. In the Lesson, which deals with Fletcher's Trolley,
          one has to solve the coupled equations (L3) and (L4). For
          the horizontal system, however, there is another, simpler
          way to find the acceleration. Here is what one can do.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Setting up the Basic Equation</u>.  In the horizontally
        moving system, both blocks and the string move in unison and
        move like the center of mass of the system. By Newton's second
        law for systems, the net external force acting on a system is
        equal to the system's mass times the acceleration of the
        center of mass, which in this case is equal to the
        acceleration of either block. Thus, for the acceleration
        <i>a</i> of either block we have the equation <p
        align="center"> 3.92 N = (0.600 kg + 0.400 kg) <i>a</i> = 1.00
        &times;
          <i>a</i>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Solving the Equation</u>. This step is trivial: 
        <p align="center">
          <i>a</i> = 3.92 m/s<sup>2</sup> .
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the same as value (L6) from the Lesson, obtained
          in the Lesson by solving equations (L3) and (L4).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Comment</u>. In applying Newton's second law to a system,
        the <b>only</b> forces that need to be considered in finding
        the acceleration of the system's center of mass are the
        <b>external</b> forces. The internal forces, in the horizontal
        system the forces exerted by the string on the two blocks, do
        not need to be considered in finding the acceleration.  This
        makes it easy to determine the motion of the center of mass.
       <p>
	Although the same is true for Fletcher's Trolley, it is of no
        use to determine the acceleration of the center of mass
        because the parts of the system do not move in unison: one
        block moves horizontally and the other one vertically.  Thus,
        the motion of the center of mass is not the same as that of
        either block.  Also, not all external forces acting on the
        system are known. Thus, we need to consider each block
        separately.  
      </li>

      Working with Symbols
    </div>
    <p>
      Suppose one has to find the accelerations and tensions in
      Fletcher's Trolley for several sets of masses. If one has worked
      things out for one set of mass values, using numbers from the
      start as in the section "Acceleration Calculated from the Masses
      of the Blocks" in the Lesson, one would have to do an analogous
      calculation all over again for the next pair of mass values,
      etc. However, if instead of working with explicit mass values
      one works with the symbols <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and
      <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> and derives general expressions for
      <i>a</i> and <i>T</i> in terms of the symbols  <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and
      <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>, one simply has to substitute any given
      mass values into the final expressions for <i>a</i> and
      <i>T</i>.  In other words, one can find the answers by "plugging
      into formulas".
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us derive such general expressions for <i>a</i> and <i>T</i>
      using only symbols.  Again, let the pulley be massless. The
      derivation will apply equally to Fletcher's Trolley and the
      equivalent system of horizontally moving blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will do derivation first by applying Newton's second law to
      the two blocks separately, as was done in the Lesson. The two
      blocks can be those in Fletcher's trolley or those in the
      horizontally moving system.  You should convince yourself that
      the equations written down below apply in either case.
      Subsequently we will derive the same results once more by
      following the simpler approach suggested above, i.e., by setting
      up an equation for the center of mass of the horizontally moving
      system directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Applying Newton's second law to the two
      blocks in Fletcher's Trolley or in the horizontally moving
      system leads to Eqs. (L3) and (L4).  These equations use
      explicit values for the masses of the two blocks.  Generalize
      these equations so that the mass values are replaced by the
      symbols <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>, and then
      obtain general expressions for <i>a</i> and <i>T</i> in terms of
      <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> by solving these
      equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hint</b>.  For the weight <i>W</i><sub>2</sub> of Block 2,
      use Expression (L5).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Solution</b>.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <u>Setting up the Basic Equations</u>. 
        <p>
          <u>Newton 2 applied to Block 1, x-direction only, when
          the blocks are in motion</u>:
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <i>T</i> = <i>m<sub>1</sub>a</i>.
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Newton 2 applied to Block 2, y-direction only, when
          the blocks are in motion</u>:
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>T</i> = <i>m<sub>2</sub>a</i>.
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
        </p>
        <p>
          Equations (3) and (4) are the generalizations in terms of
          symbols of equations (L3) and (L4).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Solving the Equations</u>. 
        <p>
          When we add the two left-hand sides and the two
          right-hand sides, the tension cancels and we get an
          equation that involves only the unknown <i>a</i>,
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> = (<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> +
          <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>)<i>a</i>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          (5)
        </p>
          whence 
        <p align="center">
          <i>a</i> = <i>W<sub>2</sub></i>/(<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> +
          <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>) =
          [<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>/(<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> +
          <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>)] <i>g</i>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)
        </p>
        <p>
          where <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> = <i>m<sub>2</sub>g</i> has
          been used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eq.(6) gives us an expression for <i>a</i> into which we can
          substitute the given mass values. With
          <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> = 0.600 kg and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>
          = 0.400 kg, this gives
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <i>a</i> = [0.4/(0.6 + 0.4)] x 9.8 = 3.92 m
          s<sup>-2</sup>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7)
        </p>
        <p>
          This is again value (L6) for <i>a</i>, and it is also the
          value given by the applet.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get the general expression for the tension <i>T</i>,
          we substite Expression (6) into Eq.(3). This gives

        <p align="center">
          <i>T</i> =
          [<i>m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub></i>/(<i>m<sub>1</sub></i>
          + <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>)] <i>g</i>, &nbsp;&nbsp; when
          blocks are moving.
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)
        </p>
        <p>
          Substituting the present mass values into Eq.(8),
          gives for the tension when the blocks are in motion

        <p align="center">
          <i>T</i> = [0.6x0.4/(0.6 + 0.4)] x 9.8 = 2.352 N.
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the same as value (L7).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Simplified Approach Using the Equivalent Horizontal
        System</u>.  When applying Newton's second law to the
        horizontal system as whole, one immediately obtains Eq.(5)
        above,
        <p align="center">
          <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> = (<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> +
          <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>)<i>a</i>.
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          (5)
        </p>
        <p>
          The horizontal external force applied to the horizontally
        moving Block 2 must be chosen to have magnitude
        <i>W<sub>2</sub></i>, so that this force has the same
        magnitude as the external force acting along the line of
        motion of Block 2 in Fletcher's Trolley.
        </p>
	<p>
          Eq.(5) can be solved for <i>a</i> as before.  If one is
          interested also in the tension, one will have to consider
          individual blocks as in the other approach and set up either
          Eqs. (3) or (4).  Given the value of <i>a</i>, the tension
          can then easily be found from either of these equations.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Comments</u>. The general expressions (6) and (8) for
        <i>a</i> and <i>T</i> have other advantages besides saving
        one the hassle of having to solve the basic equations every
        time all over again. Here are some of these. 
        <p>
	</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            One can check the dimensions of expressions (6) and
            (8). If they are correct, then this is evidence that
            the answers are correct. In Expression (6), the ratio
            of masses is dimensionless. That leaves us with
            <i>g</i> on the right-hand side which has the dimension
            of acceleration, as does the left-hand side. Thus,
            Eq.(6) is correct dimensionally. One cannot carry
            out such a check if one works with numbers. 
            <p>
              In Expression (8), the numerator of the fraction is
              the square of a mass and the denominator a mass.
              Thus, the ratio of the two is a mass. Multiplied by
              g, which has the units of acceleration, gives a force
              because mass times acceleration is a force. Thus, the
              right-hand side has the dimensions of force, which is
              as it should be because tension has the dimensions of
              force as well.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            One can test Expression (8) for the tension by checking
            whether it gives the right answer in an extreme case
            where one knows intuitively what the tension should be.
            E.g., take <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> = 0. In this case, one
            would expect the tension <i>T</i> to be zero.
            Expression (8) does give this answer.

      Conditions Affecting the Tension
    </div>
    <p>
    </p>
      <p>
        <b>Question 1</b>. Expression (8) gives the tension in the
        string when the blocks are moving. Obviously, the value of
        the tension depends on the masses of the blocks. What other
        conditions could be varied that might affect the tension? 
      </p>  
	<p>
          E.g., does Expression (8) still apply when Block 1 is
          held fixed and the system is at rest? In other words,
          does the tension have the same value no matter whether
          the blocks are moving or are at rest? Or is the tension
          perhaps larger when the blocks are accelerating?
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Answer</b>. Look at the free-body diagrams in Figure 3
          below showing the system when Block 1 is held fixed.

          The free-body diagram for Block 2 shows the same two
          forces acting on the block now as when the block is
          moving: the upward force of magnitude
          <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> = <i>T</i> exerted by the string and
          the downward force of gravity of magnitude
          <i>W<sub>2</sub></i>. However, this qualitative
          similarity does not mean that <i>T</i> has the same value
          in both cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the free-body diagram for Block 2, Newton's
          second law implies equation of motion (4) for the block,
          already considered earlier:
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>T</i> = <i>m<sub>2</sub>a</i>.
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
        </p>
        <p>
          When the blocks are in motion, <i>a</i> &gt; 0 so that
          the right-hand side is positive. This implies that the
          tension is smaller than the weight when the blocks are
          moving. However, when the blocks are at rest, <i>a</i> =
          0. With that, Eq.(4) implies that the tension is
          <b>equal</b> to the weight. Thus, the tension is
          <b>less</b> when the blocks are accelerating than when
          they are at rest with block 2 hanging freely.
        </p>

        <b>Question 2</b>. So far, we have always assumed the pulley's
        mass to be zero. Does the tension in the string change when
        the pulley's mass is changed?  Find the answer
        "experimentally", using the applet.
	</p>
        <p>
          <b>Experiment 1</b>. Reset the applet. Use the pulley-mass
          slider, the one illustrated on the right in Figure 4
          below, to set the pulley's mass <i>M</i> to 1.00 kg. This
          will make the pulley's moment of inertia, <i>I</i>, equal
          to 0.125 kg m<sup>2</sup>. Check this in the Data box.
        </p>

        </p>
	<p>
            Observe the tension while the blocks are still at rest.
            The pulley will then be at rest as well so that its
            inertial properties will not matter. Thus, the tension
            is the same, whether the pulley has mass or not. It is
            still equal to 3.9 N.
        </p>
	<p>
            <b>Experiment 2</b>. Click PLAY and then PAUSE the motion
            at some point.  Note the values of <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>
            and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> displayed by the applet. You
            should find <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> = 1.6 N and
            <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> = 2.9 N. Thus, the tensions are not
            equal on the two sides of the pulley, and neither value is
            equal to the 2.4 N observed when the pulley's mass is
            zero.
	</p>
            <p>
              The reason why the tensions must be different on the
              two sides of the pulley is that the string must apply
              a net torque on the pulley to accelerate the pulley's
              clockwise rotation. When the pulley's inertia is not
              zero, this net torque must be unequal to zero as
              well.
