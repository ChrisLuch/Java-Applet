      <b>Terminology</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Distinguish between <i>electric potential</i> and
        <i>electric potential difference</i>. In the context of
        electric circuits, one often emits "electric" and speaks
        more briefly of <i>potential</i> and <i>potential
        difference</i>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Electric potential</b> is a quantity that is defined
          at any given point in a circuit. It is analogous to
          elevation when walking in the mountains. Just as every
          point on a trail has a specific elevation, so does every
          point in a circuit have a specific electric potential.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Electric potential difference</b> is the difference
          between the values of the electric potential at two
          points in a circuit. E.g., if the potential is equal to
          20 V at point A and equal to 12 V at point B, then the
          potential difference between the two points is 20 V - 12
          V = 8 V. Another word for electric potential difference
          is <i>voltage</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The notation for potential difference used in this Lesson
          is <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>. In many books,
          you will find that the symbol <i>V</i> is used for
          potential difference. However, using just <i>V</i> does
          not make it clear that a difference is involved, so here
          <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> will be used. Of
          course, "V" also denotes the SI-unit "volt" of potential
          and potential difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will use the symbol <font face=
          "symbol">D</font><i>V</i> to denote the <b>absolute
          value</b> of the potential difference, i.e., a positive
          quantity. Sometimes a change in potential can be
          negative. E.g., if one goes from a point A where the
          potential is 20 V to a point B where the potential is 8
          V, then the <b>change</b> in potential (later value minus
          earlier value) is 8 V - 20 V = -12 V. We will refer to
          this as <b>change in potential</b> and denote it by
          <i>V<sub>B</sub></i> - <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> = -12 V which
          leaves no uncertainty about the ordering.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          One talks about the potential difference (voltage)
          <b>across</b> a circuit element, e.g., across a light
          bulb, and the current <b>in</b> in the circuit element.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
	  <u>Definition of Resistance</u>. The <i>resistance R</i> of
        a circuit element (resistor, segment of wire, light bulb,
        etc.) is defined by the ratio
        </p> 
        <div class="equation">
          <i>R</i> = <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> /
          <i><font face="symbol">I</font></i> <img src="small.gif"
          alt="space" height="1" width="50"> (1)
        </div>
        <p>
          where <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> is the
          potential difference across the circuit element and
          <i><font face="symbol">I</font></i> is the current in the
          circuit element. Here, one takes both <font face=
          "symbol">D</font><i>V</i> and <i><font face=
          "symbol">I</font></i> to be positive so that resistance
          is by definition a positive quantity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SI-unit of resistane is the <i>ohm</i> (symbol:
          <font face="symbol">W</font>; this is the capital Greek
          letter 'omega', but it is pronounced 'ohm' in this case).
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Example</u>: The resistance of a circuit element that
          has a potential difference of 100 V across it and a
          current of 2 A in it is
        </p>
        <div class="equation">
          <i>R</i> = 100/2 = 50 <font face="symbol">W</font>.

          (2)
        </div>
        <p>
          <u>Comment</u>. Often the equation <font face=
          "symbol">D</font><i>V</i> / <i><font face=
          "symbol">I</font></i> = <i>R</i> is referred to as Ohm's
          Law. This equation, however, is merely the definition of
          resistance, <b>not</b> Ohm's Law. Ohm's Law is the
          statement that <i>R</i> as given by this equation is a
          constant under specified conditions. See below. The
          definition of <i>R</i> by this equation applies whether
          or not <i>R</i> is a constant.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Ohm's Law</u>. At a fixed temperature, the resistance of
        a metal is independent of the current. 
        <p>
          <u>Comment 1</u>. One says that a circuit element obeys
          Ohm's Law if the potential difference across the element
          and the current in the element are proportional to each
          other. In other words, a circuit element obeys Ohm's Law
          if its resistance is independent of the current in the
          element.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 2</u>. The resistance of a light bulb varies a
          great deal with the current in the bulb, because the
          temperature of the tungsten filament in the bulb
          increases a great deal as the current increases. In the
          accompanying applet, it is assumed that the resistance of
          any light bulb (or of any resistor) is the same under all
          conditions. In other words, it is assumed that the light
          bulbs in the applet obey Ohm's law. This is quite
          unrealistic, but to do anything else would only introduce
          an unnessary complication for the purpose at hand.

        <p>
          <u>Note about the emf and internal resistance of a
          battery</u>. The emf of a battery is equal to the voltage
          between the battery's terminals when there is no current
          in the battery. When a battery is fully charged and the
          current in the battery is not excessive, the battery's
          terminal voltage will be very close to the battery's emf.
          In this Lesson we will assume that this is always the
          case. The difference between the emf and the terminal
          voltage depends on the internal resistance of the
          battery. As a battery gets more and more discharged, its
          internal resistance increases (its emf remains unchanged)
          and, as a result, its terminal voltage decreases for a
          given current in the battery.

      Figure 3 shows a junction in an electric circuit at which
      three branches are joined. Positive directions have been
      defined in the branches. They are indicated by arrows. A
      current has a positive value if its direction coincides with
      the positive direction in the branch where the current is.
      The branches in the diagram above are labeled 1 to 3, and the
      currents in the branches will be labeled <i>I<sub>1</sub></i>
      to <i>I<sub>3</sub></i>, accordingly.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Kirchhoff's Junction Rule (Current Law) says that the sum of
      the currents entering a junction is equal to the sum of the
      currents leaving the junction. 
      <p>
        In the case of the situation in Figure 1, this amounts to
      </p>
      <p class="equation">
        <i>I<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>I<sub>2</sub></i> =
        <i>I<sub>3</sub></i>. <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
        height="1" width="30"> (6)
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      For the purpose of this rule, a current is considered to be
      entering (leaving) the junction if the direction assigned to
      the branch in which the current is points to (away from) the
      junction. In our example, currents 1 and 2 are entering the
      junction and current 3 is leaving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real directions of the currents may be different from
      what this terminology suggests. E.g., current 1 may be
      directed to the left, i.e., away from the junction. We will
      still treat the current as if it were entering the junction,
      but will assign it a negative value because its direction is
      opposite to that defined as positive by the arrows in branch
      1. The direction of the arrows is a matter of choice, not
      fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      In writing down the junction equation, one assumes that all
      currents are in the positive directions. The resulting
      equation will be correct, no matter what the actual current
      directions are, as long as the currents are given the
      appropriate sign.

      current <i>I</i><sub>1</sub>. Currents go from high to low
      potential. (We are assuming the conventional current
      direction.) The magnitude of the potential difference across
      resistor <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> is equal to
      <i>R</i><sub>1</sub><i>I</i><sub>1</sub>. Since the potential
      is decreasing in the direction of the current, the potential
      difference in going from A to B is
      -<i>R</i><sub>1</sub><i>I</i><sub>1</sub>. In branch 2 we are
      moving against the current. Therefore the potential changee
      in going across <i>R</i><sub>2</sub> is
      +<i>R</i><sub>2</sub><i>I</i><sub>2</sub> because the
      potential is increasing in going against the current.
      Finally, in going from C to A we are crossing the battery
      from the negative to the positive pole and therefore are
      gaining a potential difference of +12 V.

      <a name="Exercise2"></a><b>Exercise 2 (A Circuit With Two
      Parallel Branches)</b>. Construct the circuit from Figure 1
      above as follows. If you did Exercise 1, you already have a
      circuit containing the 10-V battery and the bulb with design
      voltage and power equal to 10 V and 20 W, respectively. Add
      the parallel loop using only wires at first. This will result
      in a short circuit in the entire circuit except for the link
      containing the bulb. Insert both an open switch and a
      10-<font face="symbol">W</font> resistor into the parallel
      loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. What is the potential difference across
      the open switch? Try to reason out the answer first. Then
      determine it experimentally using the applet, either by
      displaying the potential at a grid point on either side of
      the switch (by selecting the Select Tool and clicking on the
      grid point) or by connecting a voltmeter in parallel with the
      switch.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The potential difference across the open
      switch is equal to the battery terminal voltage, i.e, 10 V.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reason: Since there is no current in the branch containing
      the open circuit, the potential difference across the
      resistor is 0. (By Equation (1), this potential difference is
      equal to <i>R</i> <i>I</i>, and this product is 0 because
      <i>I</i> = 0.) Kirchhoff's loop rule applied to the large
      loop containing the battery, switch, and resistor, starting
      at the bottom left corner of the loop below the battery,
      going clockwise through the switch and resistor and returning
      to the bottom left corner of the looop, gives
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      -10 V + <i>X</i> + 0 = 0 .<img src="small.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="50"> (10)
    </p>
    <p>
      -10 V is the potential difference encountered in crossing the
      battery from below to above the battery, <i>X</i> is the
      potential difference encountered in crossing the switch from
      left to right, and 0 is the potential difference encountered
      in crossing the resistor. The potential differences across
      the wire elements are zero as well because there is no
      current in these elements. They would be neglible even with
      current because the resistances of the wire elements are very
      small.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solving Equation (10) for <i>X</i> gives <i>X</i> = 10 V.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. If the switch is closed, will the light
      bulb
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        burn brighter,
      </li>
      <li>
        burn equally bright,
      </li>
      <li>
        burn less bright?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Try to reason out the answer before checking it with the
      applet. Note that the brightness of the bulb increases with
      the current in the bulb. Therefore, Question 2 could be
      rephrased in terms of whether there will be more or less
      current in the bulb when the switch is closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Closing the switch does <b>not</b> affect the
      brightness of the bulb. The reason is that closing the switch
      does not change the potential difference across the bulb and
      therefore does not change the current in the bulb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, Kirchhoff's loop rule explains why the potential
      difference across the bulb is unaffected by the setting of
      the switch. Let's consider the small loop this time, the loop
      containing only the battery and the bulb. Let <i>Y</i> denote
      the potential change in going from the top of the bulb to the
      bottom of the bulb. Then going around the small loop starting
      at the bottom left corner, up through the battery, down
      through the bulb, and back to the bottom left corner and
      adding potential changes gives
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      -10 V + <i>Y</i> = 0 .<img src="small.gif" alt="space"
         height="1" width="50"> (11)
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, <i>Y</i> = 10 V. This argument is unaffected by whether
      there is a parallel branch containing another resistor and
      whether the switch is open or closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 3</b>. What is the potential difference across
      the switch when the switch is closed? Try to reason out the
      answer. Then check it with the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The potential difference across the switch is
      negligible when the switch is closed. The reason is that the
      switch has negligible resistance when it is closed. Thus, the
      potential difference across the switch, which is equal to the
      product of the current in the switch and the resistance of
      the switch, is negligible also.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 4</b>. What is the current in the switch when the
      switch is closed? Try to work out the answer before
      determining it by using the applet. (Insert an ammeter into
      the branch containing the switch.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The current in the switch is equal to 1.0 A.
      Reason: The current in the switch is equal to the current in
      the 10-<font face="symbol">W</font> resistor. The current can
      be calculated by applying Definition (1) of resistance to
      this resistor. The potential difference across the resistor
      is 10 V, by an argument analogous to that leading to Equation
      (10) in Question 1 above. Thus,

      <b>Question 1</b>. What is the current in the
         15-<font face="symbol">W</font> and 10-<font face=
         "symbol">W</font> resistors? Try to reason out the answer
         before measuring the current with the applet by inserting
         an ammeter in series with the two resistors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The current is 0.4 A.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reason: Since the two resistors are in series, there is the
      same current in both of them. The in-series combination of
      the two resistors is in parallel with the light bulb. Thus
      both have the same potential difference across them, which is
      10 V. See Question 2 in Exercise 2. By Equation (4), the
      combined resistance <i>R<sub>ser</sub></i> of the two
      resistors in series is
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>R<sub>ser</sub></i> = 10 + 15 = 25 <font face=

    </p>
    <p>
      With these values, Definition (1) applied to
      <i>R<sub>ser</sub></i> gives for the current
            <i><font face="symbol">I</font><sub>ser</sub></i> in
            both resistances the value
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i><font face="symbol">I</font><sub>ser</sub></i> =
      <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> / <i>R<sub>ser</sub></i>
      = 10 / 25 = 0.4 A .<img src="small.gif" alt="space"
         height="1" width="30"> (14)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. What is the current in the battery? Again,
      try to reason out the answer before measuring the value by
      inserting an ammeter into the circuit next to the battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. One approach is to use Equation (14), but with
      <i>R<sub>tot</sub></i> instead of <i>R<sub>ser</sub></i>
      where <i>R<sub>tot</sub></i> is the total resistance of the
      circuit outside the battery. Since <i>R<sub>tot</sub></i>
      results from the in-parallel combination of the
         5-<font face="symbol">W</font> resistance of the bulb and
         the 25-<font face="symbol">W</font> in-series combination
         of the two resistors, we need to apply Equation (5) which
         gives
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      1 / <i>R<sub>tot</sub></i> = 1/5 + 1/25 = 6/25 <img src=
      "small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="30"> (15)
    </p>whence 
    <p align="center">
      <i>R<sub>tot</sub></i> = 25/6 <font face="symbol">W</font> .
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="50"> (16)
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the battery terminal voltage of 10 V is equal to the
      potential difference across the total resistance external to
      the battery, the analogue of Equation (14) gives for the
      current <i><font face="symbol">I</font><sub>bat</sub></i> in
      the battery the value
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i><font face="symbol">I</font><sub>bat</sub></i> = 10 /
      (25/6) = 60 / 25 = 2.4 A .<img src="small.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="30"> (17)
    </p>
    <p>
      One can check this result independently by applying
      Kirchhoff's junction rule to the junction below the bulb. The
      current &gt;<i><font face="symbol">I</font></i> from the
      battery is entering this junction, and the 2-A current
      through the bulb and the 0.4-A current through the two
      resistors is leaving the junction. Therefore, Kirchhoff's
      junction rule confirms result (17),
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i><font face="symbol">I</font><sub>bat</sub></i> = 2.0 + 0.4
      = 2.4 A .<img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
         width="30"> (18)
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to check this result is by considering powers.
      According to Equation (3b), the power put into the circuit by
      the battery is equal to 10 V &times; <i><font face=
      "symbol">I</font><sub>bat</sub></i> where
            <i><font face="symbol">I</font><sub>bat</sub></i> is
            the current in the battery and 10 V is the battery emf.
            By energy conservation, this must be equal to the total
            power dissipated in the circuit. The combined power
            dissipated in the bulb and the in-series combination of
            the two resistors, by Equations (3a), is

      <b>Answer to Question 1</b>. When the switch is closed, bulb
      1 will burn brighter and bulb 2 less bright than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reason: When the switch is open, bulbs 1 and 2 are in
      parallel and have a combined resistance of <i>R</i> +
      <i>R</i> = 2<i>R</i>. There is a potential difference across
      them equal to the battery voltage of <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>.

      When the switch is closed, bulbs 2 and 3 are in parallel.
      Therefore, their combined resistance <i>R<sub>||</sub></i>,
      is determined by the equation

      This combined resistance of <i>R</i> / 2 is in series with
      the resistance <i>R</i> of bulb 1. Therefore, the combined
      resistance <i>R<sub>tot</sub></i> of all three bulbs is

      The current <i><font face=

      arrangement when the switch is closed is given by
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i><font face="symbol">I</font><sub>closed</sub></i> =
      <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> / 1.5<i>R</i> = 0.67
      <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> / <i>R</i> . <img src="small.gif"

      This current is larger than the current through bulb 1 when
      the switch is open, given by Equation (21). Thus, bulb 1
      burns brighter when the switch is closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current (25) in bulb 1 is split into two equal halves (by
      Kirchhoff's junction rule and symmetry) when entering the
      parallel arrangement of bulbs 2 and 3. Thus, both of these
      bulbs each have a current equal to 0.33 <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>
      / <i>R</i>. For bulb 2, this current is less than current
      (21) which it had when the switch was open. Therefore, bulb 2
      burns less bright when the switch is closed.

      <b>Answer to Question 2</b>. The arrangement of resistors in
      Figure 4 can be redrawn as shown in Figure 9 below.

      Figure 5 shows clearly that the three resistors are in
      parallel.

      You can check this by following the various possible paths
      through the resistors in Figures 4 and 5. You can also check
      this with the applet by constructing both arrangements, the
      ones in Figures 4 and 5, and separately connecting each to a
      10-V battery. Give the resistances 10 <font face=
      "symbol">W</font> each. The applet will let you construct
      both circuits in the same applet window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both circuits should behave in the same manner electrically.
      E.g., the current in the battery entering the arrangement of
      resistors should be the same in both cases. Since a parallel
      arrangement of three 10-<font face="symbol">W</font>
      resistors has a combined resistance of 10/3 <font face=
      "symbol">W</font>, this current should be equal to 10 V /
      (10/3 <font face="symbol">W</font>) = 3 A.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could also interrupt the circuits in strategic locations
      by means of switches and check if the circuits behave
      identically if the switches are placed in corresponding
      locations.
