      The applet lets you build an electric circuit containing
      batteries, resistors, light bulbs, switches, ammeters,
      voltmeters, and calculates currents, potentials, and powers
      dissipated in the circuit.

      The applet takes the resistance of any wire segment between
      two adjoining grid points to be unequal to zero. The fixed
      value for this resistance is 1&times;10<sup>-9</sup>
      <font face="symbol">W</font>. This value is negligibly small
      in most, but not all situations. Textbooks usually take the
      resistance of wires to be zero, to simplify the calculations.
      For most circuits constructed with the applet, you may take
      the resistance of the wires in the circuit to be zero in your
      calculations without making a noticeable error.
