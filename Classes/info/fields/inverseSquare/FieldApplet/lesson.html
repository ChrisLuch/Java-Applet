<p><div class="sectionheading">The Applet simulates the gravitational
 field outside and inside a sphere of uniform mass density and, in
 another mode, the electric field outside and inside a sphere of
 uniform charge density. </div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p><b>Prerequisites</b>

<p>Students should be somewhat familiar with Newton's universal law of
gravitation and, those who want to use the applet in the electric
mode, with the concept of charge and Coulomb's law of electrostatics.
They should be familiar with Newton's second law of motion.

<p><b>Learning Outcomes</b>

<p>Students will be introduced to the definitions of the gravitational
and the electric field and will develop an understanding of the
characteristics of the gravitational field of a uniform spherical mass
distribution and of the electric field of a uniform spherical charge
distribution, both outside and inside the distribution.

<p><b>Instructions</b>

<p>Students should know how the applet functions, as described in Help and
ShowMe.

<p>The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in the
following text are to be done in the applet. You may need to toggle
back and forth between instructions and applet if your screen space is
limited.

 <p><li><a name="Theorem"><b>Theorem on Forces Exerted by Spheres</b></a>  

 <p>Both Newton's law of gravitation and Coulomb's law of electrostatics
 describe forces that two <b>point</b> particles exert on each other.
 A spherical object is not a point particle and, therefore, neither of
 these laws directly gives the force exerted by a spherical object
 on a (point) particle.  However, one can prove the following theorems which
 assume uniform mass or charge distributions throughout the spherical
 object.

 <p>The force has a different dependence on the distance <i>d</i> when
 the particle is outside the sphere, <i>d</i> > <i>R</i>, or when the
 particle is inside a small cavity inside the sphere, <i>d</i> <
 <i>R</i>.

 <p><u>Gravitational Force</u>. The gravitational force exerted on a
 particle of mass <i>m</i> by a sphere of uniform mass density and
 total mass <i>M</i> and radius <i>R</i> has a magnitude <i>W</i>
 given by

 <p><u><i>d</i> > <i>R</i></u>:<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="60"><i>W</i> = <i>GMm</i> / <i>d</i><sup>2</sup> =
 <i>GMm</i>/<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>)<sup>2</sup>.<img
 src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (6)</p>

 <p><u><i>d</i> < <i>R</i></u>:<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="60"><i>W</i> = <i>GMm</i>/<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>
 (<i>d</i>/<i>R</i>) .<img src="small.gif" height="1" width="40">
 (7)</p>

 <p>Either one of these expressions has the same limit for
 <i>d</i> = <i>R</i>, i.e., when the particle is at the surface of the
 spherical object,

 <p><u><i>d</i> = <i>R</i></u>:<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="60"><i>W</i> = <i>GMm</i> / <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>.<img
 src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (8)

 <p><u>Comment 1</u>. When the particle is outside the sphere,
 <i>d</i> > <i>R</i>, the sphere acts like at point particle of mass
 <i>M</i> at the center of the sphere.

 <p><u>Comment 2</u>. When the particle is inside the sphere, <i>d</i>
 < <i>R</i>, the sphere does <b>not</b> act like a point particle.
 <i>W</i> decreases as one approaches the center of the sphere in
 proportion to the distance <i>d</i> from the sphere.  

 <p>To imagine the situation when the particle is inside the sphere,
 think of a small cavity inside the sphere.  If the cavity is very
 small compared to the sphere, the change in the force <i>W</i>
 resulting from the removal of matter to create the cavity is
 negligible.

 <p><u>Comment 3</u>. If the spherical object is the earth or some
 other large astronomical body, the quantity <i>W</i> is called the
 <i>weight</i> of the particle due to the earth or that body.

 <p><u>Comment 4</u>. Let us denote the factor
 <i>GM</i>/<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> in Expressions (6) to (8) by
 <i>g<sub>R</sub></i>,

 <p align="center"><i>g<sub>R</sub></i> =
 <i>GM</i>/<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>. <img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="40"> (9)</p>

 <p>For more information on <i>g<sub>R</sub></i>, see Comment 4 under
 "Gravitional Field" below.

 <p>In terms of the quantity <i>g<sub>R</sub></i>, Expressions (6) to
 (8) can be written as

 <p><u><i>d</i> > <i>R</i></u>:<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="60"><i>W</i> = <i>m</i><i>g<sub>R</sub></i>
 (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>)<sup>2</sup>.<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="40"> (10)</p>

 <p><u><i>d</i> < <i>R</i></u>:<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="60"><i>W</i> = <i>m</i><i>g<sub>R</sub></i>
 (<i>d</i>/<i>R</i>) .<img src="small.gif" height="1" width="40">
 (11)</p>

 <p><u><i>d</i> = <i>R</i></u>:<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="60"><i>W</i> = <i>m</i><i>g<sub>R</sub></i>.<img
 src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (12) 

 <p><u>Electrostatic Force</u>. The electrostatic force exerted on a
 particle of charge <i>q</i> by a sphere of uniform charge density and
 total charge <i>Q</i> and radius <i>R</i> has a magnitude <i>F</i>
 given by

 <p><u><i>d</i> > <i>R</i></u>:<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="60"><i>F</i> = <i>k|Q||q|</i> / <i>d</i><sup>2</sup> =
 <i>k|Q||q|</i>/<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>
 (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>)<sup>2</sup>.<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="40"> (13)</p>

 <p><u><i>d</i> < <i>R</i></u>:<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="60"><i>F</i> = <i>k|Q||q|</i>/<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>
 (<i>d</i>/<i>R</i>) .<img src="small.gif" height="1" width="40">
 (14)</p>

 <p>Either one of these expressions has the same limit for
 <i>d</i> = <i>R</i>, i.e., when the particle is at the surface of the
 spherical object,

 <p><u><i>d</i> = <i>R</i></u>:<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="60"><i>F</i> = <i>k|Q||q|</i> / <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>.<img
 src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (15)

 <p><u>Comment 5</u>. When the particle is outside the sphere,
 <i>d</i> > <i>R</i>, the sphere acts like at point particle of charge
 <i>Q</i> at the center of the sphere.

 <p><u>Comment 6</u>. When the particle is inside the sphere, <i>d</i>
 < <i>R</i>, the sphere does <b>not</b> act like a point particle.
 <i>F</i> decreases as one approaches the center of the sphere in
 proportion to the distance <i>d</i> from the sphere.

 <p><li><a name="GravField"><b>Definition of Gravitational Field</b></a>

 <blockquote>If <img src="Wcap.gif" align="top"> is the
 gravitational force exerted on a test particle of mass <i>m</i> at
 some point in space, then the ratio

 <p align="center"><img src="g.gif" align="top"> = <img
 src="Wcap.gif" align="top"> / <i>m</i> <img src="small.gif"
 height="1" width="40"> (16)

 <p>is called the <i>gravitational field</i> at the given point.</blockquote>

 <p><u>Comment 1</u>.  Since the force <img src="Wcap.gif"
 align="top"> is proportional to the mass <i>m</i>, the gravitational
 field <img src="g.gif" align="top"> is independent of <i>m</i> and
 characterizes a "gravitational intensity" at the given point in space
 that is present without the test particle and does not depend on any
 properties of the test particle.

<p><u>Comment 2</u>.  The SI-unit of the gravitational field is N/kg.

 <p><u>Comment 3</u>.  The gravitational field <img src="g.gif"
 align="top"> at a given point is a vector equal to the
 acceleration due to gravity of a test particle at that point.  The
 reason is as follows.

 <p>If only the gravitational force <img src="Wcap.gif" align="top">
 is acting on the test particle, then Newton's second law applied to
 the particle gives the following equation for the acceleration <img
 src="a.gif" align="bottom"> of the particle:

 <p align="center"><img src="Wcap.gif" align="bottom"> = <i>m</i> <img
 src="a.gif" align="bottom"> <img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="40">(17)</p>

 <p>whence

 <p align="center"><img src="a.gif" align="bottom"> = <img src="Wcap.gif"
 align="bottom"> / <i>m</i> .<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="40">(18)

 <p>Comparing the right-hand sides of Eqs.(16) and (18) shows that the
 particle's acceleration, the <i>acceleration due to gravity</i>, is
 equal to the gravitational field <img src="g.gif" align="bottom"> at the
 location of the particle.

 <p>There is only one "acceleration due to gravity", equal to the one
 gravitational field.  All particles have the same acceleration due to
 gravity.  This was already noted by Galileo who stated that all
 particles fall equally fast if they are not impeded by air
 resistance.

 <p>Keep in mind, that the acceleration due to gravity is not a
 constant but varies with location, just like <img src="g.gif"
 align="top">.  It is approximately constant in a small enough range
 near the surface of the earth.

 <p><u>Comment 4</u>.  The acceleration due to gravity or the
 gravitational field at the surface of the sphere,
 <i>g<sub>R</sub></i>, has a value close to 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup> if
 the sphere is the earth.

 <p><u>Comment 5</u>.  The gravitational field is defined at all
 points in space.  It is therefore not a single vector, but a
 "vector-valued function defined on space".  This simply means that to
 describe the gravitational field one must specify the vectors <img
 src="g.gif" align="top"> at all points in space.</li>

  <p><u>Gravitational case</u>

  <p>If the applet is not in the Gravitational mode, select that mode
  and RESET the applet.

  <p><b>Task 1</b>.  Under "Laws, Theorems, Definitions"                                   
  above, read 

  <p><ul>

  <li>the section on "Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation",</li>

  <li>the subsection "Gravitational Force" of "Theorem on Forces
  Exerted by Spheres",</li>

  <li>the section on "Definition of Gravitational Field".</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>

  <p>Derive an expression for the magnitude <i>g</i> of the
  gravitational field due to a sphere of uniform mass density and total
  mass <i>M</i> at a distance <i>d</i> from the center of the sphere,
  if the field point is outside the sphere.  

  <p>What is the direction of the field vector at this point?

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  Taking magnitudes on both sides of Definition
  (16) and substituting Expression (6) or (10) for <i>W</i> gives the
  following three expressions for <i>g</i>:

 <p><u><i>d</i> > <i>R</i></u>:<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="60"><i>g</i> = <i>GM</i> / <i>d</i><sup>2</sup> =
 <i>GM</i>/<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>)<sup>2</sup> =
 <i>g<sub>R</sub></i> (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>)<sup>2</sup>.<img
 src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (20)</p>
  
  <p>The direction of the field vector <img src="g.gif" align="bottom">
  is towards the center of the sphere.

  <p><b>Exercise 2</b>
  
  <p>In the applet's default setting, the values for the radius and
  the mass of the source object are the same as those for the earth:

  <p><img src="small.gif" heigt="1" width="20"><i>R</i> =
  6.38&times;10<sup>6</sup> m,

  <p><img src="small.gif" heigt="1" width="20"><i>M</i> =
  5.98&times;10<sup>24</sup> kg.

  <p>Check that the sliders and the Data box display these values.</li>

  <p>Observe the magnitude <i>g</i> of the gravitational field shown
  in the Data box and the length and direction of the green arrow
  representing the field vector when the field point is as close to
  the surface of the source object as you can make it.

  <p>What value would you expect for <i>g</i>?  Calculate this value
  using the first one in the series of Expressions (20).

  <p><b>Exercise 3</b>

  <p>Drag the field point to a point where <i>d</i> = 2<i>R</i>, as
  closely as you can, and observe the value of <i>g</i> at this
  point and the length and direction of the field vector.

  <p>At <i>d</i> = 2<i>R</i> = 1.28&times;10<sup>7</sup> m, you should
  find <i>g</i> = 2.45 m/s<sup>2</sup>.

  <p>When comparing this value to the value of <i>g</i> at <i>d</i> =
  <i>R</i>, is the dependence of <i>g</i> on <i>d</i> consistent with
  a 1/<i>d</i> law or a 1/<i>d</i><sup>2</sup> law?  Check your answer
  by increasing the Field Scale setting by the appropriate factor
  (what factor should it be?) so that the green arrow at this new
  scale setting has the same length that it had at <i>d</i> =
  <i>R</i>.

  <p><b>Exercise 4</b>

  <p>Repeat Exercise 3 for <i>d</i> = 3<i>R</i>.  You may have to move
  the source object to be able to achieve <i>d</i> = 3<i>R</i>.

  <p><b>Question 1</b>

  <p>Take the mass of the sun to be 1.99&times;10<sup>30</sup> kg, and
  calculate the magnitude of the average acceleration due to gravity
  experienced by the earth as it orbits the sun.  Take the average
  radius of the earth's orbit to be 1.50&times;10<sup>11</sup> m.

  <p>Check your answer with the applet.  You will have to give the sun
  an unrealistically large radius in order to have a visible source
  object on the screen while adjusting the distance <i>d</i>.  As long
  as the radius of the sun is smaller than the earth's orbital radius,
  it will have no effect on the answer.  Why not?

  <p>Compare your result with that of the magnitude of the
  acceleration due to gravity due to the earth on the surface of the
  earth.

  <p><u>Electric case</u>

  <p>If the applet is not in the Electric mode, select that mode
  and RESET the applet.

  <p><b>Task 2</b>.  Under "Laws, Theorems, Definitions"

  </ul>

  <p><b>Exercise 5</b>

  <p>Derive an expression for the magnitude <i>E</i> of the
  electric field due to a sphere of uniform charge density and total
  charge <i>Q</i> at a distance <i>d</i> from the center of the sphere,
  if the field point is outside the sphere.  

  <p>What is the direction of the field vector at this point?  Vary
  the sign of the source charge.

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  Taking magnitudes on both sides of Definition
  (19) and substituting Expressions (13) for <i>F</i> gives the
  following two expressions for <i>E</i>:

 <p><u><i>d</i> > <i>R</i></u>:<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="60"><i>E</i> = <i>k|Q|</i> / <i>d</i><sup>2</sup> =
 <i>k|Q|</i>/<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>)<sup>2</sup>.<img
 src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (21)</p>
  
  <p>The direction of the field vector <img src="E.gif" align="bottom">
  is towards the center of the sphere if <i>Q</i> is negative and away
  from the center of the sphere if <i>Q</i> is positive.

  <p><b>Exercise 6</b>
  
  <p>In the default setting, the values for the radius and the charge of
  the source object are those appropriate for the electron:

  <p><img src="small.gif" heigt="1" width="20"><i>R</i> =
  2.82&times;10<sup>-15</sup> m,

  <p><img src="small.gif" heigt="1" width="20"><i>Q</i> =
  -1.60&times;10<sup>-19</sup> C.

  <p>Reset these values to 

  <p><img src="small.gif" heigt="1" width="20"><i>R</i> =
  1.00&times;10<sup>-15</sup> m,
                                                                                                    
  <p><img src="small.gif" heigt="1" width="20"><i>Q</i> =
  1.60&times;10<sup>-19</sup> C

  <p>which apply approximately to the proton.  The proton's "radius"
  is measured to be slightly smaller than 1.0&times;10<sup>-15</sup>
  m.  Note that such radius measurements are made by bombarding the
  proton with either electrons or protons and that what one may want
  to define as a "radius" is a quantity that depends on the nature of
  the interaction of such probes with the proton.  Also note that an
  electron "radius" has not been observed in similar experiments and
  that the "electron radius" to which the applet is set is the
  so-called "classical electron radius" which is a theoretical
  quantity that merely has this name and does not describe a real
  electron radius.

  <p>Record the magnitude <i>E</i> of the electric field displayed
  in the Data box and the length and direction of the green arrow
  representing the field vector when the field point is as close to
  the surface of the source object as you can make it.

  <p>Calculate this value using Expression (21).  Compare the value to
  that for an electric field that you might encounter in a laboratory,
  e.g., the magnitude of the field between the plates of a
  parallel-plate capacitor whose plates are 1 mm apart and which has a
  voltage of 10 V across the plates.  (For a parallel-plate capacitor,
  <i>E</i> = <i>V</i>/<i>d</i>, where <i>V</i> is the voltage across
  the plates in volt and <i>d</i> the separation in meter.  The answer
  will be in V/m which is the same as N/C.)

  <p><b>Exercise 7</b>

  <p>Repeat Exercises 3 and 4 for the electric case.

  <p><b>Question 2</b>.  What is the magnitude of the electric field
  due to a hydrogen atom's nucleus (proton) sensed by the electron in
  the atom's lowest orbit, which is a circle of radius
  5.3&times;10<sup>-11</sup> m?

  <p>Again, compare the magnitude of this field to that of a typical
  laboratory field.

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>

  <p>Derive an expression for the magnitude <i>g</i> of the

  if the field point is inside the sphere.  

  <p>What is the direction of the field vector at this point?

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  Taking magnitudes on both sides of Definition
  (16) and substituting Expression (7) or (11) for <i>W</i> gives the
  following two expressions for <i>g</i>:

  <i>R</i>/3, and observe the changes in the magnitude and direction
  of the electric field vector.

  <p>You should find <i>E</i> to be equal to 9.80/4 m/s<sup>2</sup>
  and 9.80/9 m/s<sup>2</sup>, respectively. 

  <p>Verify that this is the case by increasing the Field Scale
  setting by factors of 4 and 9, respectively.  This should result in
  green arrows whose lenghts are equal in pixel to the length of the
  arrow at <i>d</i> = <i>R</i> when using the original Field Scale
  setting.

  <p>The direction of the field vector should always be towards the
  center of the source object.

  <p><b>Question 1</b>.  What value do you expect for <i>g</i> at the
  center of the source object?

  <p>Can you explain why <i>g</i> should be zero at <i>d</i> = 0 in
  terms of the superposition of the contributions to the gravitational
  field at the center of the source from all mass elements distributed
  throughout the source?

  <p><u>Electric case</u>

  <p>If the applet is not in the Electric mode, select that mode
  and RESET the applet.

  <p><b>Exercise 3</b>

  <p>Derive an expression for the magnitude <i>E</i> of the
  electric field due to a sphere of uniform charge density and total
  charge <i>Q</i> at a distance <i>d</i> from the center of the sphere,
  if the field point is inside the sphere.  

  <p>What is the direction of the field vector at this point?

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  Taking magnitudes on both sides of Definition
  (19) and substituting Expression (14) for <i>F</i> gives the
  following expression for <i>E</i>:

 <p><u><i>d</i> < <i>R</i></u>:<img src="small.gif" height="1"
 width="60"><i>E</i> = <i>k|Q|</i> / <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>
 (<i>d</i>/<i>R</i>).<img src="small.gif" height="1" width="40">
 (23)</p>
  
  <p>The direction of the field vector <img src="E.gif" align="top">
  is towards the center of the sphere if the source charge is
  negative, away from the center of the sphere if the source charge is
  positive.

  <p><b>Exercise 4</b>

  <p>Again, set the radius and charge of the source object to

  <p><img src="small.gif" heigt="1" width="20"><i>R</i> =
  1.00&times;10<sup>-15</sup> m,

  <p><img src="small.gif" heigt="1" width="20"><i>Q</i> =
  1.60&times;10<sup>-19</sup> C,

  <p>and drag the field point to as close to the surface of the source
  object as you can.

  <p>Record the magnitude <i>E</i> of the electric field shown in the
  Data box, and observe the length and direction of the green field
  vector.

  <p><i>E</i> should be equal to the value calculated in Exercise 6
  under "Field Outside the Source" above, namely, <i>E</i> =
  1.44&times;10<sup>21</sup> N/C.

  <p><li>Move the field point to <i>d</i> = <i>R</i>/2 and <i>d</i> =
  <i>R</i>/3, and observe the changes in the magnitude and direction
  of the electric field vector.

  <p>You should find the value of <i>E</i> to be equal to 1/4 and 1/9,
  respectively, times that at <i>d</i> = <i>R</i>. The direction of
  the field vector should always be away from the center of the source
  object if the source charge is positive.

  <p>Verify that this is the case by increasing the Field Scale
  setting by factors of 4 and 9, respectively.  This should result in
  green arrows whose lenghts are equal in pixel to the length of the
  arrow at <i>d</i> = <i>R</i> when using the original Field Scale
  setting.

  <p><b>Exercise 5</b>

  <p>Reverse the sign of the source charge from positive to  negative,
  but make no other changes.  What happens to the electric field
  vector?

  <p>Compare the directions of the field vector in the gravitational
  case for positive mass and in the electric case for positive charge.
  Are they the same?
