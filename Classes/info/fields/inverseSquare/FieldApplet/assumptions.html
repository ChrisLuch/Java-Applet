<div class="title">Assumptions - Inverse Square Law</div>

<p><div class="sectionheading">The Applet simulates the gravitational
 field outside and inside a sphere of uniform mass density and, in
 another mode, the electric field outside and inside a sphere of
 uniform charge density. </div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">



    <p>The applet makes the following assumptions:

	 <p><ul>

	 <li>The source object, i.e., the object responsible for the
	 existence of the field (either electric or gravitational) is
	 perfectly spherical with a radius <i>R</i>.</li>

	 <li>The source object's mass density (or charge density) is
	 uniform throughout the object.</li>

	 </ul>

	 <p>A consequence of the first two assumptions is that the
	 magnitude of the field (either electric or gravitational)
	 accompanying the source object has the following dependence on the
	 distance <i>d</i> of the field point from the center of the
	 source:

	 <p><ul>

	 <li>outside the source object: proportional to
	 1/<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>,</li>

	 <li>inside the source object: proportional to <i>d</i>.</li>

	 </ul>
