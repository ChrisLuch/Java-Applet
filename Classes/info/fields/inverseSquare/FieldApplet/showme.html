      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset"
      align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the applet is not in the Gravitational mode, select that
      mode and then RESET the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the default setting, the values for the radius and the
      mass of the source object are those appropriate for the
      earth:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "20"><i>R</i> = 6.38&times;10<sup>6</sup> m,
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="20"><i>M</i> =
      5.98&times;10<sup>24</sup> kg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verify that the Radius and Mass sliders are set to these
      values and that these values are displayed in the Data box as
      well. To display the Data box, select the Data box button
      <img src="Data.gif" alt="Data" align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Move the mouse pointer onto the field
      point, which is the point at which the tail end of the field
      vector is located. The mouse pointer should change from the
      four-directional crossed arrows to a cross-hair when it is
      near the field point and the field point can be dragged. Drag
      the field point to as close to the surface of the yellow
      source object as you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watch the value of <i>d</i> in the Data box. <i>d</i> is the
      distance of the field point from the center of the source
      object. Compare the value of <i>d</i> to that of <i>R</i>,
      the radius of the source object. Make them as equal as you
      can. Depending on where on the surface of the source object
      you are, you may be able to get <i>d</i> closer to <i>R</i>
      than elsewhere, because of round-off related to the
      pixel-graininess of the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the magnitude <i>g</i> of the gravitational field
      shown in the Data box and the length and direction of the
      green field vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>g</i> should be equal to 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup> or close to
      this value when <i>d</i> is equal to <i>R</i> or close to it,
      since the values for the radius and mass of the source object
      are those for the earth. The field vector should be pointing
      to the center of the source object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag the field point to a point where <i>d</i> = 2<i>R</i>,
      as closely as you can, and observe the value of <i>g</i> at
      this point and the length and direction of the field vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      At <i>d</i> = 2<i>R</i> = 1.28&times;10<sup>7</sup> m, the
      Data box should show <i>g</i> = 2.45 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. How does <i>g</i> vary as you increase
      <i>d</i>: is <i>g</i> proportional to 1/<i>d</i> or
      1/<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>?
    </p>
    <p>
      As you double <i>d</i>, does <i>g</i> get multiplied by 1/2
      or 1/2<sup>2</sup>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The magnitude of the gravitational field is
      proportional to 1/<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. How does the direction of the field vector
      vary as you move the field point?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. It should keep pointing to the center of the
      source object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Increase <i>d</i> to 3<i>R</i> by moving
      the source object while keeping the field point fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To move the source object, click anywhere inside the source
      object (except near the field point if that happens to be inside
      the source object) and drag the source object. When the mouse
      pointer has the appearance of four-directional crossed arrows
      <img src="Move.gif" alt="Move" align="top">, the source object
      can be dragged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 3</b>. Has <i>g</i> changed to the value you
      would expect and does the gravitational field vector keep
      pointing in the direction that you would expect, on the basis
      of your answers to Questions 1 and 2?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Repeat all of the above in the Electric
      mode, but note that the default values in that mode
      correspond to the electron,
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "20"><i>R</i> = 2.82&times;10<sup>-15</sup> m,
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "20"><i>Q</i> = -1.60&times;10<sup>-19</sup> C,
    </p>
    <p>
      and that the magnitude <i>E</i> of the electric field vector
      will have a different numerical value at the surface of the
      source object and will be in units of N/C, instead of N/kg as
      in the Gravitational mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment on the electron radius</u>. The value given above
      is the so-called "classical electron radius". This is a
      theoretical quantity that is not equal to any real electron
      radius. In the current quantum theory for the electron, which
      is consistent with experimental data on electron scattering,
      no such radius is defined. Thus, don't take the value of the
      electron radius given here literally, but simply as a small
      distance that is of the same order of magitude as the radius
      of the proton which does have some experimental basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Change the value of the source charge from
      -1.60 C to 1.60 C.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way to do that easily is to double-click on the charge
      slider. A dialog will open up that lets you enter the new
      value. Then press OK.
    </p>
    <p>
      The direction of the field vector should reverse, pointing
      outward for positive source charge. Also note the change in
      color of the source object, from blue to red.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 6</b>. Change the radius and the mass of the
      source object, and observe the resulting changes of the field
      vector. To change the slider settings, you can either drag
      the slider or double-click on the slider and enter the
      desired value in a dialog that will pop up. You can make fine
      adjustments to the slider settings by clicking in the slider
      groove to the right or left of the slider tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changing the radius should have no effect on the field vector
      as long as the field point is outside of the source object.
      For the case when the source object becomes so large that it
      includes the field point on its inside, see the following
      section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnitude of the field vector should vary in proportion
      to the mass of the source object.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. If the applet is not in the Gravitational
      mode, select that mode and RESET the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As done in the preceding section, drag the field point to as
      close to the surface of the yellow source object as you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the magnitude <i>g</i> of the gravitational field
      shown in the Data box and the length and direction of the
      green field vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>g</i> should be equal to 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup> or close to
      this value, since the values for the radius and mass of the
      source object are those for the earth. The field vector
      should be pointing to the center of the source object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Move the field point to <i>d</i> =
      <i>R</i>/2 and <i>d</i> = <i>R</i>/3, and observe the changes
      in the magnitude and direction of the gravitational field
      vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should find
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>g</i> = 9.80 / 2 m/s<sup>2</sup> = 4.90 m/s<sup>2</sup>

    </ul>
    <p>
      The direction of the field vector should always be towards
      the center of the source object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. What value do you expect for <i>g</i> at
      the center of the source object? Try it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Repeat all of the above in the Electric
      mode. Do you observe analogous behavior for the magnitude and
      direction of the electric field vector?
    </p>
    <p>
      For negative source charge, the field vector should always be
      pointing towards the center of the source, for positive
      source charge away from the center of the source.

      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the field point away from the source object to a point
      where the magnitude <i>g</i> of the gravitational field is
      1.50 N/kg or close to that value. The field vector will be
      represented at that point by a rather short arrow as in
      Figure 1 below.

      Change the setting of the power p of the Field Scale slider
      from -12 to -11. The easiest way to do this is to click once
      to the right of the tab of the p-slider of the Field Scale
      slider pair. As a result, the arrow representing the field
      vector will become 10 times longer than before and will look
      as in Figure 2 below. The value of <i>g</i> shown in the Data
      box will remain as 1.50 N/kg.

      Change the setting of the p-slider of the Field Scale slider

      the Field Scale slider pair from 2 to 3 to 4 to 5, by
      clicking to the right of the slider tab each time. Observe
      how the arrow representing the field slowly increases in
      length. Figure 3 below illustrates what you should see at the

      Note that none of the values displayed in the Data box change
      during these scale changes.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. With the Field Scale setting at

    <p>
      Both the radius in pixels of the source object and the
      distance in pixels of the field point from the center of the
      source object have been cut in half compared what they were
      in Figure 3. However, the length of the arrow representing
      the field vector has <b>not</b> changed. Neither have any of
      the values displayed in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. What value do you expect for <i>g</i> at
      the center of the source object? Try to find the answer
      "experimentally" with the applet as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Move the field point as close to the
      center of the source object as you can. Observe the values of
      <i>d</i> and <i>g</i> displayed in the Data box decrease as
      you do so. Both should become zero when you reach the center
      of the source object. However, getting exactly to the center
      may be difficult to do because of the pixel resolution of the
      screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make it easier to reach <i>d</i> = 0 and observe the field
      vector, keep increasing the Field Scale setting and the
      Length Scale setting as you approach the center of the source
      object. This will increase the pixel distance between field
      point and source center and the length of the green arrow,
      thus making it easier to move the field point ever closer to
      the source center and making the field arrow large enough to
      be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In increasing the Length Scale, you will quickly reach a
      setting in which the entire screen is filled with yellow
      color because you can see only a portion of the source object
      near the center of the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of this process, the Data box should show <i>d</i>
      = 0 and <i>g</i> = 0 or something quite close to these
      values.
