      determine the direction of the magnetic field due to a
      current loop, will be able to use the superposition principle
      to calculate the magnetic field due to several current loops,
      and will learn about the magnitude and direction of the

        Field Direction</b> 
        <p>
          The Biot-Savart law specifies both the magnitude and the
          direction of the magnetic field due to current in an
          infinitesimal wire segment. For this applet, we only need
          the part about the direction of the field.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The <b>direction</b> of the magnetic field vector is
          given by the following right-hand rule: point the thumb
          of the right hand in the direction of the current in the
          wire segment, point the outstretched fingers of the right
          hand from the segment axis towards P, and the palm of the
          right hand will be facing in the direction of the
          magnetic field vector. This is illustrated in Figure 1
          below.

          The total magnetic field vector <img src=
          "../MFimages/Bcap.gif" alt="vector B" align="bottom"> at
          a field point P is the vector sum of the infinitesimal

          <u>Comment</u>. In the case of a magnetic field due to
          several current loops, the superposition principle can be
          used first to calculate the field due to a single loop.
          This calculation is difficult and will not be done here.
          The resulting expression for the magnetic field on the
          axis of a circular current loop will simply be stated.
          One can then use the superposition principle once more to
          calculate the field on the axis of more than one coaxial
          current loops.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Reset <img src="../MFimages/Reset.gif"
         alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the Loops button, and select the loop at <i>x</i> = 0.
      Display the Grid to help you select the right loop. When
      done, hide the Grid again. Make sure the radius is set to
      <i>a</i> = 5.0 cm and the current to <i><font face=
      "symbol">I</font></i> = 5.0 A.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the applet to construct a pattern of magnetic field
      lines. Draw the pattern in your Notebook. At a few field
      points chosen to lie on the field lines, draw the magnetic
      field vectors. Set the scale factor to at least 200, or
      whatever value is sufficient to display the field vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. The magnetic field vector <img src=
      "../MFimages/Bcap.gif" alt="vector B" align="bottom"> at a
      field point P due to a current loop is the superposition of
      the infinitesimal field vectors <i>d</i><img src=
      "../MFimages/Bcap.gif" alt="vector B" align="bottom"> due to
      the current in the infinitesimal wire sections around the
      loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the right-hand rule described above to explain the
      directions of the field vectors observed in Exercise 1. Only
      a qualitative explanation is requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, explain the direction of the magnetic field
      vectors on the axis of the loop, on both sides of the loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Suppose a circular current loop has its
      axis (normal to the loop) the <i>x</i>-axis, has its center
      at <i>x</i> = 0, has radius <i>a</i>, and carries current
      <i><font face="symbol">I</font></i>. The magnetic field due
      to this loop is the superposition of the infinitesimal fields
      due to the infinitesimal current segments around the loop. By
      doing the summation (integration), it can be shown that the
      magnitude <i>B</i>(<i>x</i>) of the magnetic field at a point
      on the axis of the loop is equal to
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../MFimages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
         width="100"><i>B</i>(<i>x</i>) = (<font face=

    </p>
    <p>
      Use this equation to calculate the magnitude of the magnetic
      field at the center of the given loop, i.e., at <i>x</i> = 0,
      and at a point outside the loop, at <i>x</i> = <i>a</i>/2.
      Compare your results with the values given in the Data box of
      the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Continuing from Exercises 1 and 2, reverse
      the direction of the current by setting <i><font face=
      "symbol">I</font></i> to -5.0 A. Does the field line pattern
      change when the current direction is reversed? Do the field
      vectors change direction? Explain your observations in terms
      of the right-hand rule.

      Magnetic Field Due To Several Circular Current Loops
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Reset the applet. As in the preceding
      section, keep the radius of the loops at <i>a</i> = 5.0 cm
      and the current at <i><font face="symbol">I</font></i> = 5.0
      A.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the loop at <i>x</i> = 0 and a second loop at <i>x</i>
      = <i>a</i> = 5.0 cm. Since the loops are 1 cm apart, you will
      therefore select Loops 0 and 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      A configuration like this with two coaxial circular loops of
      equal radius <i>a</i> a distance <i>a</i> apart is called a
      <i>Helmholtz coil</i>. Helmholtz coils have the convenient
      property that they produce an approximately uniform magnetic
      field between the two loops. This is an economical way of
      producing a nearly uniform field in the laboratory. Moreover,
      since there is a gap between the two loops, one can easily
      inspect any action taking place in the field between the
      coils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the field point throughout the region between the two
      loops, and record the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components of the
      magnetic field vector at some typical points. Calculate the
      percentage variation in the field components at these field
      points. Make a diagram showing the field points at which you
      are observing the magnetic field vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, use the
      superposition principle and your result from Exercise 3 of
      the preceding section to calculate the magnitude
      <i>B<sub>Helmholtz</sub></i> of the magnetic field vector on
      the axis of the Helmholtz coil midway between the loops.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a good approximation, this should also be the magnitude of
      the field vector at other points between the two loops. (The
      direction of the field at these other points should be quite
      close to that at the midpoint as well, i.e., very nearly
      parallel to the axis.) Check this with the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Verify that for a <b>single</b> current loop,
      with center at <i>x</i> = 0, Equ.(1) for <i>x</i> =
      &plusmn;<i>a</i>/2 reduces to

      <img src="../MFimages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
         width="140"><i>B</i>(&plusmn;<i>a</i>/2) = (<font face=

    <p>
      What will be the magnitude of the magnetic field at <i>x</i>
      = <i>a</i>/2 due to current loop whose center is located at
      <i>x</i> = <i>a</i> if the loop carries the same current
      <i><font face="symbol">I</font></i>? Explain your reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now use the superposition principle to find the magnitude
      <i>B<sub>Helmholtz</sub></i> of the magnetic field at the
      midpoint <i>x</i> = <i>a</i>/2 of the Helmholtz coil defined
      in Exercise 1. Derive the following expression for
      <i>B<sub>Helmholtz</sub></i> in terms of <i><font face=
      "symbol">I</font></i> and <i>a</i>:

         "../MFimages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=

    </p>
    <p>
      Substituting the given values into Expression (3) yields

         width="120"><i>B<sub>Helmholtz</sub></i> =

      This value agrees with that displayed in the Data box of the
      applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Redo the calculation done in Exercise 2
      for a Helmholtz coil with a different radius and a different
      current. Construct the coil with the applet and compare your
      value for the magnitude of the field vector at the midpoint
      of the coil with that given by the applet.

      Keep all 21 loops selected. This way the series of loops

      closer together and there are more of them.) In the

    <p>
      Explore the region in the center of the solenoid that is not
      too close to the ends of the solenoid by dragging the field
      point within this region. Also, let the applet draw some
