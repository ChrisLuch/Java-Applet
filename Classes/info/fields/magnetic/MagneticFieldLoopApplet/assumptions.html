<div class="title">Assumptions - Magnetic Field Due To Current In One
Or Several Circular Loops </div>

    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates the magnetic field due to current in a
    circular wire loop or due to current in several such loops arranged coaxially.  
    </div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">



    <p>The applet makes the following assumptions:

	 <p><ul>

	 <li>All loops carry the same current.</li>

	 <li>The loops are coaxial and circular with the same radius
	 <i>a</i>.</li>

	 <li>The spacing between two neighboring loops is the same for
	 any two such loops.</li>

	 <li>The axis through the centers of the loops lies in the
	 screen and is horizontal.  The loops lie in planes
	 perpendicular to the screen.</li>

	 </ul>

	 <p>As a consequence of the positioning and orientation of the
	 loops, the magnetic field vector at a point in the screen
	 lies in the screen also.</p>
