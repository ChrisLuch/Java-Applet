        <p>
          When the Loops toggle button is selected, you can select
          circular wire loops from a set of 21 coaxial loops.  The
          loops are in a plane perpendicular to the screen and only
          the two points where a loop is intersecting the plane of the
          window are shown.  The common axis of the set of coaxial
          loops is in the plane of the screen.  It is taken to be the
          <i>x</i>-axis.
	</p>
	<p>
          Unselected loops are shown in grey.  To select a loop, click
          on either one of the two points where the loop intersects
          the screen. Selected loops are shown in a copper color.
          In the image above, three loops are selected and the two
          points where the left-most selected loop intersects the
          screen are indicated by black arrows.  
	</p>
	<p>
          The applet displays and calculates the resultant magnetic
          field vector (in blue) due to the current in all selected
          loops, at a field point whose position can be varied. (The
          Vector button needs to be selected for the field vector to
          be displayed.)
	</p>
	<p>
	  Clicking on a selected loop will deselect the loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          All loops carry the same current.  All loops have the same
          radius, and the spacing between any two neighboring loops is
          the same for any two such loops.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Loops button is not selected, the applet
          automatically selects all 21 loops and calculates and
          displays the resultant magnetic field due to the currents in
          all 21 loops.
        </p>
        <p>
          To select several adjoining loops at once, select the
          Loops button, click with the mouse on one loop and
          drag over all loops you want to select.

	Magnetic Field Vector At Variable Field Point <img

	</div>
	<p>
          The physical situation simulated by the applet is
          essentially three-dimensional.  However, at field points in
          the plane of the screen the field vectors also lie in the
          plane of the screen if, as is the case in the applet, the
          current loops are perpendicular to the screen and the axis
          of the loops is in the screen.  See the field point and
          magnetic field vector in the image below. Since the magnetic
          field has rotational symmetry around the common axis of the
          current loops, it is sufficient to show only the magnetic
          field in the plane of the screen.
        </p>
	<p align="center">
          <img src="../MFimages/LoopAxis.gif" alt="Field Vector and Axis">
        </p>
        <p>
          The blue field vector is the resultant magnetic field vector
          due to the currents in all selected loops (three in the
          preceding image).  The vector can be displayed/hidden by
          means of the Vector toggle button.
        </p>
	<p>
	  The field point can be moved anywhere in the window by
	  clicking on it and dragging.  Clicking elsewhere in the
	  window will cause a second field point with field vector to
	  be established at the point clicked, etc.  The image at the
	  very beginning of this Help document shows six field points
	  and field vectors.  Clicking on any existing field point
	  with the mouse will make this the active field point and
	  allow it to be dragged.  The active field point and magnetic
	  field vector at this point are shown in blue, the inactive
	  ones in grey.

        <div class="sectionheading"><li>
           Field Line <img src="../MFimages/FieldLine.gif"
          alt="Field Line" align="top">
        </div>
        <p>
          When this toggle button is selected, the magnetic field line
          through the active field point will be drawn in blue. However,
          since the computations required to draw a field line are
          extensive, it may take several seconds before the field line
          gets drawn completely.  The time required to draw a field
          line depends on the field point and, of course, the speed of
          your computer.  The speed with which the line is drawn can
          be increased, with a corresponding loss of accuracy, or
          decreased, with a corresponding gain of accuracy, by means
          of the Speed/Accuracy slider.  See Point 11 below.
	</p>
	<p>
          Dragging a field point that has a field line drawn through
          it will cause the field line to be dragged along.  However,
          since a new field line has to be computed, it may take
          several seconds before the field line actually follows the
          point.
        </p>
	<p>
          A pattern of several field lines can be drawn by clicking at
          a point, selecting the Field Line button to have the field
          line drawn, then clicking at another point, etc.

           Stop <img src="../MFimages/Stop.gif"
          alt="Stop" align="top">
        </div>
        <p>
          The calculation and drawing of a field line can take a
          number of seconds because of the large number of
          calculations involved.  (See preceding Point 3.) Clicking
          the Stop button will stop these calculations before the
          entire field line is drawn.  The Stop button is active only
          while a field line is being drawn.
	</p>
	<p>
          Also, for certain field points, the calculation of the field
          line may not be accurate enough to create a closed field
          line.  In that case, the program will continue calculating
          and may never stop unless the Stop button is clicked.  If
          the field line does not close, one can click the Stop button
          and set the Speed/Accuracy slider (see Point 11) to a higher
          accuracy and repeat the calculation.  If the accuracy
          setting is high enough, the field line will usually close.

          The Data toggle button lets you display/hide the Data box

          resized by dragging the green rectangle in the lower
          right-hand corner of the box up or down. The box can be
          closed by clicking on the little green box marked by an "X"
          in the upper right-hand corner. The box can be dragged to
          another location in the window by clicking anywhere else in
          the box and dragging.  A green scroll bar inside the box
          allows scrolling through information about individual

          As discussed in Points 3 and 4 above, extensive calculations
          are required in drawing a field line.  The calculations
          involve a numerical approximation whose accuracy can be
          improved by using more steps of smaller step size, with a
          corresponding increase in time required (and decrease in
          speed) to complete the calculations.  The Speed/Accuracy
          slider allows you to adjust the point of this trade-off.
          The range of the slider is from 5/1 for maximum
          speed/minimum accuracy to 1/5 for minimum speed/maximum
          accuracy.
