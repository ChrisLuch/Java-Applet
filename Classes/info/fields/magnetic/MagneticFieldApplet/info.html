          When the Segments toggle button is selected and you are in
          the "Physical Reality View" mode, you can select wire
          segments by clicking on parts of the wire that are shown in
          grey (unselected segments). Selected segments are shown in a
          copper color.  In the image above, four segments are
          selected.  The applet displays and calculates the resultant
          magnetic field vector (in blue) at field point P due to the
          current in all selected segments.  (The Vector button needs
          to be selected for the field vector to be displayed.)
	</p>
	<p>
	  Clicking on a selected segment will deselect the segment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In calculating the magnetic field due to the current in a
          segment, the applet takes the position of the segment to be
          that of the center of the segment.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Segments button is not selected, the applet assumes
          the wire to be infinitely extended and it displays and
          calculates the magnetic field vector for a current in such a
          wire. The wire is shown entirely in copper color when the
          Segments button is not selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wire is shown entirely in copper color also when the
          Segments button <b>is</b> selected and all segments of the
          wire in the applet window are selected. However, the field
          vector in this case will be the field vector due to the
          current in the selected segments only, not that due to the
          current in an infinitely extended wire.
        </p>
        <p>
          To select several adjoining segments at once, select the
          Segments button, click with the mouse on one segment and
          drag along all segments you want to select.
        </p>

	<p>
          The physical situation simulated by the applet is
          essentially three-dimensional.  To display all three
          dimensions, the applet displays a side view of the wire
          (projection onto the <i>y</i>,<i>z</i> plane) in the left
          portion of the window and a front view of the wire
          (projection onto the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> plane) in the right
          portion of the window.  The coordinate axes and the
          coordinates of the variable field point P can be inspected
          in the "Coordinate View" mode as illustrated in the diagram
          below.  See Point 7, "Mode", below.
        </p>
	<p align="center">
          <img src="../MFimages/MFCoordinateView.gif" alt="Coordinate View">
        </p>
        <p>
          In the "Physical Reality View" mode, when the Vector toggle
          button and the Segments toggle button are selected, the
          resultant magnetic field vector at the given field point due
          to the current in all selected segments will be displayed in
          blue as in the following picture.  The left and right
          portions of the window will show the projections of the
          field vector onto the <i>y</i>,<i>z</i> and
          <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> planes, respectively.  The projections of
          the magnetic field "line" through point P onto the two
          planes are shown as well.  (Blue circle on the right, blue
          straight line on the left.)
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <img src="../MFimages/MFRealityView.gif" alt="Reality View">
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Segments button is not selected, selecting the
          Vector button will display the magnetic field at point P
          due to a current in an infinitely long straight wire.
        </p>
	<p>
          The applet allows the field point P to be anywhere in the
          three-dimensional <i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i> space.  The
          left portion of the window shows the projection of P onto the
          <i>y</i>,<i>z</i> plane, the right portion of the window the
          projection of P onto the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> plane.  In the
          left portion of the window, point P can be dragged only
          horizontally, i.e., parallel to the wire and to the
          <i>z</i>-axis.  In the right portion of the window, P can be
          dragged freely.  In general, dragging the projection of the
          point in the right portion of the window will affect the
          projection of the point in the left portion.

          When this toggle button is selected, the projections onto
          the two planes of the magnetic field line (circle) through
          the field point will be shown in blue, as a circle in the
          right portion of the applet window and as a straight line in
          the left portion of the window.  All field "lines" are
          circles parallel to the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> plane. The
          projection of such a circle onto the
          <i>y</i>,<i>z</i> plane is a straight line parallel to the
          <i>y</i> axis.  See the last image in the preceding Point 3.

          The current direction is indicated by small arrows on the

          The magnitude of the current is represented by the density

          The Current Slider allows you to vary the current between

          current is relative to the direction of the <i>z</i>-axis
          and relative to which kind of current direction is used.
          (See the preceding Point 8.)  If the current is positive,
          the conventional current is in the positive
          <i>z</i>-direction, and the electron current in the negative
          <i>z</i>-direction.  If the current is negative, the
          conventional current is in the negative <i>z</i>-direction,
          and the electron current in the positive <i>z</i>-direction.
