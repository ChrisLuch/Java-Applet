        <p>
          Oersted discovered in 1820 that a magnetic compass needle
          was deflected near a current-carrying wire. Very soon
          after this discovery, Amp&egrave;re and the team of Biot
          and Savart performed experiments on the effects of
          currents on magnets and gave quantitative descriptions of
          the forces produced. The law that describes the magnetic
          field accompanying electric currents is now called the
          <i>Biot-Savart Law</i>. In the form given below, the law
          can be used to calculate the magnetic field due to any
          distribution of currents.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Imagine an infinitesimal segment of a wire carrying a
          current <i><font face="symbol">I</font></i>.  The segment
          has length <i>ds</i>. Figure 1 below illustrates the segment
          in orange, a field point P, and in blue the infinitesimal
          magnetic field vector at P due to the current in the given
          segment. The field point P and the field vector are shown in
          two projections: the Side View shows the projection onto the
          <i>y</i>,<i>z</i> plane and the Front View the projection
          onto the
          <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> plane. The coordinate axes are defined
          under Help.

          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at the wire from the side, the field point P is
            in front of the screen and the field vector is pointing
            downwards and towards the viewer. The field vector is
            along the tangent to the circle through P that is
            concentric with the axis along which the given wire
            segment is aligned.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <b>direction</b> of the field vector is given by
            the following right-hand rule: point the thumb of the
            right hand in the direction of the current, point the
            outstretched fingers of the right hand from the segment
            axis towards P, and the palm of the right hand will be
            facing in the direction of the magnetic field vector.
            This is illustrated in Figure 2 below.

            The angle <font face="symbol">a</font> and the distance
            <i>d</i> are illustrated by the applet when you select
            the Coordinate View mode and click on the relevant wire
            segment. See also Point 3 under Help. Keep in mind that
            the angle labeled <font face="symbol">a</font> in the
            applet is the projection of the real angle onto the
            <i>y</i>,<i>z</i> plane and therefore does not have the
            correct size of the real angle <font face=
            "symbol">a</font>, unless point P is in the
            <i>y</i>,<i>z</i> plane.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Comment</u>. The Biot-Savart expression above for
            the magnitude of the magnetic field is correct for
            infinitesimal <i>ds</i> and <i>dB</i>, i.e., for a
            segment length and magnetic field vector in the limit
            where these quantities go to zero. The applet cannot
            simulate true infinitesimals. In the applet, the
            segment length <i>ds</i> is taken to be 0.20 m, and the
            displacement <img src="../MFimages/d.gif" alt=
            "vector d" align="bottom"> is taken from the center of
            this segment.

          <u>Comment</u>. A sum of infinitesimals is called an
          integral. Since the applet is not simulating true
          infinitesimals, but small and finite current segments and
          the corresponding finite field vectors, we will be doing
          ordinary sums rather than integrals.

      Select the Segments button, and click on the wire in the

      Use the Biot-Savart law (1) to calculate the magnitude
      <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> of the magnetic field at point P due to

      <b>Answer</b>. Let us first calculate the distance

    </p>
    <p>

      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>) = (-0.30,0.30,0.40) m,

    <p>
      To calculate <i>sin</i> <font face=

      distance <i>r</i> of P from the <i>z</i>-axis on which the
      current segment is located. (Go into Coordinate View mode to
      see the coordinate <i>r</i> defined.) Thus,

      compare? Consider the locations of the two segments relative

      Magnetic Field Due To Current In A Straight Wire
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Reset the applet. As in the preceding
      sections, set the field point P at
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>) = (-0.30, 0.30, 0.40) m. Select
      the Segments button and select all segments available in the
      window. Record the magnitude of the total magnetic field due
      to all selected segments as shown in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then deselect the Segments button. This selects the entire
      infinite straight wire. Record the magnitude of the total
      magnetic field at P due to the current in the infinite wire.
      This magnitude should be just slightly larger than that when
      only the segments are selected that fit into the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. For an infinitely long straight
      current-carrying wire, an exact integration (summation of the
      infinitesimal contributions <i>dB</i> given by Equ.(1)) gives
      the following simple result for the magnitude <i>B</i> of the
      total magnetic field at point P:

          width="100"><i>B</i> = (<font face=
          "symbol">m</font><sub>0</sub>/4<font face=
          "symbol">p</font>) &times;2<i><font face="symbol">I</font></i> /
          <i>r</i>, <img src="../MFimages/small.gif" alt="space"
          height="1" width="20"><font face=
          "symbol">m</font><sub>0</sub>/4<font face=

          A<sup>-1</sup>.<img src="../MFimages/small.gif" alt=
          "space" height="1" width="40">(8)
    </p>
     
    <p>
      Use this equation to calculate <i>B</i> for the present case.
      The result should agree with that shown in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compare the denominators in Eqs.(1) and (8). There are two
      differences. What are they?
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment</u>. The denominator in Equ.(8) has the distance
      <i>r</i> of the field point P from the wire to the
      <b>first</b> power. This is the result of the integration
      over the infinite wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, double and
      triple the distance <i>r</i> of point P from the wire. Record
      the corresponding values of the total magnitude <i>B</i> of
      the field. Are the values consistent with the
      <i>r</i>-dependence of the magnitude as given in Equ.(8)?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Continuing from Exercise 3, move the field
      point P parallel to the wire without changing the distance
      <i>r</i> of the field point from the wire. Do this twice: (a)
      when the Segments button is deselected so that the field
      shown by the applet is that due to the infinite wire and (b)
      when the Segments button and all wire segments in the window
      are selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the dependence of the total field on the position of
      point P in the two cases. Describe what differences you observe,
      and explain your observation in terms of the Biot-Savart law and
      the principle of superposition.
