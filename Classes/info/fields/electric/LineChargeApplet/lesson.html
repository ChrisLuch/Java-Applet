          Any two particles carrying electric charges
          <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> exert
          electrostatic forces on each other. If the two charges
          have the same sign, the particles exert repulsive forces
          on each other. If they have opposite sign, the forces are
          attractive. The force exerted on Particle 1 has the same
          magnitude <i>F</i> as the force exerted on Particle 2,

            <u>Comment on Equ.(3)</u>. Equ.(3) implies that the
            force exerted by Particle 1 on Particle 2 is in the
            direction of the displacement <img src="d.gif" alt=
            "vector d" align="bottom"> from Particle 1 to Particle
            2 if both <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>
            have the same sign, i.e., if their product is positive.
            That means the force is repulsive in this case, which
            is correct. If one of the charges is negative, the
            force reverses sign and is attractive, which is correct
            also.
          </p>
          <p>
            The magnitude of the force <img src="F.gif" alt=
            "vector F" align="bottom"><sub>12</sub> is equal to
            Expression (1) because the magnitude of the vector
            <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align="bottom"> in the
            numerator of Equ.(3) is equal to <i>d</i> which can be
            canceled against the <i>d</i><sup>3</sup> in the
            denominator to give an overall
            1/<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>-dependence of the magnitude of
            the force as in Equ.(1).

        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 1</u>. Since the force <img src="F.gif"
             alt="vector F" align="bottom"> is proportional to the
             charge <i>q</i>, the electric field <img src="E.gif"
             alt="vector E" align="bottom"> is independent of
             <i>q</i> and characterizes an "electric intensity" at
             the given point in space that is present without the
             test particle and does not depend on any properties of
             the test particle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 2</u>. The SI-unit of the electric field is N/C.
          One can show that 1 N/C = 1 V/m where "V" stands for "volt",
          the SI-unit of electric potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 3</u>. The electric field is defined at all
          points in space. It is therefore not a single vector, but
          a "vector-valued function defined on space". This simply
          means that to describe the electric field one must
          specify the vectors <img src="E.gif" alt="vector E"
             align="bottom"> at all points in space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Comment 4</u>. An <i>electric field line</i> is a line
          (not a straight line in general) that indicates the
          direction of the electric field vectors at points along
          the line.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The electric field vector at a given point along an
          <i>electric field line</i> is tangential to the line at
          that point.

    <b>Preliminary Remark</b>. The applet displays everything in only
    two dimensions.  These are represented by an <i>x</i> and a
    <i>y</i> axis.  The charge-carrying wire is laid out along the
    <i>x</i>-axis and the field points at which the electric field
    vectors are simulated lie in the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> plane, as do
    the field vectors themselves.  Therefore the <i>z</i>-coordinate
    of a field point and the <i>z</i>-component of any electric field
    vector are zero always and are simply omitted, for brevity's sake.
  </p>
  <p>
    Restricting everything to the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> plane involves no
    loss in generality because of the rotational symmetry of the
    electric field around the wire.
  </p>
    <p>
      <b>Task 1</b>. Under "Laws and Definitions" above, read the
      sections on
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Coulomb's Law of Electrostatics",
      </li>
      <li>
        "Definition of Electric Field and Electric Field Lines".
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Derive an expression for the electric
      field vector <img src="E.gif" alt="vector E" align="bottom">
      and the magnitude <i>E</i> of this vector at a field point P
      due to a point charge <i>Q</i>. Assume that the displacement
      vector from the point charge to the field point is
         <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align="bottom">. The
         distance <i>d</i> between these two points is equal to the
         magnitude of the vector <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d"
         align="bottom">.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the direction of the electric field vector at P for
      different signs of the source charge <i>Q</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Expression (3) for the Coulomb force needs to be
      combined with Definition (5) of the electric field vector.  Let
      Particle 1 carry the source charge and let Particle 2 be the
      test particle. Thus, <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>Q</i> and
      <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> = <i>q</i> and the force <img src= "F.gif"
      alt="vector F" align="bottom"> exerted by the source charge on
      the test particle is equal to

    </p>
    <p>
      Substituting this expression for <img src="F.gif" alt=

      electric field vector at point P

    </p>
    <p>
      Taking magnitudes of both sides of Equ.(7) and canceling a
      factor of <i>d</i> on the right-hand side gives for the
      magnitude of the electric field at P

      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=

    </p>
    <p>
      The direction of the electric field vector <img src="E.gif"
      alt="vector E" align="bottom"> is the same as that of
      <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align="bottom"> if <i>Q</i>
      is positive, i.e., away from the source charge. For negative
      <i>Q</i> the direction is the opposite, i.e., towards the
      source charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. The applet lets you select short segments
      of a uniformly charged straight wire. The applet treats each
      such segment as a point charge located at the center of the
      segment and evaluates the electric field due to the segment
      according to Equ.(7).
    </p>
    <p>
      The length <i>s</i> of each segment is 0.20 m. Suppose the
      linear charge density <font face="symbol">l</font> along the
      wire, i.e., the charge per unit length, is 5.00 C/m. What is
      the charge <i>Q</i> on one wire segment?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The linear charge density <font face=
      "symbol">l</font> is defined as
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "200"><font face="symbol">l</font> = <i>Q</i> / <i>s</i>
      .<img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40">(9)
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore,
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "140"><i>Q</i> = <font face="symbol">l</font> <i>s</i> =
      5.00&times;0.20 = 1.00 C.<img src="small.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40">(10)
    </p>
    <p>
      There is 1.00 C of charge on each 0.20-m wire segment.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Reset <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset"
      align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the Segments button, and select Segment 0, which is the
      segment immediately to the right of the origin. Its center is at
      <i>x</i> = 0.10 m. Use the Grid to help you do this, and verify
      from the Data box that Segment 0 is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure the line charge density <font face=
      "symbol">l</font> is set to 5.00 C/m.

    <p>
      Take the field point P to be at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (1.00,

      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, select Segment
      7 at <i>x</i> = 1.50 m. Calculate the electric field
         <img src="E.gif" alt="vector E" align=
         "bottom"><sub>7</sub> due to this segment at the same
         field point P as in Exercise 2. Check your answer in the
         Data box.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Continuing from Exercise 3, make a sketch
      in your Notebook showing the wire with Segments 0 and 7, the
      field point P, and the contributions to the total field
      vector at P due to the two segments. Then use the applet to
      check your sketch. Make sure the Resultant button is
      deselected, but the Vector button is selected.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Continuing from Exercise 4, reverse the
      sign of the line charge density by setting <font face=
      "symbol">l</font> to -5.00 C/m. Draw the new electric field
      vectors due to Segments 0 and 7 in your Notebook. Explain any
      differences compared to the case of positive charge density.

      Electric Field Due To Several Line Charge Segments
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Reset the applet. As in Exercise 2 of the
      preceding section, set the field point P at
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (1.00, 0.50) m. Select Segments 0 and 7
      at <i>x</i> = 0.10 m and <i>x</i> = 1.50 m, respectively.
      Make sure the line charge density is set to <font face=
      "symbol">l</font> = 5.00 C/m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the superposition principle and the results of the
      preceding section to calculate the electric field vector
      <img src="E.gif" alt="vector E" align="bottom"> at P due to
      the two charge segments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hint</b>. The Data box displays the partial electric
      field vectors <img src="E.gif" alt="vector E" align=
      "bottom"><sub>0</sub> and <img src="E.gif" alt="vector E"
      align="bottom"><sub>7</sub> due to Segments 0 and 7. Add the
      <i>x</i>-components of the two vectors and the
      <i>y</i>-components to obtain the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
      components of the resultant field vector. The components of
      the resultant vector are also shown in the Data box. To display
      the vector graphically (in green), select the Resultant
      button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do the required addition in your Notebook.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, add two more
      segments in addition to Segment 0 and 7. Choose one of the new
      segments as far to the right of P as Segment 0 is to the left
      and the other one as far to the left of P as Segment 7 is to the
      right. What are the label numbers of the new segments?
    </p>
    <p>
      Deselect the Resultant button and select the Vectors button
      again, to display the four electric field vectors at P that
      are due to the four selected segments. The paired segments
      should produce field vectors that are mirror images of each
      other about a vertical line through P. In your Notebook,
      sketch the four segments and point P with the four
      corresponding field vectors. Tentatively, draw in the
      resultant of the four vectors as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculate the resultant vector of the four partial vectors,
      i.e., calculate the total electric field vector at P due to
      the four chosen charge segments. Use the symmetry of the
      arrangement to simplify the calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compare your result with that shown in the Data box. Select
      the Resultant button to display the total electric field
      vector at P in green. Does its direction agree with what you
      expected? Discuss why the direction should be as shown in the
      applet, paying attention to the symmetry of the arrangement.

      Electric Field Due To An Infinite Line Charge
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Reset the applet. As in the preceding
      sections, set the field point P at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) =
      (1.00, 0.50) m. Select the Segments button, and select all
      segments available in the window. Record the total electric
      field vector due to all selected segments as shown in the
      Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then deselect the Segments button. This selects the entire
      infinite straight wire. Record the total electric field vector
      at P due to the charge on the infinite wire. In terms of the
      superposition principle combined with relevant aspects of
      Equ.(7), explain the differences in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
      components of the two total field vectors that you have
      recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. For an infinitely long straight
      current-carrying wire, an exact integration (summation of the
      infinitesimal electric field vectors due to the infinitesimal
      line charge segments) gives the following simple expression for
      the total electric field vector at a field point a distance
      <i>y</i> from the wire:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "200"><img src="E.gif" alt="vector E" align="bottom"> =
      <i>k</i> (0, 2<font face=
         "symbol">l</font> / <i>y</i>).<img src="small.gif" alt=
         "space" height="1" width="40">(14)
    </p>
    <p>
      Use this equation to calculate <img src="E.gif" alt=
      "vector E" align="bottom"> in the present case. The result
      should agree with that shown in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compare the denominators in Eqs.(8) and (14). There are two
      differences. What are they?  Check that the right-hand side of
      Equ.(14) has the dimensions of an electric field, i.e., N/C.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment</u>. The denominator in Equ.(14) has the distance
      <i>y</i> of the field point P from the wire to the
      <b>first</b> power. This is the result of the integration
      over the infinite wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, double and
      triple the distance <i>y</i> of point P from the wire. Record
      the corresponding values of the <i>y</i>-component of the
      field vector, which is the only non-zero component. Are the
      values consistent with the <i>y</i>-dependence as given in
      Equ.(14)?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Continuing from Exercise 3, move the field
      point P parallel to the wire without changing the distance
      <i>y</i> of the field point from the wire. Do this twice: (a)
      when the Segments button is deselected so that the field vector
      shown is that due to the infinite wire and (b) when the Segments
      button and all wire segments in the window are selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case (a), when looking at the field due to the infinite wire,
      display the resultant vector while moving point P.  Adjust the
      scale factor so that the entire vector fits into the window. In
      case (b), when looking at the field due to the portion of the
      wire that fits into the window, hide the resultant vector and
      display the vectors due to the individual segments while moving
      point P. Again, choose a suitable scale factor. Repeat this with
      the resultant vector displayed, but reduce the scale factor
      again so that all of the resultant is visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the dependence of the total field on the position of
      point P in the two cases. Describe what differences you
      observe, and explain your observations in terms of Equ.(7)
      and the principle of superposition.
