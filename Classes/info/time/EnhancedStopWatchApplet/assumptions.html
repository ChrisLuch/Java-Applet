      Help - Timer Stopwatch
    </div>
    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates a stopwatch than can be run forward and
      backward and thus act as a timer.

	 <p>
      There are no assumptions other than that the computer clock is
      running accurately to one hundredth of a second.
    </p>
	 <p>
      Although the applet responds to a mouse click within a time
      interval that is shorter than one hundredth of a second, there
      is a delay in the response of the stopwatch applet related to
      the time it takes for the mouse button to be pressed.  Only when
      the button is fully pressed will the clock start or stop
      running.
