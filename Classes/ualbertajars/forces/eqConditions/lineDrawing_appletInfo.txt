When you click the top-right button in the applet, you toggle on and off the "line draw" mode.  This mode removes all the images and replaces them with a simple line drawing with the person represented by a black circle.  This mode is intended to help you evaluate the free body diagram without the extra clutter of the graphics.  All the functionality of the applet still exists in this mode.
