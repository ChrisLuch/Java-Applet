Adjust the masses of the ladder and the person by manipulating the appropriate slider.  You can also adjust the coefficient of friction between the ladder and the ground.  Then experiment with different ladder angles by pressing the mouse button with the pointer on the ladder tip and drag it up and down the wall.  When the force of friction is no longer great enough the ladder will fall down.  You can change the position of the person on the ladder by dragging him along the ladder.  Data is displayed both on the applet display itself and in the info window which is accessible by clicking on the top-middle button.
