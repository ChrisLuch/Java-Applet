      The circular path of the mass point will be displayed in

      at the point marked "0, 2<font face="symbol">p</font>". Click
      on the mass point, and drag it along the circle to set the
      starting position of the motion.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset"
      align="top"> the applet, and make sure the Continuous mode is
      selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the Vectors button to display the Vector Panel, select
      "position" and "velocity at particle" to display the mass
      point's position vector (in cyan) and the mass point's
      velocity vector (in magenta) attached to the mass point. Then
      close the Vector Panel. Set the Zoom slider to setting 12,
      which will slightly increase the length of the arrow
      representing the velocity but will leave the position vector
      and the blue particle path unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play the motion. Observe the direction of the velocity vector
      in relation to that of the position vector and in relation to
      the blue circular path.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. For any motion of a mass point, the velocity
      vector always points in the direction of motion of the tip of
      the position vector. At a given instant, this direction is
      that of the tangent to the path of the mass point. For a
      circular path as in this applet, the tangential direction to
      the path, and therefore the direction of the velocity vector,
      is at all times at right angles to the position vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is true even if the speed is not constant. To check
      this, Rewind the applet, set the <i>dv</i>/<i>dt</i>-slider
      to 0.10 m/s<sup>2</sup>, and Play the motion. You should be
      able to observe that while the arrow representing the
      velocity vector is getting longer it always remains
      perpendicular to the position vector and tangential to the
      mass point's circular path.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, click Rewind,
      set the <i>dv</i>/<i>dt</i>-slider back to 0, and in the
      Vector Panel check "velocity at origin" in addition to the
      other two vectors already checked in Exercise 1. This will
      display a second copy of the velocity vector, this one with
      its tail end at the origin. Hide the Vector Panel, and take
      the Zoom slider to setting 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play the motion, and describe what you observe. Make a
      drawing showing the three vectors and the mass point's path
      at two different instants of time.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, hide the
      velocity vector that is attached to the mass point (by
      deselecting "velocity at particle" in the Vector Panel) so
      that only the position vector and the velocity vector that is
      attached to the origin remain displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click Rewind, and select the Velocity Trace button
         <img src="VTrace.gif" alt="Velocity Trace" align="top">.
         The trace of the tip of the velocity vector from the
         previous motion will be displayed.

    <p>
      Play the motion again. The trace made by the tip of the
      velocity vector will be redrawn and extended as the motion
      continues. Make a drawing of the two vectors and their two

      <b>Answer</b>. The position-velocity configuration at the
      instant of the velocity-acceleration configuration of Figure
      5 is shown in Figure 6 below.

    <p>
      Observe that the relationship between acceleration and
      velocity shown in Figure 6 is analogous to that between
      velocity and position in Figure 5. The acceleration-velocity
      pair is rotated by 90<sup>o</sup> relative to the
      velocity-position pair.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, delete the
      velocity-at-particle vector and add the the
      velocity-at-origin and acceleration-at-origin vectors.
      Display both the Position Trace and the Velocity Trace. Make
      a drawing of the configuration. Then Play the motion and
      observe how the configuration of the three vectors changes
      during the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figure 7 below shows the configuration of
      position-velocity-acceleration vectors, all three attached to
      the origin, at the moment illustrated in Figures 5 and 6.

    <p>
      The velocity vector is 90<sup>o</sup> ahead of the position
      vector and the acceleration vector, in turn, is
      90<sup>O</sup> ahead of the velocity vector. This
      configuration is maintained throughout the motion.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset"
      align="top"> the applet, and make sure it is set to the
      Continuous Mode by selecting the appropriate radio button
      <img src="CMMode.gif" alt="Mode" align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the net force acting on the mass point by selecting
      "force" in the Vector Panel. The arrow representing the force
      vector (in dark blue) will point from the mass point to the
      center of the mass point's circular orbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play the motion, and observe the force vector during the
      motion. It should remain pointing towards the center of the
      circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, click Rewind,
      and vary the mass setting. The length of the blue arrow
      representing the net force should vary in proportion to the
      mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, click Rewind,
      and vary the Zoom setting. The length of the arrow
      representing the net force should vary with the square of the
      Zoom setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Continuing from Exercise 3, click Rewind,
      and set the <i>dv</i>/<i>dt</i>-slider to 0.10
      m/s<sup>2</sup>. The arrow representing the force vector
      should now have both a tangential component pointing forward
      and a radial component pointing towards the center of the
      circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the radial and tangential components (in light blue)
      of the net force by selecting "force components" in the
      Vector Panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play the motion and observe how the force components change
      during the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The tangential component of the net force
      should stay the same in magnitude. Its magnitude is equal to
      <i>m</i>|<i>dv</i>/<i>dt</i>|. The radial component should be
      increasing in magnitude with the square of the speed of the
      mass point. The magnitude of the radial component of the net
      force is equal to <i>mv</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>r</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Display the "acceleration-at-particle"
      vector. It will be covered by the net force vector, but the
      arrow tip should be visible underneath the force vector. Play
      the motion. You should be able to observe that the
      acceleration and net force are pointing in the same direction
      and are proportional to each other.

      This section will take you through a demonstration indicating
      that the laws of circular motion were known in China already
      many centuries ago.

    <p>
      Hide the Position Trace by deselecting the Trace-P button and
      select the Trace-V button instead to display the Velocity
      Trace. Set the Zoom slider to 12. At this point only the
      black dot representing the mass point should be displayed in
      the applet window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play the motion until the mass point has completed one
      revolution and a complete circular velocity trace is drawn.
      Then Pause the motion, and click Rewind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set the angular acceleration slider to the value
         <font face="symbol">a</font> = -0.33 rad/s<sup>2</sup>,
         and Play the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mass point will start moving counter-clockwise, but its
      motion will be slowing down, come to a stop, reverse
      direction, and speed up again. When the mass point has
      reached its starting position, Pause the motion. The traces
      on the screen should form the pattern shown in Figure 10
      below.
