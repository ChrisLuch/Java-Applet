      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src="../images/Reset.gif"
         align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click somewhere in the applet window. A green dot should
      appear at the point where you clicked. This is a <i>field
      point</i>.  A green arrow attached to the field point may be visible as well.
		See Figure 1 in Exercise 4 below for an illustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not a green arrow is visible depends on the magnitude of the electric
		field at the given field point.  If the magnitude is too small, the arrow is
		correspondingly small and invisible.  The magnitude of the field vector at a given point
      depends on how close the field point is to either one of
      the two source charges (red or blue ball).
    </p>
     <p>
      Drag either one of the source charges towards or away from
      the field point and observe the changes in the field vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. RESET the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click somewhere in the applet window, but this time drag the
      field point around the window before releasing the mouse
      button. You should be able to observe how the field vector
      varies in magnitude and direction depending on the location
      of the field point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the applet is designed so that a field point cannot
      be moved inside one of the source objects.  Neither can the source
      object be dragged over a field point. Try it! 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. RESET the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click in the applet window and drag the field point to a
      position where the arrow representing the field vector just
      disappears. The Vector Length Scale slider should still
      be at its minimal default setting. Move the slider tab to the right.
		The field vector arrow should become visible and be
      increasing in length as the slider setting goes to a larger scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. RESET the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the two source objects reasonably close together, and
      select a field point not too far from and somewhat in between
      the sources, as in Figure 1 below. Use the charge sliders to
      set <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> = 25 C and <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> = -25 C.
      If necessary, increase the setting of the Vector Length
      Scale slider to get an arrow of good length.

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Without changing the field point, vary <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>
      and then <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub>, through their entire ranges
      from -50 to 50. Observe how the field vector direction
      rotates when the charge values are varied.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Repeat Exercise 4, but this time select
      the Components button <img src="../images/Components.gif"
      align="top"> so that the individual field vectors due to the
      two source charges are shown in addition to the total field
      vector, which is shown in green. Figure 2 below shows an
      example of what you might see.
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe how only one of the individual vectors changes as the
      value of one of the source charges is changed. Observe that
      the color of the individual vectors matches the color of its
      source.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 6</b>. Without resetting the applet, click a few
      more times in the applet window so that you get a few more
      field points and field vectors. All field points and field
      vectors will be shown in grey, except for the last field
      point and vector in green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vary the settings of both Charge sliders throughout their
      ranges. Observe the changes in the field vectors. Do the same
      with the Vector Length Multiplier slider settings.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Move the source objects reasonably close
      together, as in Figure 3 below, and click in the applet
      window to set a field point somewhere in between the two
      sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the Field-Line button <img src=
      "../images/FieldLine.gif" align="top"> to draw a green field
      line through the field point, and click the
      Equipotential-Line button <img src=
      "../images/EquipotentialLine.gif" align="top"> to draw a red
      equipotential line through the field point. The equipotential
      "lines" are actually loops surrounding one of the source
      charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag the field point to another positon, and again draw the
      field line and equipotential line through this point. Repeat
      this for one or more points. Depending on where the field
      point is located when the field lines and equipotential lines
      are drawn, you might get something like the image in Figure 3
      below.

      <b>Figure 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Without resetting the applet, drag the
      green field point in two ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        along a field line,
      </li>
      <li>
        along an equipotential line.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Observe the direction of the field vector. It should always
      be along an electric field line and always be perpendicular
      to an electric potential line. You may need to increase the
      Vector Length Scale slider setting to get a large enough
      vector arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Repeat Exercises 1 and 2 when both source
      charges are positive, say, both equal to +25.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the electric field lines should "repel" each other
      and not go from one source object to the other. Depending on the field point chosen,
		the equipotential line through that point will either loop around only one of the two
      source charges or around both of them.

    <p>
      Select the Field-Grid-Point button <img src=
      "../images/Grid.gif" align="top">, and drag the two sources
      so that they are both roughly centered between four
      neighboring grid points. You should see something like the
      image in Figure 4 below. Adjust the setting of the Vector
      Length Scale slider if necessary.

      <b>Figure 4</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The grid is an array of grey field points. There are no
      charges located at these points. The purpose of the grid is
      to make it easy to observe the electric field due to the
      source charges at a large number of field points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Repeat some of the earlier exercises with
      the grid displayed. Here are some suggestions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click on one of the grid points and draw an electric field
        line and equipotential line through this point. Repeat this
        for several more grid points to build up a pattern of field
        lines and equipotential lines.
      </li>
      <li>
        Move either one of the sources through the grid and observe
        how the field vectors at the grid points respond.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vary the settings of the Charge sliders.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that the applet is designed so that a source
      object cannot be dragged over a grid point or other field point selected by you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continue with the state of the applet as
      in Exercise 2, and don't click Reset. Instead, click REWIND
      <img src="../images/Rewind.gif" align="top">. This should
      remove the grid, any extra field points, and any field and
      equipotential lines. It should not change the slider settings
      and the positions of the source charges.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src="../images/Reset.gif"
         align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click in the area between the two source charges to set a
      field point with field vector, and set the Vector Length
      Scale slider to a setting where you get a well sized
      arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set the <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> slider to, say,
      <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> = 50 and leave the <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub>
      slider at <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> = -25. Then check the
      Simulate-Dipole-System checkbox <img src=
      "../images/DFDipoleCheck.gif" align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both <i>Q</i> values will be reset so that they have the same
      magnitude and opposite sign. The field vector will be
      adjusted accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now change the charge on one of the Charge sliders, say,
      <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>. You should see two things happening:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Source 2 is moving towards or away from Source 1 depending
        on whether |<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>| increases or decreases.
      </li>
      <li>
        The setting of the <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> slider is adjusted
        automatically so that <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> =
        -<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These changes are such that the magnitude
      |<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>|<i>a</i> of the dipole moment of the
      two source charges remains constant where <i>a</i> is the
      distance between the charges from center to center.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Make no changes in the applet's settings.
      In particular, keep the Simulate-Dipole-System checkbox
      checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move either one of the source charges. Observe that the two
      charge sliders have their settings adjusted automatically so
      that <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> = -<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub> at all
      times and so that |<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>|<i>a</i> remains
      constant.
