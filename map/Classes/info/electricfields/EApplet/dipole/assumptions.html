<div class="title">Assumptions - Electric Field Due To Two Point Charges</div>

<p><div class="sectionheading">The applet simulates the electric field
 and the equipotential lines (Curves) accompanying two electric point
 charges. </div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">



    <p>The applet makes the following assumptions:

	 <p><ul>

	 <li>The two source objects, i.e., the objects responsible for the
	 existence of the electric field, are perfect spheres of non-zero
	 radius..</li>

	 <li>The charge densities of the source objects are uniform throughout
	 the object.</li>

	 </ul>

	 <p>A consequence of these assumptions is that, for points outside
	 the source objects, the source objects behave like point charges.

	 <p>The applet does not permit field points inside the finite
	 source objects.  Its purpose is to simulate the electric field due
	 to a pair of point charges.
