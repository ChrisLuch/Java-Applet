      <b>Instructions</b>

    <p>
      This page is designed to get you started using the applet.
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on
      this page are to be done in the applet. You may need to
      toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if your
      screen space is limited.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src="../images/Reset.gif"
         alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click somewhere in the applet window. A green dot should
      appear at the point where you clicked. This is a <i>field
      point</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on how close the field point is to the source
      charge (red ball), an arrow representing the electric field
      vector at the field point will or will not be shown. There
      will be no arrow if the distance between the field point and
      the source is so large that the field vector is too small to
      be noticeable at this scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. RESET the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click somewhere in the applet window, but this time drag the
      field point around the window before releasing the mouse
      button. You should be able to observe how the field vector
      varies in magnitude and direction depending on the location
      of the field point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Release the mouse button, and now drag the source. You should
      again be able to observe changes in magnitude and direction
      of the field vector at the field point which is now fixed.
      Note that the applet is designed so that the source object
      cannot be dragged over a field point. Try it! The reason for
      this design is given under "2. Field Point Grid" in the Help
      document on the menu above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the field vector is determined by the
      <b>relative</b> configuration of field point and source. If
      the field point and source are both shifted by the same
      amount in the same direction, so that their relative
      configuration remains unchanged, the field vector remains
      unchanged as well. Verify this!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. RESET the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click in the applet window and drag the field point to a
      position where the arrow representing the field vector just
      disappears. The Vector Length Multiplier slider should still
      be at the default setting 1. Move the slider tab to a higher
      setting. The field vector arrow should become visible and be
      increasing in length as the slider setting goes to a higher
      value.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Without resetting the applet, move the
      Source Charge slider tab to a different setting from the
      default setting <i>Q</i> = 25 C. The Charge slider changes
      the source charge <i>Q</i>. Make sure you include <i>Q</i> =
      0 and negative <i>Q</i> in your settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnitude of the arrow representing the field vector
      should be proportional to the magnitude of the source charge.
      The direction of the field vector should be away from the
      source for positive charge and towards the source for
      negative charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Without resetting the applet, click again
      in the applet window so that you get a second field point and
      field vector. The first field point and field vector will now
      be shown in grey and the new point and vector in green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add a few more field points and vectors, and vary both the
      Charge slider and Vector Length Scale slider settings.
      Observe the changes in the field vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the source, and observe how the magnitudes of the field
      vectors increase at the points that the source is approaching
      and decrease at the other points. Observe how the directions
      of the field vectors change so that they are always away from
      or towards the source, depending on whether the source charge
      is positive or negative, respectively.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Click in the applet window to set a field
      point, and change the Vector Length Multiplier slider setting
      if necessary, so that there is a visible field vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the Field-Line button <img src=
      "../images/FieldLine.gif" alt="Field Line" align="top"> to
      draw a green field line through the field point, and click
      the Equipotential-Line button <img src=
      "../images/EquipotentialLine.gif" alt="Equipotential Line"
      align="top"> to draw a red equipotential line through the
      field point. The equipotential "lines" are actually circles
      in this case. You should something like the image in Figure 1
      below.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Without resetting the applet, repeat the
      process from Exercise 1 for two more field points until you
      have three field points with field lines and equipotential
      lines through them as illustrated in Figure 2 below.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Without resetting the applet, add a fourth
      field point and vector, as in Figure 2 above, and move the
      field point in two ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        along a field line,
      </li>
      <li>
        along an equipotential line.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Observe the direction of the field vector. It should always
      be along an electric field line and always be perpendicular
      to an electric potential line.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the Field-Grid-Point button <img src=
      "../images/Grid.gif" alt="Grid" align="top">, and drag the
      source so that it is centered between four neighboring grid
      points. You should see something like the image in Figure 3
      below. Adjust the setting of the Vector Length Multiplier
      slider if necessary.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="../images/MFGrid.gif" alt="Grid Points">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The grid is an array of grey field points. There are no
      charges located at these points. The purpose of the grid is
      to make it easy to observe the electric field due to the
      source charge at a large number of field points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Move the source charge through the grid of
      field points and observe the changes in the field vectors. As
      noted above, the applet is designed so that the source object
      cannot be dragged over a field point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click in the applet window to create an additional field
      point, as shown in Figure 3. You can draw an electric field
      line and an equipotential line through this point as before.
      If you move the source or change the value of its charge,
      these lines will be erased.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continue with the state of the applet as
      in Exercise 2, and don't click Reset. Instead, click REWIND
      <img src="../images/Rewind.gif" alt="Rewind" align="top">.
      This should remove the grid, any extra field points, and any
      field and equipotential lines. It should not change the
      slider settings and the position of the source charge.
