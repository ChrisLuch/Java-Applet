            <p>
              Rewind does not alter the last position of the source

          When the Field-Point-Grid button <img src=

          a rectangular array of field points is displayed with
          corresponding field vectors due to the source charge as
          shown in the image above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The source charge can be dragged with the mouse. However,
          the applet is designed so that the source charge cannot
          be dragged over the source points. (The applet is
          intended to show the 1/<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>-property of
          the field. This property applies only for field points
          outside of the source charge ball of non-zero radius.)

          When a field point is established by clicking in the
          applet window with the mouse, the field point is drawn as
          a small circle in green and the electric field vector at
          that point is automatically drawn as well. If you then
          click on the Field-Line button <img src=

          field line through the field point will be drawn in
          green.

        <p>
          When another field point is selected with the mouse, the
          color of the previous field point and field vector is
          changed to grey while the new field point and vector are
          shown in green.

          The image above shows three field points with
          corresponding field vectors in grey and the most recent
          field point and field vector in green. Field lines are
          drawn through the first three field points. About the red
          circles see the next point on Equipotential Lines.

          When another field point is selected with the mouse, the

          The preceding image under "3. Field Line" shows three

          Clicking on the slider to the left or right of the slider

          Clicking on the Input Dialog button <img src=

          entering an exact value for the slider setting. The
          dialog for the <i>Source Charge</i>-slider is illustrated
          below. The range in which values can be entered, from -50
          C to 50 C in this case, is indicated above the data entry
          field.

          The charge on the source can be positive or negative or
          zero. This nature of the charge of the source object is
          indicated by the colors red, grey, or blue, respectively.
          In the case illustrated here, the source chare is
          positive so that the source is colored red.

          The Vector Length Scale slider allows you to adjust the
          lengths of the arrows representing the field vectors by
          dragging the slider tab. The slider adjusts all vector
          arrows by the same scale factor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The slider is qualitative and does not have the usual
          functionality of exact data entry by means of a data
          entry field. However, the slider can be adjusted one step
          at a time by clicking on the slider to the left or to the
          right of the slider tab.

          To establish a field point outside the source object,
          click in the applet window with the mouse. The field
          point will be drawn as a small circle in green and the
          electric field vector at that point will automatically be
          drawn as well, in green. The image above shows one such
          field point and field vector.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also shows three more field points and field vectors
          in grey. When a new field point is selected with the
          mouse, the color of the previous field point and field
          vector is changed to grey while the latest field point
          and vector are shown in green.
