<div class="title">Assumptions - Electric Field Due To A Point Charge</div>

<p><div class="sectionheading">The applet simulates the electric field
 and the equipotential lines (Curves) accompanying an electric point
 charge. </div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">



    <p>The applet makes the following assumptions:

	 <p><ul>

	 <li>The source object, i.e., the object responsible for the
	 existence of the electric field is a perfect sphere of non-zero
	 radius..</li>

	 <li>The charge density of the source object is uniform throughout
	 the object.</li>

	 </ul>

	 <p>A consequence of these assumptions is that, for points outside
	 the source, the magnitude of the electric field depends on the
	 distance <i>d</i> of the field point from the center of the source
	 as if the source were a point particle at the center of the source
	 with all of the source charge concentrated on this particle. 

	 <p>For field points outside the source object, the applet
	 therefore simulates the electric field of a point source, which
	 varies with <i>d</i> like 1/<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>.

	 <p>The applet does not permit field points inside the finite
	 source object.  Its purpose is to simulate the electric field due
	 to a point charge.
