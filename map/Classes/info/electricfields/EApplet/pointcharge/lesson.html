 <blockquote>Any two particles carrying electric charges
 <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and
 <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> exert electrostatic forces on each other.  If
 the two charges have the same sign, the particles exert repulsive
 forces on each other.  If they have opposite sign, the forces are
 attractive.  The force exerted on Particle 1 has the same magnitude
 <i>F</i> as the force exerted on Particle 2, equal to

 <p align="center"><i>F</i> =

 <p><li><a name="Theorem"><b>Theorem on Forces Exerted by Spheres</b></a>  

 <p>Coulomb's law of electrostatics describes forces that two
 <b>point</b> particles exert on each other.  A spherical object, like
 the source object in the present applet, is not a point particle, and
 Coulomb's law does not directly give the force exerted by a spherical
 object on a (point) particle.  However, one can prove the following
 theorem which states that a charged sphere behaves like a point
 particle under certain conditions.

 <p><blockquote>Let <img src="../images/F.gif" alt="vector F"
 align="bottom"> denote the electrostatic force exerted by a charged
 sphere of radius <i>R</i> on a particle at a distance <i>d</i> from
 the center of the sphere.  If the total charge <i>Q</i> residing on
 the sphere is uniformly distributed throughout the sphere and if
 <i>d</i> is equal to or greater than <i>R</i>, i.e., if the particle
 is outside the sphere, then <img src="../images/F.gif" alt="vector F"
 align="bottom"> is the same as if all of the charge <i>Q</i> were
 concentrated at the center of the sphere.  In particular, the
 magnitude <i>F</i> of this force is equal to

 <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
 width="60"><i>F</i> = <i>k|Q||q|</i> /
 <i>d</i><sup>2</sup>, <img src="../images/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"

 <blockquote>If <img src="../images/F.gif" alt="vector F"
 align="bottom"> is the electric force exerted on a test particle of
 charge <i>q</i> at some point in space, then the ratio

 <p align="center"><img src="../images/E.gif" alt="vector E" align="bottom"> = <img

 src="../images/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40"> (4)</p>

 <p>is called the <i>electric field</i> at the given point.</blockquote>

 <p><u>Comment 1</u>.  Since the force <img src="../images/F.gif"
 alt="vector F" align="bottom"> is proportional to the charge
 <i>q</i>, the electric field <img src="../images/E.gif" alt="vector
 E" align="bottom"> is independent of <i>q</i> and characterizes an
 "electric intensity" at the given point in space that is present
 without the test particle and does not depend on any properties of
 the test particle.

<p><u>Comment 2</u>.  The SI-unit of the electric field is N/C.

 <p><u>Comment 3</u>.  The electric field is defined at all
 points in space.  It is therefore not a single vector, but a
 "vector-valued function defined on space".  This simply means that to
 describe the electric field one must specify the vectors <img
 src="../images/E.gif" alt="vector E" align="bottom"> at all points in space.

 <p><u>Comment 4</u>.  An <i>electric field line</i> is a line (not a
 straight line in general) that indicates the direction of the
 electric field vectors at points along the line.

 <blockquote>The electric field vector at a given point along an
 <i>electric field line</i> is tangential to the line at that
 point.</blockquote></li>

  <p><li><a name="ElPotential"><b>Electric Potential and Equipotential
  Lines</b></a>

  <p>A static electric field, i.e., a field accompanying one or more
  source charges at rest, has the property that it can be derived from
  a simpler field called the <i>electric potential</i>.  The electric
  potential field is simpler because it is a scalar field, not a
  vector field like the electric field.  The electric potential field
  assigns a scalar quantity to any given point in space called the
  <i>electric potential at that point</i>. The SI-unit of the electric
  potential is the volt (V).

  <p>How can a scalar field give rise to a vector field?  A static
  electric field is constructed from its electric potential field as
  follows.

  <blockquote>Suppose you know the electric potential field and want
  to know the electric field vector at a given point P.  Look at the
  electric potential in the neighborhood of P. Find the direction
  leading away from P in which the electric potential decreases more
  rapidly than in any other direction.  This is the direction in which
  the electric vector at P points.

  <p>The magnitude <i>E</i> of the electric vector at P is equal to
  the magnitude of the distance-rate-of-change of the electric
  potential,

  <p align="center"><img src="../images/ElFieldDefinition.gif"> <img
 src="../images/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40"> <img
 src="../images/MFFive.gif"></p>

  <p>where |&Delta;<i>V</i>| / <i>d</i> is
  calculated in the direction of the electric field vector at P.  Here
  |&Delta;<i>V</i>| equals |<i>V</i>(P') -
  <i>V</i>(P)| where P' is a point near P that lies in the direction
  of most rapid change of <i>V</i> away from P and <i>d</i> is the
  distance between P and P'.

  <p>If the electric potential is constant throughout a small
  neighborhood of P or if the electric potential has a maximum or
  minimum at P, the electric field at P is zero.</blockquote>

  <p><u>Comment 1</u>. Equation (5) implies the SI-unit V/m for the
  electric field.  Another SI-unit for the electric field is N/C, as
  mentioned in Comment 2 under "Definition of Electric Field and
  Electric Field Lines" above.

  <p><u>Comment 2</u>. In general, the potential in the vicinity of a
  given point P will be decreasing in some directions, increasing in
  others, and remain constant along a line through P dividing the
  directions of decreasing and increasing potential.  This dividing
  line is the "equipotential line" through P.

  <blockquote>An <i>equipotential line</i> is a line along which the
  electric potential is constant.</blockquote>

  <p>Such lines are not straight in general.  In the present case of a
  point charge field, the equipotential lines are circles that have
  the point charge at their center.

  <p>Note that one is dealing with equipotential <b>lines</b> when
  considering only <b>two</b> dimensions.  In three dimensions, one has
  equipotential <b>surfaces</b>.  In the present case of a point
  charge field, the equipotential surfaces are spheres that have the
  point charge at their center.

  <p><u>Comment 3</u>. The electric field vector at a given point is
  always perpendicular to the equipotential line through that point.
  As a consequence, electric field lines and equipotential lines cross
  at right angles at any given point.

  <p><u>Comment 4</u>. Electric equipotential lines are analogous to
  lines of equal altitude on a topographic map.  The steepest downhill
  direction is the direction in which these lines are closest
  together, i.e., the direction in which the altitude decreases most
  rapidly.  This is the direction of the field vector.</li>

Vectors</div></a>

  <p><b>Task 1</b>.  Under "Laws, Theorems, Definitions"                                   
  above, read the sections on 

  <p><ul>

  <li>"Coulomb's Law of Electrostatics",</li>

  <li>"Theorem on Electric Forces Exerted by Charged Spheres",</li>

  <li>"Definition of Electric Field and Electric Field Lines".</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>. From Eqs. (4) and (5), derive an expression for the magnitude <i>E</i>
  of the electric field due to a sphere of uniform charge density and
  total charge <i>Q</i> at a distance <i>d</i> from the center of the
  sphere, if the field point is outside the sphere.

  <p>What is the direction of the field vector at this point for
  different signs of the source charge?

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  Taking magnitudes on both sides of Definition
  (4) and substituting Expression (3) for <i>F</i> gives the
  following expression for <i>E</i>:

 <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="60"><i>E</i> =
 <i>k|Q|</i> / <i>d</i><sup>2</sup>, <img src="../images/small.gif"
 height="1" width="40"><i>d</i> > <i>R</i>.<img
 src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (6)</p>
  
  <p>The direction of the field vector <img src="../images/E.gif"
  alt="vector E" align="bottom"> is towards the center of the sphere
  if <i>Q</i> is negative and away from the center of the sphere if
  <i>Q</i> is positive.  Why?  Base your answer on the definition of
  the electric field and the direction of the force exerted by the
  source on a positive test charge.

  <p><b>Exercise 2</b>.  RESET <img src="../images/Reset.gif"
  alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet.

  <p>Click on a point in the applet window to create a field point
  with electric field vector at that point.  Drag the point and
  observe how the vector changes.  Make sketches of what you observe,
  paying attention to both the magnitude and the direction of the
  electric field vector and the locations of the source and the field
  point.  Are your observations about magnitude and direction of the
  field vector consistent with the answer to Exercise 1?

  <p>You may want to adjust the setting of the Vector Length
  Multiplier slider to have the field vectors represented by longer arrows.

  <p><b>Exercise 3</b>. Without making any changes in the settings of
  the applet used in Exercise 2, drag the source while keeping the
  field point fixed.  Make the same kinds of observations as in
  Exercise 2, and compare these observations to those in Exercise 2.

  <p>Discuss what determines the magnitude and direction of the field
  vector: the location of the source or the location of the field
  point?  Can one change both the location of the source and of the
  field point so that the electric field vector remains unchanged?

  <p><b>Exercise 4</b>. Suppose the arrow representing the field
  vector is 144 pixels long when the field point is at <i>d</i> =
  <i>R</i>, i.e., at the surface of the source sphere.

  <p>Write down the lengths of the field arrows you would expect at
  <i>d</i> = 2<i>R</i>, <i>d</i> = 3<i>R</i>, and <i>d</i> = 4<i>R</i>
  assuming the magnitude of the electric field were proportional to

  <p><ul>

  <li>1/<i>d</i></li>

  <li>1/<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>.</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>Answer</b>. The lengths are, in the same order as above,

  <p><ul>

  <li>1/<i>d</i>: 72 pix, 48 pix, 36 pix</li>

  <li>1/<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>: 36 pix, 16 pix, 9 pix.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Explain how these values are obtained.

  <p><b>Exercise 5</b>. RESET the applet, and set the source charge to
  <i>Q</i> = 50.  Make sure the Vector Length Multiplier is set to 1.

  <p>Set four field points as illustrated in Figure 1 below, i.e., at
  the 0<sup>o</sup>, 90<sup>o</sup>, 180<sup>o</sup>, and
  270<sup>o</sup> positions at distances from the center of the source
  equal to <i>R</i>, 2<i>R</i>, 3<i>R</i>, and 4<i>R</i>,
  respectively.  If you do this approximately, this is good enough for
  the present purpose.

  <p align="center"><img src="../images/MFENWS.gif"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

  <p>Discuss which one of the two progressions of arrow lengths
  derived in Exercise 4 fits those shown by the applet.  Therefore,
  what is the <i>d</i>-dependence of the electric field?

  <p>To make it easier for you to judge the lengths of the arrows,
  play with the Vector Length Multiplier slider.  E.g., if you reset
  this slider from 1 to 4, all arrows become four times as long.  An
  arrow whose length is supposed to be one fourth that of another
  arrow will then become as long as that other arrow was originally
  before the slider was reset.

  <p><b>Exercise 6</b>. Display the Field-Point-Grid to again judge
  the dependence of the electric field on the distance <i>d</i> of a
  field point from the center of the source.

  <p>Center the source between four adjoining field points as in Figure 2 below.

  <p align="center"><img src="../images/MFGrid.gif" alt="Grid"></p>
                                                                                                     
  <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>  

  <p>Discuss if the lengths of the field arrows are consistent with the
  <i>d</i>-dependence found in Exercise 5.

  alt="Back To Top" border ="0" align="top"></a></p>

<p> <a name="FieldLines"><div class="sectionheading">Electric Field
Lines</div></a>

  <p>RESET <img src="../images/Reset.gif" alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet.

  <p><b>Question 1</b>. Click at a point in the applet window to set a
  field point and electric field vector at that point.  What is the
  direction of the electric field line through that point?

  <p>Click the Field-Line button <img src="../images/FieldLine.gif"
  align="top"> to check your answer.

  <p><b>Question 2</b>.  What will be the direction of the electric
  field vector at some other point on the electric field line from
  Question 1?

  <p>Click at another such point and check your answer.

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>.  RESET the applet.

  <p>Set field points on an imagined circle surrounding the source
  roughly 45<sup>o</sup> apart, at angles roughly equal to
  0<sup>o</sup>, 45<sup>o</sup>, 90<sup>o</sup>, 135<sup>o</sup>, etc.
  After setting each field point, draw the electric field line through
  the point.

  <p>Describe the electric field line pattern of a point source.

<p> <a name="EquipotentialLines"><div
class="sectionheading">Equipotential Lines</div></a>

  <p><b>Task 1</b>.  Under "Laws, Theorems, Definitions" above, read
  the section on "Electric Potential and Equipotential Lines".

  <p><b>Question 1</b>.  Set up two field points and draw the
  equipotential lines through these field points such that the two
  circles are close to each other.  See Figure 3 below for an example.

  <p align="center"><img src="../images/MFTwoEquipots.gif"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 3</b></p>

  <p>Move a field point along one of the equipotential lines
  (circles).  Why is the field vector at any point always
  perpendicular to the equipotential line through that point?

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  The electric field vector points in the direction
  of largest rate of decrease of electric potential.  This is in the
  direction in which one has to move the shortest distance to change
  the potential by a given amount.  This direction is perpendicular to
  the equipotential lines, which is the radial direction in the case
  of a point source.

  <p><b>Question 2</b>.  Which one of the two equipotential lines in
  Figure 3 has the larger electric potential?

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  The equipotential line with the smaller radius
  has the larger potential because the electric field points from high
  to low potential.

  <p><b>Question 3</b>.  Suppose the potentials on the two
  equipotential lines in Figure 3 are 19V and 17 V, respectively, and
  that the radii of the two circles are equal to 10.0 cm and 10.5 cm,
  respectively.  What is the approximate magnitude <i>E</i> of the
  electric field at the green field point in Figure 3?

  <p><b>Answer</b>. Expression (5), without the limit operation,
  gives, in SI-units,

  <p align="center"><i>E</i> = |<font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>|
  / <i>d</i> = |17 - 19| / (10.5&times;10<sup>-2</sup> -
  10.0&times;10<sup>-2</sup>) = 400 V/m. <img src="../images/small.gif"
  alt="space" height="1" width="40">(7)

  <p>This value for <i>E</i> is not exact, approximate only, because
  the calculation is not using infinitesimal changes.

  <p><b>Question 4</b>.  The SI-unit for the electric field was given
  as N/C in Comment 2 following Definition (4) and as V/m in Comment 1
  following Definition (5).  Equate the two units and obtain an
  expression for the SI-unit volt (V) of the electric potential in
  terms of other SI-units.  Your answer should involve the energy unit
  joule (J).  Note that <nobr>1 J = 1 N m</nobr>.

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  1 V = 1 N m / C = 1 J/C.
