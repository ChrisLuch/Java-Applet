<div class="title">Assumptions - Electric Field of a Line Charge</div>

    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates the electric field of one or several
      electric point charges arranged along a straight line or the
      field of an infinitely extended straight line charge.
    </div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">



    <p>The applet makes the following assumptions:

	 <p><ul>

	 <li>Electric charge is distributed uniformly along an
	 infinitely long wire.</li>

	 <p><li>When short finite segments of the wire are selected, the
	 applet, in calculating the electric field due to these
	 segments, assumes the charges on the segments to be
	 concentrated at the center points of the segments.</li>
 
         </ul>

  <p>
    The applet displays everything in only two dimensions.  These are
    represented by an <i>x</i> and a <i>y</i> axis.  The
    charge-carrying wire is laid out along the <i>x</i>-axis and the
    field points at which the electric field vectors are simulated lie
    in the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> plane, as do the field vectors
    themselves.  Therefore the <i>z</i>-coordinate of a field point
    and the <i>z</i>-component of any electric field vector are zero
    always and are simply omitted, for brevity's sake.
  </p>
  <p>
    Restricting everything to the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> plane involves no
    loss in generality because of the rotational symmetry of the
    electric field around the wire.
