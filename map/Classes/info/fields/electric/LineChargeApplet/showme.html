      This page is designed to get you started using the applet.
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on
      this page are to be done in the applet. You may need to
      toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if your

      Select the Segments button <img src="Segments.gif" alt=
      "Segments" align="top"> and the Grid button <img src= "Grid.gif"
      alt="Grid" align="top">. Click on the wire at a point
      immediately to the right of the origin to select the first wire
      segment to the right of the origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deselect the Resultant button <img src="resultant.gif"

         <img src="vectors.gif" alt="Vectors" align="top"> instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure the field point is still at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) =
      (1.0, 0.5) m. Adjust the scale slider to a setting around
      500. You should see the configuration shown in Figure 1
      below, with a red arrow representing the electric field
      vector at the given field point. In calculating this electric
      field vector, the applet assumes that all of the charge on
      the selected segment is concentrated at the midpoint of the
      segment.

      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, select the
      Data button <img src="Data.gif" alt="Data" align="top">. Drag
      the Data box so that all of it can be seen, as in Figure 2
      below.

      Note the coordinates of the field point P, the total electric
      field vector at P, and particulars of the wire segment
      selected. The present segment, immediately to the right of the
      origin, has the label <i>i</i> = 0. The center of the segment is
      at <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> = 0.10 m, and the electric field at P
      due to this segment has the components
      (<i>E<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>E<sub>y</sub></i>) = (7.41,
      4.12)&times;10<sup>9</sup> V/m. The total electric field vector
      <img src="E.gif" alt="vector E" align="bottom"> at P, due to all
      selected segments, is displayed at the bottom of the Data
      box. It has the same value as the field vector due to Segment 0
      in this case, because only this one segment is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note the listing of the segment width <i>s</i> in the third
      line of the Data box. Each segment is 0.20 m wide, and
      Segment 0 extends from <i>x</i> = 0 to <i>x</i> = 0.20 m,
      which implies its center is at <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> = 0.10 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, without making
      any other changes in the applet's settings, vary the line
      charge density <font face="symbol">l</font> by means of the
      slider. As <font face="symbol">l</font> increases, the length
      of the red arrow representing the field vector at P should
      increase. Also choose some negative values for <font face=
      "symbol">l</font>. The colors of the selected segment and of
      the arrow representing the field vector at P should change
      from red to blue and the arrow should reverse direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Continuing from Exercise 3, click on the
      field point and drag it along a horizontal line parallel to the
      <i>x</i>-axis at <i>y</i> = 0.5 m. Observe changes in the field
      vector, as represented by the red or blue arrow and as shown in
      the Data box. The field vector should always be pointing away
      from or towards the selected segment, depending on whether the
      charge on the segment is positive or negative, and it should be
      largest in magnitude when the field point is closest to the
      center of the segment, i.e., when the <i>x</i>-coordinate of the
      point is equal to 0.10 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Return the field point to
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (1.0, 0.5) m and set the charge density to
      the value <font face="symbol">l</font> = 5.00 C/m. Select the
      Vector Components button <img src="vectorscomp.gif" alt=

      800. You should see the configuration shown in Figure 4
      below. The two red arrows represent the electric field
      vectors at the given field point due to the two selected
      segments. The green arrow represents the resultant field
      vector, i.e., the sum (superposition) of the field vectors
      due to the two selected segments.

      Drag the field point and change the line charge density, and

      you observe. Is the green resultant vector always a diagonal
      in the parallelogram spanned by the two red vectors?

      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Get the numerical values of the two field

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset"

      selected, which means the applet assumes that the entire
      infinite wire, extending beyond the applet window on either
      side, is uniformly charged. The green arrow representing the
      resultant at the given field point should be displayed.
      Display the Grid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Data box, and record the value of the total electric
      field due to the infinite line displayed there. Then select the
      Segments button <img src="Segments.gif" alt= "Segments"
      align="top">, and select all segments available in the window by
      clicking on the left-most segment and dragging with the mouse
      from the left to the right over all segments. The entire wire
      should be highlighted in red. Record the value of the total
      electric field now shown in the Data box. It should be close to,
      but not exactly equal to that for the infinite wire because when
      the Segments button is selected only the charge on the segments
      within the applet window, not the entire infinite line charge,
      contribute to the electric field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the field point horizontally (parallel to the
      <i>x</i>-axis) while the Segments button is selected, and
      observe how the resultant field vector changes direction. Then
      deselect the Segments button, and observe how the resultant
      field vector stays vertical no matter where the field point is
      located.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, keep the
      Segments button and all wire segments selected, hide the
      green resultant vector, but display the red segment vectors.
      Set the scale slider to a setting around 300. Hide the Data
      box. If you place the field point at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) =
