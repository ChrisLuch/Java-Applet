<div class="title">Assumptions - Magnetic Field Due To A Current In A Straight Wire
</div>

    <div class="sectionheading">
    The applet simulates the magnetic field due to a current in a
    straight wire and the contributions to the field from the current
    in short segments of the wire.
    </div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

    <p>The applet makes the following assumption.

	 <p>When individual segments of the wire are selected, the
	 applet, in calculating the magnetic field due to these
	 segments, takes the position of a segment to be that of the
	 center point of the segment.
