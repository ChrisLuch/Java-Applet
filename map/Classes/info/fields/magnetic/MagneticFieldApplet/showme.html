      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src="../MFimages/Reset.gif" alt="Reset"
      align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the Segments button <img src="../MFimages/MFSegments.gif"
      alt= "Segments" align="top">. Click on the wire in the center of
      the window to select the segment at the origin, Segment 0.  To
      help you in selecting the segment at the origin, display the
      Data box <img src="../MFimages/Data.gif" alt="Data" align="top">
      and check the coordinates of the segment you have selected.  If
      you have selected the wrong segment, deselect it by clicking on
      the selected segment and click on another segment.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also check which Segment you have selected by choosing
      the "Coordinate View" mode by selecting the appropriate radio
      button <img src="../MFimages/MFMode.gif" alt="Mode"
      align="top">. However, segments can only be selected in the
      "Physical Relative View" mode.  Segment 0 is shown in copper
      color in Figure 1 below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose the "Coordinate View" mode to move the field point P to
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>) = (-0.30, 0.30, 0.40) m, or close
      to it.  To adjust the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates, drag P
      in the right portion of the window.  To adjust the
      <i>z</i>-coordinate, drag P in the left portion of the window.
      Figure 1 shows how P is situated.  The Data box will show the
      coordinates of P.

         align="top"> and the Field Line button <img
         src="../MFimages/FieldLine.gif" alt="FieldLine" align="top">
         are selected.  If you set the Scale slider to 1,000 and if
         the current is set to 5.00 A, you should see an image like
         that in Figure 2 below.

      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, display the Data
      box and drag the box so that all of it can be seen, as in Figure 3
      below.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Both the Cartesian and the cylindrical coordinates of the field
      point P are listed. The definition of these coordinates can be
      inspected in the Coordinate View mode.  See Figure 1 above.
    </p>
    <p>
     The insert in the Data box has detailed information about the
     selected segment: its label, <i>i</i> = 0, the location of its
     center point, <i>Z<sub>i</sub></i> = 0, the distance from its
     center point to the given field point, <i>d<sub>i</sub></i> =
     0.58 m, the angle between the positive <i>x</i>-axis and the line
     from the center of the segment to the field point, <font
     face="symbol">a</font><sub>i</sub> = 46.7<sup>o</sup>, and the
     magnitude of the magnetic field at the field point due to the
     segment, <i>B<sub>i</sub></i> = 2.14&times;10<sup>-7</sup> T.  To
     see the angle <font face="symbol">a</font><sub>0</sub> and the
     distance <i>d</i><sub>0</sub> illustrated, select the Coordinate
     View mode and move the mouse pointer onto the selected segment.
   </p>
   <p>
     Below this insert, the magnitude <i>B</i> of the total magnetic
field at the given field point, <i>B</i> = 2.14&times;10<sup>-7</sup>
T, is listed. It has the same value as the field vector due to Segment
0 in this case, because only this one segment is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The segment width <i>s</i> is listed in the third line of the
      Data box. Each segment is 0.20 m wide.  E.g., Segment 0 has its
      center is at <i>Z<sub>i</sub></i> = 0 and therefore extends from
      <i>z</i> = -0.10 m to <i>z</i> = 0.10 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, without making
      any other changes in the applet's settings, vary the current
      <font face="symbol"><i>I</i></font> by means of the slider. As
      <font face="symbol"><i>I</i></font> increases, the length of the
      blue arrow representing the field vector at P should
      increase. Also choose some negative values for <font face=
      "symbol"><i>I</i></font>. The blue arrows in both the Side View
      and Front View should reverse direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Change the current direction definition from "conventional" to
      "electron" by using the Current Drop-Down menu <img
      src="../MFimages/MFCurrentDirection.gif" alt="Current Direction"
      align="top">.  Note that the arrows on the wire indicating
      current direction reverse, but that the field vector does not
      reverse direction.  Changing the definition of current direction
      has no effect on physical reality.  You may want to click the
      Play button <img src="../MFimages/Play.gif" alt="Play"
      align="top"> to animate the current direction indication.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Continuing from Exercise 3, click on the
      field point and drag it along a horizontal line parallel to the
      <i>z</i>-axis at <i>y</i> = 0.30 m. To do so, drag the field
      point in the left portion (Side View) of the applet window.
      Observe changes in the field vector, by observing the blue
      arrows and the values in the Data box. Only the magnitude of the
      field vector should be changing, not its direction.  The
      magnitude should be largest when the field point is
      closest to the center of the segment, i.e., when the
      <i>z</i>-coordinate of the point is equal to 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the right portion of the applet window, drag the
      <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> projection of the field point, and observe
      changes in the direction and magnitude of the field vector.  The
      direction should always be tangential to the circular magnetic
      field line centered on the wire, i.e., at right angles to the
      radius of this circle.  The magnitude should increase as the
      distance <i>r</i> of the field point from the wire decreases,
      and vice versa.

    </p>
    <p>
      Select the Segments button <img src="../MFimages/MFSegments.gif" alt=
      "Segments" align="top">. Select two Segments,
      Segment 0 at the origin and Segment
      5 centered at <i>z</i> = 1.00 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose the "Coordinate View" mode to move the field point P to
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>) = (-0.30, 0.30, 0.40) m, or close
      to it, as in Exercise 1 of the preceding section.  Switching
      back to the Physical Reality View mode, you should see a display
      like that when only Segment 0 is selected.  That image is
      reproduced once more as Figure 4 below.

     The only difference is that this time the blue arrows are a bit
     longer.  To observe the contribution of Segment 5 to the total
     field at P, click on Segment 5 to deselect it, then click on it
     once more to select it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag the field point parallel to the <i>z</i>-axis, and observe
      the changes in the field vector as point P moves past the two
      selected segments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Get the numerical values of the magnitudes of
      the two field vectors due to Segments 0 and 5 from the Data
      box. Do they add up to the total magnitude <i>B</i> of the field
      vector listed at the bottom of the Data box?  Note that it is
      permissible in this case to add the magnitudes of the individual
      vectors because the field vectors due to all segments point in
      the same direction.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src="../MFimages/Reset.gif"
      alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet. The Segments button should
      not be selected. In this case, the applet calculates and displays
      the total magnetic field due to current in the entire infinite
      wire, extending beyond the applet window on either side. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Data box, and record the value of the magnitude of
      the total magnetic field due to the infinite line current. Then
      select the Segments button <img src="../MFimages/MFSegments.gif"
      alt= "Segments" align="top">, and select all segments available
      in the window by clicking on the left-most segment and dragging
      with the mouse from the left to the right over all segments. The
      entire wire should be highlighted in copper color. Record the
      value of the magnitude of the total magnetic field now shown in
      the Data box. It should be close to, but not exactly equal to
      that for the infinite wire because when the Segments button is
      selected the applet calculates the contributions to the magnetic
      field only from the current in the selected segments within the
      applet window, not from the current in the entire infinite wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the field point horizontally (parallel to the
      <i>z</i>-axis) while the Segments button is selected, and
      observe how the resultant field vector changes in
      magnitude. Then deselect the Segments button, and observe how
      the resultant field vector keeps its magnitude no matter where
      the field point is located, as long as the field point is moved
      at a fixed distance from the wire.
