    <p>
      This page is designed to get you started using the applet.
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on
      this page are to be done in the applet. You may need to
      toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if your
      screen space is limited.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src="../MFimages/Reset.gif" alt="Reset"
      align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the Loops button <img src="../MFimages/Loops.gif" alt=
      "Loops" align="top">. Click on the loop in the center of the
      series of coaxial loops, Loop 0.  To help you in selecting the
      right loop, you can either display the Grid <img
      src="../MFimages/Grid.gif" alt="Grid" align="top"> or display
      the Data box <img src="../MFimages/Data.gif" alt="Data"
      align="top"> and check the <i>x</i>-coordinate of the loop you
      have selected.  If you have selected the wrong loop, deselect it
      by clicking on the selected loop and click on another loop.
    </p>
    <p>
         Set the Scale slider to 100 and the current to 5.0 A.  Make
         sure the Vector button <img src="../MFimages/Vector.gif"
         alt="Vector" align="top"> is selected.  Drag the field point
         to (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>) = (0, -2.0, 0) cm (using the
         Grid and Data box as guides), and select the Field Line
         button <img src="../MFimages/FieldLine.gif" alt="FieldLine"
         align="top">.  The field line through the field point will be
         drawn in blue.  Click on several more field points, and have
         the applet draw the field lines through these points.  Only
         the last field line drawn will be shown in blue, the others
         in grey.  If you clicked at the field points at the locations
         of the tail ends of the arrows shown in Figure 1 below, you
         should see a pattern of field lines like that in Figure 1.
         The arrows represent the field vectors at the selected field
         points.

      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, drag the field
      point to (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>) = (0.040, -0.060, 0) m.  If the Field
      Line button is still selected, the field line will be dragged
      along, but it may take a second or two because of the large
      number of calculations required to draw a field line in this
      applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Data box, and drag the box so that all of it can be
      seen, as in Figure 2 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>
     Note the insert in the Data box with detailed information about
     the selected loop: its label, <i>i</i> = 0, the location of its
     center point, <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> = 0, and the
     <i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i> components of the magnetic field
     vector at the field point due to the current in the loop,
     (<i>B<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>B<sub>y</sub></i>,<i>B<sub>z</sub></i>)<sub>i</sub>
     = (59.12, -148.87, 0)&times;10<sup>-7</sup> T.
   </p>
   <p>
     Below this insert, the total magnetic field vector <img
src="../MFimages/Bcap.gif" alt="vector B" align="bottom"> at the given
field point, <i>B</i> = (59.12, -148.87, 0)&times;10<sup>-7</sup> T,
is listed. It is equal to the field vector due to Segment 0
in this case, because only this one segment is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, without making
      any other changes in the applet's settings, vary the current
      <font face="symbol"><i>I</i></font> by means of the slider. As
      <font face="symbol"><i>I</i></font> increases, the length of the
      arrows representing field vectors should increase. Also choose
      some negative values for <font face=
      "symbol"><i>I</i></font>. The field arrows should reverse
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Continuing from Exercise 3, drag the field
      point along its field line. Make sure the Field Line button is
      still selected.  Observe that the field vector always remains
      tangential to the field line.  Note that the field line gets
      redrawn as you move the field point.  This may take a second or
      two.

    </p>
    <p>
      Select the Loops button <img src="../MFimages/Loops.gif" alt=
      "Loops" align="top">. Select two loops, Loop -4 at <i>x</i> =
      -0.04 m and Loop 2 at <i>x</i> = 0.02 m.  Drag the field point
      to (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>) = (2.0, -10.0, 0) cm and let the
      applet draw the field line through this point.  Set the Vector
      Length scale to 400.  The field line and field vector should
      look like that in Figure 3 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">

      <b>Figure 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Now deselect Loop 2 and, without moving the field point, let the
     applet draw the field line again.  Observe the change.  Then
     re-select Loop 2 and let the applet draw the field line through
     the field point once more.  The image in Figure 3 should be restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Get the numerical values of the two field
      vectors due to Loops -4 and 2 from the Data box. Do the two
      vectors add up to the total magnetic field vector <img
      src="../MFimages/Bcap.gif" alt="vector B" align="bottom"> listed
      at the bottom of the Data box?

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src="../MFimages/Reset.gif"
      alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet. The Loops button should not
      be selected. In this case, the applet calculates and displays
      the total magnetic field due to current in all twenty-one loops.
      (One can achieve the same by selecting the Segments button and
      then selecting all loops.  In the latter case, the Data box will
      display information about the individual loops.  In the former,
      it will not.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the Speed/Accuracy Slider <img
               src="../MFimages/LoopAccuracySlider.gif"
               alt="Speed/Accuracy Slider" align="top"> all the way to
               the left, so that the calculation speed has its maximum
               possible value of 5 and the calculation accuracy its
               minimum possible value of 1.  Move the field point to
               (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>) = (0, -14.0, 0) cm or
               close to this point.  (Let the Grid and Data box guide
               you in setting the point.)  You may want to choose a
               scale setting of around 200 to get a reasonable length
               for the field arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let the applet draw the field line through the given point.  You
     will find that the line does not close.  The reason is that, at
     the lowest accuracy setting of the Speed/Accuracy slider, the
     calculation is not accurate enough for this particular field
     point.  As soon as you select the Field Line button and the field
     line is being calculated and drawn, the Stop button <img
     src="../MFimages/Stop.gif" alt="Stop" align="top"> becomes
     active.  Click this button to halt the calculation when the field
     line has missed the original field point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the tab of the Speed/Accuracy slider all the way to the
      right, so that the calculation sppeed has its minimum setting of
      1 and the calculation accuracy its maximum setting of 5.
      Deselect the Field Line button and select it again.  The field
      line through the given field point at
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>) = (0, -14.0, 0) cm will be redrawn.
      Be patient!  It may take a minute or longer, depending on the
      speed of your computer, but the line will close and the
      calculation will stop by itself.  As soon as the calculation
      stops, the Stop button becomes inactive.
