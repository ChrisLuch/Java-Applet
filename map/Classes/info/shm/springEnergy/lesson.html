    <p>
      <b>Prerequisites</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should be familiar with the general properties of
      simple harmonic motion (SHM), in particular, the way in which
      the displacement and the velocity of the oscillating object
      depend on time. Students should be familiar with the concepts of
      kinetic and potential energy and energy conservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Learning Outcomes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students will learn how to use energy conservation to obtain
      information about the potential energy of a system consisting
      of a vertical spring, a block suspended from it, and the earth.
      They will be able to describe the time dependence of the
      potential energy when the block is oscillating and to explain
      how the potential energy depends on the displacement of the
      weight from its equilibrium position.  They will learn that the
      energy of the spring-block-earth system is proportional to the
      square of the amplitude of oscillation of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should know how the applet functions, as described
      in Help and ShowMe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in
      the following text are to be done in the applet. You may need
      to toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if
      your screen space is limited.

      Kinetic Energy as a Function of Time
    </div>
    <p>
      The kinetic energy <i>KE</i> of weighted spring varies in time
      when the block is oscillating up and down. Let's find out how
      <i>KE</i> depends on <i>t</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src= "../springImages/Reset.gif"
      alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
	 <p>
		Set the spring constant to <i>k</i> = 200 N/m, and keep the mass
      and the amplitude at their default values of <i>m</i> = 1.25 kg
      and <i>A</i> = 0.20 m, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion from its default position, which has the block
      in its top position, and observe the block's motion. 
    </p>
	 <p>
		Based on your qualitative observation of the block's motion,
      sketch graphs of position vs. time (<i>y</i> vs. <i>t</i>) and
      velocity vs. time (<i>v<sub>y</sub></i> vs. <i>t</i>) for the
      block. <i>y</i> is the position of the center of the block. The
      <i>y</i>-axis increases in the upward direction, with
      <i>y</i> = 0 at the block's equilibrium position. On the graphs,
      mark the points where the block passes its top, bottom, and
      equilibrium positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When done, display the applet's <i>y</i> vs. <i>t</i> and
      <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> vs. <i>t</i> graphs to check your
      graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, REWIND the applet
      and PLAY the motion. Observe the size of the kinetic energy
      column during the motion, and, based on this qualitative
      observation, sketch the kinetic energy <i>KE</i> of the
      oscillating block vs. <i>t</i>. You may find it helpful to STEP
      through the motion. 
	 </p>
	 <p>
		On the graph, mark the points where the block passes its top,
      bottom, and equilibrium positions.  Make sure your graph is
      consistent with the <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> vs. <i>t</i> graph
      obtained in Exercise 1. When done, display the applet's
      <i>KE</i> vs. <i>t</i> graph to check your graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Write down general expressions in symbols
      for the block's position <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>) and velocity
      <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>(<i>t</i>) at time <i>t</i> for the
      motion played in Exercises 1 and 2 in terms of the amplitude
      <i>A</i>, angular frequency <font face="symbol">w</font>, and
      time <i>t</i>. If you have difficulty with this Exercise,
      review the Lesson "Simple Harmonic Motion (Vertical
      Spring)" accompanying the applet "Simple Harmonic Motion".
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the expression for <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>(<i>t</i>),
      write down an expression for <i>KE</i>(<i>t</i>) in terms of
      <i>A</i>, <font face="symbol">w</font>, and the mass
      <i>m</i>, and, of course, <i>t</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. For the kinetic energy, you should obtain

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. REWIND the applet, and STEP through the
      motion until the block is as close to its equilibrium point
      as possible (the energy column would be entirely red at the
      equilibrium point). Record the value of the kinetic energy at
      this point from the Data box. Calculate this value using
      Equ.(1) above and compare your result to the value of
      <i>KE</i> in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculate the kinetic energy at another instant during the
      block's motion. Also, click Rewind, change some of system
      parameters, and Step the system to a time of your choice.
      Calculate the kinetic energy at this time from Equ.(1). Compare
      your values with those displayed in the Data box.

    <p>
      The mechanical energy <i>E</i>, <i>energy</i> for short, of the
      spring-block-earth system stays constant during the system's
      motion (if the motion is undamped, as it is in the applet). One
      says the energy is <i>conserved</i>. The energy is the sum of
      kinetic and potential energy,
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="240"><i>E</i> = <i>KE</i> + <i>PE</i>. <img src=
      "../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "40">(2)
    </p>
    <p>
      Play the motion and observe how there is an ongoing
      conversion of potential into kinetic energy or vice versa
      during the motion such that the sum of the two energies
      remains constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, you will use Equ.(2) together with Equ.(1)
      to obtain information about the time dependence of the
      potential energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Set the spring constant
      to <i>k</i> = 200 N/m, and keep the mass and the amplitude at
      their default values of <i>m</i> = 1.25 kg and <i>A</i> =
      0.20 m, respectively. These are the same settings as at the
      beginning of the preceding section.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion, and sketch a graph of the potential energy as
      function of time. Mark the points where the block passes its
      top, bottom, and equilibrium positions. When done, compare
      your sketch to the graph plotted by the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, determine the
      value of the potential energy at the block's top and bottom
      positions and the value of the mechanical energy as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential energy of any system is defined up to an additive
      constant whose value one can choose freely to suit one's
      convenience. In the applet, as is commonly done for the present
      system, this constant is chosen so that the potential energy of
      the spring-block-earth system is 0 when the block is at its
      equilibrium position. Therefore, at this point, the mechanical
      energy <i>E</i> is equal to the kinetic energy
      <i>KE</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the block is either at its top or bottom positions, the
      block is momentarily at rest and therefore its kinetic
      energy equal to zero. Thus, Equ.(2) implies that <i>E</i> =
      <i>PE</i> at this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, since <i>E</i> is constant during the motion, the
      potential energy at the top or bottom is equal to the kinetic
      energy when the block is passing its equilibrium position,
      which is the maximum kinetic energy:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="200"><i>PE<sub>top,bottom</sub></i> = <i>E</i> =
      <i>KE<sub>max</sub></i>. <img src="../springImages/small.gif"
      alt="space" height="1" width="40">(3)
    </p>
    <p>
      Use Equ.(3) combined with Expression (1) for the kinetic
      energy, to derive a general expression for the potential
      energy at the top or bottom of the motion and for the energy
      <i>E</i>. Hint: what is the maximum value of
      <i>sin</i><sup>2</sup> <font face="symbol">w</font><i>t</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Since the maximum value of the sine function
      and that of its square are equal to 1, Equ.(1) implies
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="200"><i>PE<sub>top,bottom</sub></i> = <i>E</i> =
      (<i>m</i>/2)<i>A</i><sup>2</sup><font face=
      "symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup>. <img src=
      "../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "40">(4)
    </p>
    <p>
      Use Equ.(4) to calculate the values of
      <i>PE<sub>top,bottom</sub></i> and <i>E</i> for the present
      applet settings. Compare your results to the values in the
      Data box and also with the value of the kinetic energy near
      the equilibrium point determined in Exercise 4 of the
      previous section. The latter may not be quite equal to
      <i>KE<sub>max</sub></i> if you stopped the motion not exactly
      at the equilbrium point.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. In the Lesson "Simple Harmonic Motion
      (Vertical Spring)" accompanying the applet "Simple Harmonic
      Motion" it is shown that the angular frequency <font
      face="symbol">w</font> is related to the spring constant
      <i>k</i> and the mass <i>m</i> of the block by

      <i>k</i> / <i>m</i> .<img src="../springImages/small.gif"
         alt="space" height="1" width="40">(5)
    </p>
    <p>
      Substitute this expression for <font face=
      "symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup> into Equ.(4) to obtain an
      expression for the energy in terms of <i>k</i> and <i>A</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"

      "../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "40">(6)
    </p>
    <p>
      Substitute the present values into Equ.(6) and check if the
      resulting value of <i>PE<sub>top,bottom</sub></i> agrees with
      that obtained in Exercise 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Substitute Expression (1) for the kinetic
      energy into Equ.(2) to obtain an expression for the potential
      energy at time <i>t</i>. Into the resulting equation for
      <i>PE</i>(<i>t</i>), substitute Expression (4) for <i>E</i>
      and simplify. You should obtain the following equation for
      <i>PE</i>(<i>t</i>):

      Potential Energy as Function of Position

    <p>
      In Exercise 3 of the section "Kinetic Energy as a Function of
      Time", you were asked to write down a general expression for
      the position of the block as a function of time, assuming
      the motion starts at <i>t</i> = 0 with the block in its top
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equation is

    </p>
    <p>
      Substitute this expression for <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>) into

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Sketch <i>PE</i> vs. <i>y</i> between
      <i>y</i> = -<i>A</i> and <i>y</i> = <i>A</i>. What is the name
      of this kind of a curve?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Discuss if Equ.(12) is consistent with
      Equ.(6).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. RESET the applet. Set the spring constant to
      <i>k</i> = 200 N/m, and keep the mass and the amplitude at their
      default values of <i>m</i> = 1.25 kg and <i>A</i> = 0.20 m,
      respectively. These settings were used previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag the block all the way to the bottom, by clicking on the
      block and dragging. The block should be at <i>y</i> = -0.20
      m. Calculate the corresponding value of <i>PE</i> from Equ.(12),
      and compare your result to the value in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag the block upward to <i>y</i> = -0.15 m, and again
      calculate <i>PE</i>. Observe the blue potential energy column
      and the rate at which it changes. Continue doing this for
      <i>y</i> = -0.10 m, <i>y</i> = -0.05 m, <i>y</i> = 0, and then
      for positive <i>y</i> in steps of 0.05 m. Make a table of the
      values of <i>PE</i> vs. <i>y</i>. Discuss where the rate at
      which <i>PE</i> changes is greatest: near the bottom of the
      oscillation, or near the top or near the equilibrium point.

    <p>
      For each 0.05-m interval, calculate the average slope <font

      "symbol">D</font><i>y</i> of the potential energy curve over the
      interval from <i>y</i> to <i>y</i> + 0.05 m, and compare this
      average slope to the net force acting on the block at the
      midpoint of this interval, i.e., at <i>y</i> + 0.025 m. To
      calculate the net force, use the expression for the net force
      <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> derived in the Lesson accompanying the

      <b>Answer</b>. You should find that

      <img src="../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="200"><i>F<sub>y,mid</sub></i> = - <font face=

    </p>
    <p>
      for each of the 0.05-m intervals. Note the minus sign in this
      equation. When the slope of the potential energy curve is
      positive, the net force is negative. Does that make sense?
    </p>
    <p>
      You could make the <i>y</i>-interval smaller and smaller and
      would find Equ.(14) to be true always. In the limit of
      vanishing interval size, the average slope over an interval
      would become the slope at a point. This way one can prove
      that
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The net force acting on the block at a given displacement
      <i>y</i> from equilibrium is equal to the negative slope at
      that point of the potential energy taken as a function of
      <i>y</i>.
    </blockquote>

      The mathematical symbol for slope (also called
      <i>derivative</i>), as applied to the present case, is
      <i>dPE</i> / <i>dy</i>. With this notation,

    <p>
      Equ.(6) above gives the energy of the spring-block-earth
      system in terms of the amplitude <i>A</i>, and the spring
      constant <i>k</i>. Note that the energy depends on the
      <b>square</b> of the amplitude, not the first power of the
      amplitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet, and set the spring
      constant to <i>k</i> = 200 N/m and the amplitude to <i>A</i>
      = 0.10 m. Display the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Record the value of the energy <i>E</i>. Vary the amplitude
      with the slider from 0.10 m to 0.30 m, and record the
      corresponding values of <i>E</i> for several values of the
      amplitude along the way. Plot a graph of <i>E</i> vs.
      <i>A</i> and demonstrate that it exhibits the quadratic
      dependence on <i>A</i> from Equ.(6).
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment</u>. The quadratic dependence of the energy on the
      square of the amplitude is typical of all simple harmonic
      oscillations. E.g., electromagnetic radiation consists of
      waves that locally are harmonic oscillations. Thus, the
      intensity of electromagnetic radiation, i.e., the amount of
      energy transmitted per unit time, is proportional to the
      <b>square</b> of the amplitude of the oscillations of the
      electromagnetic field of the radiation.
