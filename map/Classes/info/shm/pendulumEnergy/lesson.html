      <b>Prerequisites</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet simulates the motion of a simple pendulum in its
		simple-harmonic-motion (SHM) approximation.  Students should
		be familiar with the general properties of
      SHM and the sense in which SHM is a
      good approximation to the motion of a simple pendulum at
      small amplitude. In particular, they should be familiar with
      the SHM-approximation to the displacement and velocity of a
      simple pendulum as a function of time. Students should be
      familiar with the concepts of kinetic and potential energy
      and energy conservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Learning Outcomes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students will learn how to use energy conservation to obtain
      information about the potential energy of a simple pendulum.
      They will be able to describe the time dependence of the
      potential energy when the pendulum is oscillating and to
      explain how the potential energy depends on the displacement
      of the pendulum from its equilibrium position. They will
      learn that the energy of the simple pendulum is proportional
      to the square of the amplitude of oscillation of the
      pendulum.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should know how the applet functions, as described
      in Help and ShowMe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in
      the following text are to be done in the applet. You may need
      to toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if
      your screen space is limited.

      Figure 1 below illustrates the <i>x</i>-axis that will be
      used to describe the motion of the simple pendulum.

      We will use the bob's <i>x</i>-coordinate as the pendulum's
      position. The origin of the <i>x</i>-axis, <i>x</i> = 0, is
      at the bob's equilibrium position at the bottom of the swing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For small amplitudes, the time dependence of the bob's
      <i>x</i>-coordinate is to a good approximation SHM. In the
      simulation and in this lesson, the time dependence of the
      bob's <i>x</i>-coordinate is taken to be SHM exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kinetic energy <i>KE</i> of a simple pendulum is a
      function of the time <i>t</i>. Let's find out how <i>KE</i>
      depends on <i>t</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Set the amplitude to
      <i>A</i> = 0.50 m and the length of the pendulum to <i>L</i> =
      3.00 m. Keep the mass of the pendulum bob and the magnitude of
      the acceleration due to gravity at their default values of
      <i>m</i> = 0.50 kg and <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>,
      respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion from the pendulum's default position, which has
      the pendulum bob at its right-most position, at <i>x</i> =
      <i>A</i>, and observe the motion. Sketch graphs of both the
      bob's position (<i>x</i>) and velocity (<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>)
      vs. time (<i>t</i>). On the graphs, mark the points where the
      bob passes its far right, far left, and equilibrium positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When done, display the applet's <i>x</i> vs. <i>t</i> and
      <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> vs. <i>t</i> graphs to check your
      graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, REWIND the applet
      and PLAY the motion again. Observe the size of the kinetic
      energy column during the motion, and sketch the kinetic energy
      <i>KE</i> of the oscillating pendulum vs. <i>t</i>.  You may
      find it helpful to Step through the motion. On the graph, mark
      the points where the bob passes its far right, far left, and
      equilibrium positions. Make sure your graph is consistent with
      the <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> vs. <i>t</i> graph obtained in Exercise
      1. When done, display the applet's
      <i>KE</i> vs. <i>t</i> graph to check your graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Write down general expressions in symbols
      for the bob's position <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>) and velocity
      <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(<i>t</i>) at time <i>t</i> for the
      motion played in Exercises 1 and 2 in terms of the amplitude
      <i>A</i>, angular frequency <font face="symbol">w</font>, and
      time <i>t</i>. If you have difficulty with this Exercise,
      review the Lesson accompanying the applet "Simple Harmonic
      Motion (Pendulum)".
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the expression for <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(<i>t</i>),
      write down an expression for <i>KE</i>(<i>t</i>) in terms of
      <i>A</i>, &omega;, the mass <i>m</i>,
      and, of course, <i>t</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. For the kinetic energy, you should obtain

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. REWIND the applet, and STEP through the
      motion until the bob is as close to its equilibrium point as
      possible (the energy column would be entirely red at the
      equilibrium point). Record the value of the kinetic energy at
      this point from the Data box. Calculate this value using
      Equ.(1) above and compare your result to the value of
      <i>KE</i> in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculate the kinetic energy at another instant during the
      pendulum's motion. Also, click Rewind, change some of system
      parameters, and Step the system to a time of your choice.
      Calculate the kinetic energy at these times from Equ.(1).
      Compare your values with those displayed in the Data box.

      Potential Energy as a Function of Time
    </div>
    <p>
      The potential energy of the simple pendulum is strictly
      speaking the gravitational potential energy of the
      pendulum-earth system. We will refer to it as the "potential
      energy of the pendulum" for short. Similarly, we will refer
      to the energy of the pendulum-earth system as the "energy of
      the pendulum".
    </p>
    <p>
      The mechanical energy <i>E</i>, <i>energy</i> for short, of
      the simple pendulum stays constant during the pendulum's
      motion (if the motion is undamped, as it is in the applet).
      One says the energy is <i>conserved</i>. The energy is the
      sum of kinetic and potential energy,
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../pendulumImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="240"><i>E</i> = <i>KE</i> + <i>PE</i>. <img src=
      "../pendulumImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
         width="40">(2)
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion and observe how there is an ongoing
      conversion of potential into kinetic energy or vice versa
      during the motion such that the sum of the two energies
      remains constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, you will use Equ.(2) together with Equ.(1)
      to obtain information about the time dependence of the
      potential energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Set the amplitude to
      <i>A</i> = 0.50 m and the length of the pendulum to <i>L</i> =
      3.00 m. Keep the mass of the pendulum bob and the magnitude of
      the acceleration due to gravity at their default values of
      <i>m</i> = 0.50 kg and <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>,
      respectively. These are the same settings as at the beginning of
      the preceding section.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion, and sketch a graph of the potential energy
      as function of time. Mark the points where the bob passes its
      far right, far left, and equilibrium positions. When done,
      compare your sketch to the graph drawn by the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, determine the
      value of the potential energy at the bob's far right and far
      left positions and the value of the mechanical energy as
      follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential energy of any system is defined up to an
      additive constant whose value one can choose freely to suit
      one's convenience. In the applet, as is commonly done for the
      present system, this constant is chosen so that the potential
      energy of the pendulum is 0 when the pendulum is at its
      equilibrium position. Therefore, at this point, the
      mechanical energy <i>E</i> is equal to the kinetic energy
      <i>KE</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the bob is either at its far right or far left
      positions, the bob is momentarily at rest and therefore its
      kinetic energy equal to zero. Thus, Equ.(2) implies that
      <i>E</i> = <i>PE</i> at this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, since <i>E</i> is constant during the motion, the
      potential energy at the far right or far left is equal to the
      kinetic energy when the bob is passing its equilibrium
      position, which is the maximum kinetic energy:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../pendulumImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="200"><i>PE<sub>right,left</sub></i> = <i>E</i> =
      <i>KE<sub>max</sub></i>. <img src=
      "../pendulumImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
         width="40">(3)
    </p>
    <p>
      Use Equ.(3) combined with Expression (1) for the kinetic
      energy, to derive a general expression for the potential
      energy at the far right or far left of the motion and for the
      energy <i>E</i>. Hint: what is the maximum value of
      <i>sin</i><sup>2</sup> &omega;<i>t</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Since the maximum value of the sine function
      and that of its square are equal to 1, Equ.(1) implies
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../pendulumImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="200"><i>PE<sub>right,left</sub></i> = <i>E</i> =
      (<i>m</i>/2)<i>A</i><sup>2</sup>&omega;<sup>2</sup>. <img src=
      "../pendulumImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
         width="40">(4)
    </p>
    <p>
      Use Equ.(4) to calculate the values of
      <i>PE<sub>right,left</sub></i> and <i>E</i> for the present
      applet settings. Compare your results to the values in the
      Data box and also with the value of the kinetic energy near
      the equilibrium point determined in Exercise 4 of the
      previous section. The latter may not be quite equal to
      <i>KE<sub>max</sub></i> if you stopped the motion not exactly
      at the equilbrium point.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. In the Lesson "Simple Harmonic Motion
      (Pendulum)" accompanying the Pendulum applet it is shown that
      the angular frequency &omega; is related to
      the magnitude due to gravity <i>g</i> and the length <i>L</i> of
      the pendulum by
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../pendulumImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="240">&omega;<sup>2</sup> =
      <i>g</i> / <i>L</i> .<img src="../pendulumImages/small.gif"
      alt="space" height="1" width="40">(5)
    </p>
    <p>
      Substitute this expression for &omega;<sup>2</sup> into Equ.(4) to obtain an
      expression for the energy in terms of <i>m</i>, <i>g</i>,
      <i>L</i>, and <i>A</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is
    </p>

      <img src="../pendulumImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="200"><i>PE<sub>right,left</sub></i> = <i>E</i> =

         width="40">(6)
    </p>
    <p>
      Substitute the present values into Equ.(6) and check if the
      resulting value of <i>PE<sub>right,left</sub></i> agrees with
      that obtained in Exercise 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Substitute Expression (1) for the kinetic
      energy into Equ.(2) to obtain an expression for the potential
      energy at time <i>t</i>. Into the resulting equation for
      <i>PE</i>(<i>t</i>), substitute Expression (4) for <i>E</i>
      and simplify. You should obtain the following equation for
      <i>PE</i>(<i>t</i>):

      are consistent. Discuss whether Equ.(10) has the right
      behavior at the far right, far left, and equilibrium
      positions of the motion.

    <p>
      PLAY and PAUSE the motion at some instant, and use Equ.(10)

      In Exercise 3 of the section "Kinetic Energy as a Function of
      Time", you were asked to write down a general expression for
      the position of the pendulum bob as a function of time,
      assuming the motion starts at <i>t</i> = 0 with the bob in

      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Discuss if Equ.(12) is consistent with

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. RESET the applet. Set the amplitude to
      <i>A</i> = 0.50 m and the length of the pendulum to <i>L</i> =

    <p>
      Drag the pendulum bob all the way to the left, by clicking on
      the bob and dragging. The bob should be at <i>x</i> = -0.50

      Drag the weight to the right to <i>x</i> = -0.40 m, and again
      calculate <i>PE</i>. Observe the blue potential energy column

      <i>x</i> = -0.30 m, <i>x</i> = -0.20 m, <i>x</i> = -0.10 m,
      <i>x</i> = 0, and then for positive <i>x</i> in steps of 0.10
      m. Make a table of the values of <i>PE</i> vs. <i>x</i>.
      Discuss where the rate at which <i>PE</i> changes is
      greatest: near the far right of the oscillation, or near the
      far left or near the equilibrium point.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each 0.10-m interval, calculate the average slope
      &Delta;<i>PE</i> / &Delta;<i>x</i> of the potential energy curve over
      the interval from <i>x</i> to <i>x</i> + 0.10 m, and compare
      this average slope to the <i>x</i>-component of the net force
      acting on the bob at the midpoint of this interval, i.e., at
      <i>x</i> + 0.05 m. To calculate the net force, use the
      expression for the acceleration <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> derived

      for each of the 0.10-m intervals. Note the minus sign in this
      equation. When the slope of the potential energy curve is
      positive, the net force is negative. Does that make sense?

    <p>
      You could make the <i>x</i>-interval smaller and smaller and
      would find Equ.(14) to be true always. In the limit of
      vanishing interval size, the average slope over an interval
      would become the slope at a point. This way one can prove
      that

    <blockquote>
      The <i>x</i>-component of the net force acting on the
      pendulum bob at a given displacement <i>x</i> from
      equilibrium is equal to the negative slope at that point of
      the potential energy taken as a function of <i>x</i>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The mathematical symbol for slope (also called
      <i>derivative</i>), as applied to the present case, is
      <i>dPE</i> / <i>dx</i>. With this notation,

      Energy as a Function of Amplitude

      Equ.(6) above gives the energy of the simple pendulum in
      terms of the amplitude <i>A</i>, the mass <i>m</i>, the
      magnitude <i>g</i> of the acceleration due to gravity, and
      the length <i>L</i> of the pendulum. Note that the energy
      depends on the <b>square</b> of the amplitude, not the first
      power of the amplitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet, and set the amplitude to
      <i>A</i> = 0.17 m, the length of the pendulum to <i>L</i> =
      3.00 m, and the mass of the pendulum bob to <i>m</i> = 1.00
      kg. Keep the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity at
      its default value of <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Display
      the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Record the value of the energy <i>E</i>. Vary the amplitude
      with the slider from 0.17 m to 0.51 m, i.e., by a factor of
      3, and record the corresponding values of <i>E</i> for
      several values of the amplitude along the way. Plot a graph
      of <i>E</i> vs. <i>A</i> and demonstrate that it exhibits the
      quadratic dependence on <i>A</i> from Equ.(6).
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment</u>. The pendulum's potential energy is really
      gravitational potential energy. The gravitational potential
      energy of the bob is equal to <i>mgh</i> where <i>h</i> is
      the bob's elevation above the bob's bottom position. One can
      show that this expression is consistent with Expression (12)
      for the potential energy by showing that, for small
      amplitudes,
