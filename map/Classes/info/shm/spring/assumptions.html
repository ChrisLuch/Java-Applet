<div class="title">Assumptions - Simple Harmonic Motion (Vertical Spring)</div>

<p><div class="sectionheading">The applet shows a weighted vertical
spring performing simple harmonic motion.  The motion is shown to be
identical to projected uniform circular motion.</div>


<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p>It is assumed that

<p><ul>

<li>the spring obeys Hooke's Law throughout the spring's range of
motion, i.e., that the amount by which the spring is stretched from
its unstretched length is proportional to the magnitude of the force
applied to the spring;</li>

<p><li>the spring is massless;</li>

<p><li>the system is frictionless.</li>

</ul>
