    <p>
      <b>Prerequisites</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should be familiar with the concepts of position,
      velocity, and acceleration, at the vector level and in
      uniform circular motion, and have a working knowledge of the
      sine and cosine functions for angles of any size. They should
      be familiar with the radian measure of angles and Newton's
      second law of motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Learning Outcomes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students will learn that simple harmonic motion is projected
      uniform circular motion and will be able to use this
      understanding to make a quantitative analysis of
      displacement, velocity, and acceleration in simple harmonic
      motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should know how the applet functions, as described
      in Help and ShowMe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in
      the following text are to be done in the applet. You may need
      to toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if
      your screen space is limited.

      Overview and Definition of Simple Harmonic Motion
    </div>
    <p>
      Starting from the definition of simple harmonic motion (SHM),
      the Lesson will investigate the kinematical properties of
      SHM, in particular, the relationship between amplitude and
      period and the dependence of position, velocity, and
      acceleration on time. It will turn out that the acceleration
      and the position are related simply to each other. This
      relationship implies that a weighted spring obeying Hooke's
      Law will perform SHM. This is the system simulated in the
      applet.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <b>Definition</b>. <i>Simple harmonic motion</i> is a motion
      identical to the projection of a uniform circular motion onto
      a straight line. 
      <p>
        The straight line can have any orientation, e.g., vertical
        or horizontal.

      Amplitude and Period in SHM

    <p>
      An example of a system that performs SHM is a weighted
      spring. This is the system simulated in the applet. (It is
      assumed that the spring obeys Hooke's law.) The reason that
      weighted springs behave like this will be explained at the
      end of the Lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section you will investigate how the period of a
      weighted oscillating spring depends on the amplitude of the
      motion. The result you will find is characteristic of all
      SHM.

    <p>
      Keep the default settings of the spring constant, <i>k</i> =
      80 N/m, and mass of the suspended weight, <i>m</i> = 1.25 kg,
      but change the amplitude <i>A</i> to 0.10 m.

      <li>
        the position vs. time graph for the weight,
      </li>
      <li>
        the Data box.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The weight's position <i>y</i> is measured on a <i>y</i>-axis
      that points vertically upward and has its origin <i>y</i> = 0
      at the weight's equilibrium point, as illustrated in Figure 1
      below. The weight's position <i>y</i> is also its
      displacement from the equilibrium point. The Data box
      displays both the time <i>t</i> elapsed and the position
      <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Task 1</b>. Measure the period <i>T</i> of oscillation of
      the weighted spring. The period is the time interval over
      which the motion repeats itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To measure the period, run the motion until it completes one
      entire cycle. You can determine the point at which the motion
      starts to repeat itself either by watching the graph or
      watching the printout of <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>) in the Data box.
      The cycle repeats itself at the point where
      <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>) = 0 coming from negative values of
      <i>y</i>. You may want to approach this point by stepping
      into it after having run the motion to some point that is
      fairly close.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Result</b>. The experimental value you should find for
      <i>T</i> is close to 0.78 s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theoretical value can be obtained from the following two
      equations
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <font face="symbol">w</font> = <img src=
      "../springImages/root16.gif" alt="Root" align=

    </p>and 
    <p align="center">

      "symbol">p</font>/<i>T</i>. <img src=
      "../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "50"> (2)
    </p>
    <p>
      These equations will be derived later on. For the moment, you
      are free to use them. The variable <font face=
      "symbol">w</font> is called <i>angular frequency</i>. The
      letter <font face="symbol">w</font> is the Greek letter
      "omega".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Task 2</b>. Use Equations (1) and (2) and the given
      settings to calculate the period <i>T</i> of the oscillation.
      Compare the result to what you found "experimentally".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Task 3</b>. Repeat Tasks 1 and 2 with an amplitude setting
      <i>A</i> = 0.30 m. What is your conclusion about the
      relationship between amplitude and period? You may want to
      verify your conclusion by repeating Tasks 1 and 2 with a
      third value for the amplitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment</u>. The fact that the period does not depend on
      the amplitude is a characteristic feature of SHM. This
      feature may seem quite surprising. One might have expected
      the period to increase with the amplitude. However, the
      independence of the period on the amplitude is a natural
      consequence of SHM understood as projected uniform circular
      motion. SHM as projected uniform circular motion is dealt
      with in the next section.

      Display the reference circle and the position vector of the
      reference point along with its vertical component vector.
      Note that the vertical component vector is also the position
      vector of the weight, measured from the weight's equilibrium
      position at <i>y</i> = 0. Initially, when the weight is at
      the equilibrium point, the component vector is zero and
      represented by just a dot, but you will see it being non-zero
      when you carry out Exercise 1.
    </p>

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Run the motion. Observe
    </p>

      Display the horizontal line connecting the tips of the two

      In your Notebook, describe the motion of the weight while the

    <p>
      Use Equation (3) together with appropriate data from the Data
      box to obtain a value for the angular velocity of the
      reference point. Compare it with the value of <font face=

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. The angular velocity <font face=
      "symbol">w</font> of the revolving reference point is equal
      to the angular frequency <font face="symbol">w</font> of the
      weight's oscillatory motion defined by Equation (2) above.
      This is why we can use the same symbol <font face=
      "symbol">w</font> for both quantities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The angular frequency of the weighted spring can be
      calculated from the spring constant <i>k</i> and the mass
      <i>m</i> by using Equation (1) above. Use this equation to
      calculate <font face="symbol">w</font> from the settings on
      the applet, and compare the result with the value of
      <font face="symbol">w</font> from Exercise 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Task 1</b>. Prove in general that the angular velocity of
      the revolving reference point is equal to the angular
      frequency of the weight's oscillatory motion. To do so, start
      from Equation (3) for the angular velocity of the revolving
      reference point and show that this angular velocity is equal
      to the angular frequency of the oscillating weight as given
      by Equation (2).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. When the revolving point makes one revolution,
      the oscillating weight goes through one cycle of its
      oscillation. The time required for this cycle is called the
      <i>period</i> and is denoted by <i>T</i>. The time <i>T</i>
      is also the time required for the reference point to complete
      one revolution. The change in angular position of the
      reference point during one revolution is equal to
         2<font face="symbol">p</font> rad. Therefore, by Equation
         (1), the revolving point's angular velocity is equal to
         2<font face="symbol">p</font>/<i>T</i>, which is equal to
         the angular frequency in Equation (2). Note that the unit
         "rad" is dimensionless and does not need to be indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Task 2</b>. Write down an expression for the weight's
      position <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>) at time <i>t</i> in terms of the
      phase angle <font face="symbol">q</font>(<i>t</i>) and the
      radius <i>A</i> of the reference circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      See Figure 1 for an illustration of the phase angle.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will need a trigonometric function, defined for arbitrary
      angles. For a definition of the sine and cosine functions,
      see <a href="#SineCosine">Sine and Cosine Functions</a> in
      the Appendix to this Lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The weight's <i>y</i>-coordinate is identical
      with that of the reference point. If the reference circle had
      radius 1, the definition of the sine function would imply
      <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>sin</i> <font face=
      "symbol">q</font>(<i>t</i>). Since the radius is not 1, but
      <i>A</i>, we have to multiply this expression for
      <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>) by <i>A</i>. Thus,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>A sin</i> <font face=
      "symbol">q</font>(<i>t</i>) . <img src=
      "../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "50"> (4)
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that Equation (4) implies that the maximum value of
      <i>y</i> is <i>A</i>, because the maximum value of the sine
      function is 1. The maximum displacement from equilibrium of
      an oscillatory motion is called the <i>amplitude</i> of the
      motion. Thus, the amplitude of the weight's motion is equal
      to the radius <i>A</i> of the reference circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Use Equation (4) to calculate the value of
      the weight's displacement <i>y</i> at the time <i>t</i> when
      you stopped the motion. Take the value of <font face=
      "symbol">q</font>(<i>t</i>) displayed in the Data box and the
      value of the amplitude from the Amplitude slider. Compare
      your answer with that displayed in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. REWIND the applet. Don't change the
      settings of <i>k</i> and <i>m</i>. PLAY the motion, and PAUSE
      it. Using the value of the time elapsed <i>t</i> shown in the
      Data box and the value of the angular velocity determined in
      Exercise 2, calculate the value of the angle <font face=
      "symbol">q</font>(<i>t</i>). Compare your result with the
      value shown in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hint: Enter the given data into the definition of angular
      velocity given by Equation (3) and solve for <i>t</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Task 3</b>. Derive a general expression for the angle
      <font face="symbol">q</font>(<i>t</i>) in terms of the
      angular velocity and the time <i>t</i>, assuming the motion
      starts with <font face="symbol">q</font>(0) = 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Equation (3) written out in detail says
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <font face="symbol">w</font> = [<font face=
      "symbol">q</font>(<i>t</i>) - <font face=

    </p>
    <p>
      Substituting the initial condition, this simplifies to
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <font face="symbol">w</font> = [<font face=

    <p>
      <u>Comment 1</u>. The answer to Exercise 3 is obtained by
      substituting the values for <font face="symbol">w</font> and
      <i>t</i> on the right-hand side of Equation (7).
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 2</u>. Equation (7) is analogous to the equation

      <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>). Compare your result with the value shown
      in the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Task 4</b>. The value of <font face="symbol">w</font> used
      so far is 8.00 rad/s. Substitute this value into Equation (9)
      and determine the period of the weight's oscillation from the
      resulting equation, using the periodicity of the sine
      function.

    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. When <font face="symbol">w</font> = 8.00 rad/s
      is substituted into Equation (9), one gets

    <p>
      It is not customary to include the unit "rad" in equations,
      and the unit will not be indicated either in the following
      with values of angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At <i>t</i> = 0, we have <i>y</i> = 0. At <i>t</i> =

      acceleration in relation to the weight's displacement. In
      particular, discuss the acceleration when the weight is at
      the top, when it is on its way down before reaching the
      equilibrium point, when it is going through the equilibrium
      point, when it continues on its way down past the equilbrium
      point, when it is at its lowest point, and again all the way
      to the top.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Compare Equations (26) and (17). The only
      difference between the two right-hand sides is an extra
      factor of -<font face="symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup> on the
      right-hand side of Equation (27). Therefore,

      Equation (28) is characteristic of SHM. Whenever a motion
      satisfies this equation, it is SHM. Since the acceleration is
      related to the net force acting on the oscillator, Equation
      (28) implies a relationship between the net force and the
      displacement. This will be the topic of the next and final
      section.

      The Dynamics of SHM
    </div>
    <p>
      In the preceding sections the kinematical properties of SHM
      were developed from the definition of SHM as projected
      uniform circular motion. This is basically a mathematical
      exercise. Physics deals with the behaviour of real systems.
      So, are there any real systems that perform SHM? How do we
      find them? The applet pretends that a weighted spring
      performs SHM. How do we know that this is true? These
      questions will be answered in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      To answer these questions we need to consider the dynamics,
      i.e., the forces that give rise to SHM, and then look for
      systems in which these forces are present.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question</b>. Equation (28) is characteristic of SHM. It
      relates the acceleration in SHM to the displacement from
      equilibrium. Acceleration is related to net force, according
      to Newton's second law of motion. How must the net force
      acting on an object be related to the object's displacement
      from equilibrium if the object is to perform SHM?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Multiplying both sides of Equation (28) by the
      mass <i>m</i> of the object gives the equation
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>ma<sub>y</sub></i> = - <i>m</i><font face=
      "symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup><i>y</i> . <img src=
      "../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "50"> (29)
    </p>
    <p>
      The left-hand side of this equation is equal to the net force
      <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> acting on the object. Thus, Equation
      (29) implies that the net force must be related to the
      displacement <i>y</i> from equilibrium as follows:
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> = - <i>m</i><font face=
      "symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup><i>y</i> . <img src=
      "../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "50"> (30)
    </p>
    <p>
      Equation (30) says that in SHM the net force must be
      proportional and opposite to the displacement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment</u>. The notation <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> indicates
      that we are dealing with the <i>y</i>-component of the net
      force, not with the magnitude <i>F</i> of the force.
      <i>F<sub>y</sub></i>, like <i>y</i> and <i>a<sub>y</sub></i>
      can be both positive and negative. <i>F</i> cannot be
      negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question</b>. Does the net force exerted on a weight of
      mass <i>m</i> suspended from a spring satisfy Equation (30)?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. YES, if the spring obeys Hooke's Law. However,
      a bit of a proof is required since <b>two</b> forces are
      acting on the weight, not only the spring force. The second
      force is the gravitational force, which is constant and not
      proportional to the displacement from equilibrium. So, how
      can the net force be proportional to the displacement from
      equilibrium?
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Proof that the net force exerted on the weight obeys
      Equation (30)</u>. Figure 5 below illustrates the origin and
      orientation of the <i>y</i>-axis used to describe the
      weight's motion and the forces acting on the weight. The blue
      arrow is the weight's position vector relative to the
      equilibrium point. The tip of this vector marks the position
      <i>y</i> of the weight's center, which will be taken as
      representative of the weight's position.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 5</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Figure 5, the weight is at a negative <i>y</i> position.
      <i>y</i> = 0 marks the equilibrium point of the weight-spring
      system. <i>y</i> = <i>y<sub>0</sub></i> marks the position of
      the weight when the spring is unstretched. (At the
      equilibrium point, the spring is stretched by an amount equal
      to <i>y<sub>0</sub></i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      When the weight is at the point shown, the net force
         <img src="../springImages/F.gif" alt="vector F" align=
         "bottom"> acting on the weight is upward, trying to move
         the weight back to the equilibrium point. Thus, the upward
         force <img src="../springImages/Scap.gif" alt="vector S"
         align="bottom"> exerted on the weight by the spring has a
         larger magnitude at this point than the downward
         gravitational force <img src="../springImages/Wcap.gif"
         alt="vector W" align="bottom"> exerted on the weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      We assume that the spring obeys Hooke's Law. This means that
      the when the spring is stretched downward by a distance
      <i>s</i>, the spring exerts an upward force of magnitude
      <i>S</i> on the weight equal to
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>S</i> = <i>ks</i> <img src="../springImages/small.gif"
         alt="space" height="1" width="50"> (31)
    </p>
    <p>
      where the constant factor <i>k</i> is called the <i>spring
      constant</i> or the <i>force constant</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be seen from Figure 5 that the stretching <i>s</i> is
      given by
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>s</i> = <i>y<sub>0</sub></i> - <i>y</i> . <img src=
      "../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "50"> (32)
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the <i>y</i> component of the net force is equal to
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> = <i>S<sub>y</sub></i> +
      <i>W<sub>y</sub></i> = <i>k</i>(<i>y<sub>0</sub></i> -
      <i>y</i>) - <i>mg</i> .<img src="../springImages/small.gif"
      alt="space" height="1" width="50"> (33)
    </p>
    <p>
      Combining the two constant terms, this can be rearranged to
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> = - <i>k</i><i>y</i> +
      (<i>k</i><i>y<sub>0</sub></i> - <i>mg</i>) .<img src=
      "../springImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "50"> (34)
    </p>
    <p>
      The first term on the right-hand side has the kind of
      dependence on <i>y</i> that we want. The term in parentheses
      does not. However, that term is zero, for the following
      reason. At equilibrium, the net force on the weight is zero.
      At this point <i>S</i> has the magnitude
      <i>k</i><i>y<sub>0</sub></i>, which must be equal to the
      magnitude <i>mg</i> of the gravitational force. Thus, the
      difference <i>k</i><i>y<sub>0</sub></i> - <i>mg</i> is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can also obtain this result from Equation (34) by
      substituting the values <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> = 0 and <i>y</i>
      = 0 that characterize the equilibrium point and must satisfy
      this equation. Substituting these values, Equation (34)
      reduces to
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>k</i><i>y<sub>0</sub></i> - <i>mg</i> = 0 .<img src=

    </p>
    <p>
      Substituting Equation (35) back into Equation (34) reduces
      Equation (34) to the form of Equation (30):
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> = - <i>k</i><i>y</i> .<img src=
      "../springImages/small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (36)
    </p>
    <p>
      Equation (36) says that the <i>y</i>-dependence of the net
      force acting on a weight suspended from a spring is of the
      form required for SHM, i.e., is proportional to the
      displacement <i>y</i> from equilibrium with a minus sign in
      front. Thus, a weighted spring will perform SHM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparing the constant proportionality factors in front of

      in grey. One of the radii is always horizontal and towards

      <u>Definition of the sine</u>. Let the radius of the circle
      be equal to 1. Such a circle is called a <i>unit circle</i>.
      Then the sine of the angle <font face="symbol">q</font> is
      equal to the length of the vertical line (dotted red line in
      Figure A1) dropped onto the horizontal axis through the
      center of the circle. (In Quadrants II and III, this axis is
      not shown in Figure A1.) 
      <p>
        Imagine a pair of <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> axes with their origin

      This definition also works for angles greater than

    <p>
      Since a full circle of radius <i>r</i> has a circumference
      (arc) equal to 2<font face="symbol">p</font><i>r</i>, the
      radian measure of a full circle is 2<font face=
      "symbol">p</font><i>r</i> / <i>r</i> = 2<font face=
      "symbol">p</font> rad. Thus, we have the correspondence
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      360<sup>o</sup> = 2<font face="symbol">p</font> rad .
    </p>
    <p>
      This implies that 1 rad corresponds to 57.3<sup>o</sup>:

      1 rad = 57.3<sup>o</sup> .
