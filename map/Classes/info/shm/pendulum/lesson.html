      Lesson - Simple Harmonic Motion (Pendulum)
    </div>
    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates both simple pendulum motion and uniform
      circular motion. At the small amplitudes used in the applet,
      the pendulum's motion is very nearly simple harmonic motion
      and visually indistinguishable from projected uniform
      circular motion.

    <p>
      <b>Prerequisites</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should be familiar with the concepts of position,
      velocity, and acceleration at the vector level and have an
      understanding of these vectors in uniform circular motion.  They
      should have a working knowledge of the sine and cosine functions
      for angles of any size and should be familiar with the radian
      measure of angles and Newton's second law of motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should be familiar with the general properties of
      simple harmonic motion as covered in the lesson accompanying
      the Simple Harmonic Motion (Spring) applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Learning Outcomes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students will learn that the motion of a simple pendulum at
      small amplitudes is well approximated by projected uniform
      circular motion and therefore by simple harmonic motion. They
      will be able to use this understanding to make quantitative
      predictions about the dependence of the pendulum's period on
      the amplitude of the motion, on the mass and length of the
      pendulum, and on the magnitude of the acceleration due to
      gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should know how the applet functions, as described
      in Help and ShowMe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in
      the following text are to be done in the applet. You may need
      to toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if
      your screen space is limited.

      Simple Harmonic Motion and Pendulum Motion
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <b>Definition</b>. <i>Simple harmonic motion</i> (SHM) is a motion
      identical to the projection of a uniform circular motion onto
      a straight line. 
      <p>
        The straight line can have any orientation. In the case of
        pendulum motion, the orientation is horizontal.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Set the amplitude to
      <i>A</i> = 0.52 m and the pendulum length to <i>L</i> = 2.00
      m. Display the <i>Reference Circle</i> and the blue
      <i>Projection Line</i> that projects the reference point on
      the circle vertically upward. PLAY the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that the vertical projection line goes through the
      center of the pendulum bob at all times, as illustrated in
      Figure 1 below. This means that the motion of the pendulum is
      uniform circular motion projected onto the pendulum bob's
      circular path.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="../pendulumImages/PendulumAxis.gif" alt=
      "Pendulum and x-axis">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the real world, this would be only approximately true, but the difference
      between the pendulum's motion and the projected circular motion (SHM approximation)
      is so slight to not be noticeable for motions with small
      amplitude. For large amplitudes, corresponding to deflection angles of
		60<sup>o</sup> or more, pendulum motion is far from SHM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figure 1 shows a horizontal <i>x</i>-axis through the
      bottom of the pendulum's swing. We will use the pendulum
      bob's <i>x</i>-coordinate to describe the bob's position,
      where <i>x</i> = 0 at the bottom of the swing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the applet simulation (SHM approximation), the bob's <i>x</i>-coordinate coincides
      with the projection of the reference point onto the <i>x</i>-axis. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <b>Conclusion</b>. The position of a pendulum bob can be
      described in terms of the bob's coordinate on an
      <i>x</i>-axis like that in Figure 1. For small amplitudes, the
      time dependence of a real bob's <i>x</i>-coordinate is to a good
      approximation SHM. In the simulation and in this lesson, the
      time dependence of the bob's <i>x</i>-coordinate is taken to
      be SHM exactly.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, sketch a graph
      of <i>x</i> vs. <i>t</i> for the pendulum's motion assuming
      the motion starts on the far right, i.e., at <i>x</i> =
      <i>A</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When done, compare your <i>x</i> vs. <i>t</i> graph to that
      displayed by the applet. To do so, select Position from the
      Graph Panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the graduations on the time axis are fractions of
      2&pi; seconds. The reason for this
      choice of graduation is that the theoretical expression for
      the period <i>T</i> of a simple pendulum at small amplitude,
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../pendulumImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "180"><i>T</i> = 2&pi; <img src=
      "../pendulumImages/root16.gif" alt="root">(<i>L</i>/<i>g</i>), <img src=
      "../pendulumImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40">(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      contains a factor of 2&pi;. This way
      the graduations of the time axis can be directly related to
      the factor <img src="../pendulumImages/root16.gif" alt=
      "root">(<i>L</i>/<i>g</i>). Equation (1) is derived in the
      Appendix <a href="#Derivation">Proof that Pendulum
      Motion is Approximately SHM</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Using only symbols, write down a general
      equation for <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>) for the graph obtained in
      Exercise 2. The equation should contain the following
      constants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        amplitude <i>A</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        angular frequency &omega; (Greek letter; read: omega) of the
        circular reference motion.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The angular frequency &omega; is related to
      the period <i>T</i> by

      height="1" width="40">(2)
    </p>
    <p>
      Equ.(2) and the equations for SHM in general are dealt with
      in the Lesson accompanying the applet "Simple Harmonic Motion
      (Vertical Spring)".
    </p>
    <p>
      Substitute the present values for <i>A</i> and &omega; into the general equation for
      <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>) to get the equation for <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>)
      that applies to the specific motion you have played. Check
      that your equation gives correct values for
      <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>) by working out <i>x</i> for different values
      of <i>t</i> and comparing the values you get with those on the
      graph in the applet.

    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The general equation for <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>) is

      <u>Comment</u>. According to legend, Galileo Galilei, about
      400 years ago, timed the oscillations of a chandelier during
      a church service and found the period of oscillation to be
      independent of the amplitude. This led him to the invention
      of the pendulum clock.

    <p>
      <u>Comment</u>. The dependence of the period on the magnitude
      <i>g</i> of the acceleration due to gravity has implications for
      pendulum clocks. Since <i>g</i> varies across the surface of the

      points on the earth. Vice versa, one can use the rate at which a
      pendulum clock runs at a given location to measure <i>g</i> at

      indicated by means of a green circular arc linking two radii
      in grey. One of the radii is always horizontal and towards

      Figure A1) dropped onto the horizontal axis through the
      center of the circle. (In Quadrants II and III, this axis is
      not shown in Figure A1.) 
      <p>
        Imagine a pair of <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> axes with their origin
        at the center of the circle, the <i>x</i>-axis pointing to

      This definition also works for angles greater than

      The angle &theta; is the opening between
      the two rays labeled L1 and L2 leaving from the vertex O. The
      circular arc <i>s</i> drawn at radius <i>r</i> can be used to
      measure the radius because, for a given radius, the length of
      the arc is proportional to &theta;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The radian measure of the angle &theta;
      is defined as the ratio
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      &theta; = <i>s</i> / <i>r</i> . <img

    </p>
    <p>
      One needs to divide <i>s</i> by <i>r</i>, because <i>s</i> is
      proportional to <i>r</i> for a given angle &theta; so that only
		the ratio <i>s</i> / <i>r</i>
      is independent of <i>r</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A numerical example is illustrated in the diagram. The radian
      unit is abbreviated "rad". In dimensional analysis, the "rad"
      can be treated as a pure number because the radian measure is
      defined as a ratio of two lengths.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Degree measure</b>. The degree measure of an angle is
      based on dividing the full circle into 360 equal parts called
      degrees. The symbol for degree is "<sup>o</sup>".
    </p>
    <p>
      Since a full circle of radius <i>r</i> has a circumference
      (arc) equal to 2&pi;<i>r</i>, the
      radian measure of a full circle is 2&pi;<i>r</i> / <i>r</i> = 2&pi; rad.

      Proof that Pendulum Motion is Approximately SHM
    </div>
    <p>
      In the Lesson accompanying the applet "Simple Harmonic Motion
      (Vertical Spring)" it is shown that a point-particle moving
      along an <i>x</i>-axis performs SHM if the acceleration
      <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> of the particle is related to the particle's
      position <i>x</i> by the equation
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../pendulumImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "200"><i>a<sub>x</sub></i> = - &omega;<sup>2</sup><i>x</i> .
		<img src="../pendulumImages/small.gif"
      alt="space" height="1" width="40">(A9)
    </p>
    <p>
      where &omega;<sup>2</sup> is a constant.
      Actually, Equ.(A9) is obtained in that Lesson for a particle
      moving vertically along a <i>y</i>-axis.  Of course, SHM is
      possible along an <i>x</i>-axis as well and in that case will satisfy Equation (A9).  
    </p>
    <p>
	   If you see Equation (A9) here for the first time, you may accept
		without proof that it characterizes SHM.  The equation says that
		the acceleration <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> of a point performing SHM along an
		<i>x</i>-axis is proportional to the point's displacement <i>x</i> from an
		equilibrium position at <i>x</i> = 0 and is opposite to the displacement
		(minus sign in Equation (A9)).  The positive proportionality constant is written
      in the form &omega;<sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constant &omega; can be shown to be equal to the
      angular frequency 2&pi;/<i>T</i> of
      the motion and equal to the constant angular speed with which
      the reference point moves around the reference circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof that the motion of a simple pendulum is SHM will consist
      in the demonstration that the <i>x</i>-coordinate of the pendulum bob
      satisfies an equation of form (A9) to a very good approximation if the
		amplitude of the motion is small.
    </p>
    <p>
	   We begin by applying
      Newton's second law of motion to the bob. In order to understand clearly
		what forces are acting on the bob, let us mak a free-body diagram for the bob.
		Such a diagram is shown in Figure A4 below.
    </p>

      <b>Figure A4</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Two forces are acting on the bob, the gravitational force of
      magnitude <i>mg</i> and the force exerted by the string on
      the bob of magnitude <i>T</i>. The magnitude <i>T</i> is
      called the string tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      The components of the force exerted by the string are shown in
      pale purple. The horizontal component of this force has
      magnitude <i>T sin</i> &beta; where &beta; is the angle by which the
		pendulum string is deflected from the vertical.  Remember from Help
		and ShowMe that in this applet we distinguish between two angles:
		&beta; and the angle &theta; defining the position of the point in the
		reference circle.  In the following demonstration we will be concerned
		with the angle &beta;.
    </p>
	 <p>
		Since the horizontal component
      of the gravitational force is 0, the horizontal or
      <i>x</i>-component of the net force is equal to -<i>T sin</i>
      &beta;.  The minus sign is necessary
      because the horizontal component points in the negative
      <i>x</i>-direction. Therefore, Newton's second law applied to
      the particle gives for the <i>x</i>-component of the particle's
      acceleration the equation

    </p>
    <p>
      We need to determine the string tension <i>T</i>. It turns
      out that, for small amplitudes, <i>T</i> can simply be
      replaced by <i>mg</i> to a good approximation. The reasoning,
      which is a bit involved but a good exercise in basic physics,
      is given below. First, however, let us just accept the result
      and replace <i>T</i> by <i>mg</i> in Equ.(A10). We obtain,
      after dividing by <i>m</i>,

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Equ.(A11) gives us an expression for the acceleration, but not
      one that is of the form (A9).  To achieve that we must eliminate
      <i>sin</i> &beta; in favor of <i>x</i>.
      This can be done as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figure A5 below shows that the deflection <i>x</i> of the
      pendulum bob divided by the length <i>L</i> of the pendulum is
      equal to the tangent of the deflection angle &beta;. In symbols,
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      For a deflection angle of 10<sup>o</sup>, the tangent of the
      angle differs from the sine by about 1.5%. For smaller angles,
      this percentage difference is less. Check it with a pocket
      calculator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approximating <i>tan</i> &beta; by
      <i>sin</i> &beta; in Equ.(A12) gives us
      the approximate equation
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="../pendulumImages/small.gif" alt="space" height="1"

		<img src="../pendulumImages/small.gif"
      alt="space" height="1" width="40">(A13)
    </p>
    <p>
      Substituting this expression for <i>sin</i> &beta; into Equ.(A11)
		gives for the acceleration an
      expression that is of form (A9),
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Thus, within the approximations made, which are of the order
      of 1% for a deflection angle of 10<sup>o</sup> and less for
      smaller angles, the motion of a simple pendulum is SHM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparing the right-hand sides of Eqs.(A9) and (A14) gives the
      following expression for &omega;:

    <p>
      From this we get for the period <i>P</i> (we are using <i>P</i>

      This is Equ.(1) from the first section of this Lesson. (In that

    <p>
      Let's complete this set of derivations by demonstrating that,
      within the magnitude of the approximations made, the tension
      <i>T</i> can be equated to the gravitational force <i>mg</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this purpose, let's look at the free-body diagram for the
      bob once more, but this time taking components in directions
      parallel and perpendicular to the string. The result is shown
      in Figure A6 below.

      The pendulum bob moves on a circular path and therefore has a

      the bob up the string and of magnitude
      <i>v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>L</i> where <i>v</i> is the bob's speed

      For small  &beta;, 10<sup>o</sup> or
      less, <i>cos</i>  &beta; is within 1.5%
      of 1. Check it with your pocket calculator. Thus we make an
      error by the same order of magnitude as before if we simply
      replace <i>cos</i>  &beta; by 1 in
      Equ.(A18). An error of similar magnitude is made if we drop
      the <i>v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>L</i> term in comparison with the
      <i>g</i> term in the square bracket in Equ.(A18). In fact,
      the two errors tend to compensate each other. With these two

      One can estimate the magnitude of
      <i>v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>L</i> as follows. When the pendulum
      bob is as far to the right as it will go, i.e., at <i>x</i> =
      <i>A</i>, its center is elevated by an amount <i>h</i> above
      its bottom position. At this point, the bob has an amount of
      gravitational potential energy equal to <i>mgh</i> relative
      to that at the bottom point. This much potential energy is
      converted into kinetic energy as the bob moves from <i>x</i>
      = <i>A</i> to <i>x</i> = 0, where the bob has its maximum
      kinetic energy. Thus,

      Since (<i>h</i>/<i>L</i>) is very much smaller than 1 for small
      amplitudes, <i>v<sub>max</sub></i><sup>2</sup>/<i>L</i> is very
      much smaller than <i>g</i>,

      Thus, we are justified in approximating the tension <i>T</i>
      simply by <i>mg</i>.

      However, as the considerations in this section show, a small
      mistake <b>is</b> made in identifying the motion of a simple
      pendulum with SHM, even at small amplitudes.
