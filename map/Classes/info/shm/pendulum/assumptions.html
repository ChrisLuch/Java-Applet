<div class="title">Assumptions - Simple Harmonic Motion (Pendulum)</div>

    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates both simple pendulum motion and uniform
      circular motion. At the small amplitudes used in the applet,
      the pendulum's motion is very nearly simple harmonic motion
      and visually indistinguishable from projected uniform
      circular motion.
    </div>


<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p>The simple pendulum motion simulated by the applet is such that the
vertical projection of this motion onto a horizontal axis is exactly
simple harmonic motion.  The true motion of a simple pendulum is not
simple harmonic motion, but for sufficiently small amplitudes, the
motion simulated by the applet is an excellent approximation to the
true motion.

<p>The following additional assumptions are made in creating the simulation.

<p><ul>

   <li>The pendulum string is massless.</li>

   <li>The pendulum bob behaves like a mass point.</li>

   <li>The system is frictionless.</li>

   </ul>
