      Observing the Motion and Energy Changes
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Prepare the applet for observing the
      satellite's motion.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Reset <img src="../images/Reset.gif" alt="Reset" align=
        "top"> the applet. 
        <p>
          The magenta velocity vector should be visible. The tail
          end of this vector is at the satellite. You can hide or
          display the velocity vector by deselecting or selecting
          this vector from the Vector panel. To open the Vector
          panel, select the Vectors button <img src=
          "../images/Vectors.gif" alt="Vectors" align="top">.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the time being, keep the velocity vector displayed and
        also display the gravitational force acting on the
        satellite by selecting the vector from the Vector panel.
        The magnitude of this force is the satellite's weight
        <i>W</i>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Initial Position and Velocity</u>. Enter the values
        <i>v</i> = 8,800 m/s and &theta; = 0
        in the second row of the velocity entry fields, and press
        ENTER. Don't forget to press ENTER, because otherwise the
        applet will not recognize the new values. The velocity
        vector arrow and the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components of
        the velocity data fields will be adjusted accordingly. The
        velocity vector should now be horizontal pointing to the
        right. 
        <p>
          Enter the values <i>x</i> = 0 and <i>y</i> = 10 km in the
          position data entry fields, and press ENTER. The
          satellite will be moved to a point just above the north
          pole (top) of the earth. Drag the Data box out of the way
          if necessary to see the satellite.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        <u>Scale Setting</u>. After Reset, the distance scale is
        set at 100 pix = 1,000 km. Change the scale setting to 100
        pix = 10,000 km by clicking the second radio button to the
        right of the present one. All distances will now be shown
        ten times smaller and the velocity vector arrow somewhat
        smaller as well. In general, the length of the arrow
        representing the velocity (but not the actual velocity
        value) is adjusted as the distance scale is changed, but by
        a smaller factor than the distances or for some scale
        changes not at all. It is not important to know by what
        factor the length of the arrow representing the velocity is
        adjusted.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <u>Trace</u>. Select the trace button <img src=
        "../images/Trace.gif" alt="trace" align="top"> to show the
        satellite's path when the satellite is in motion.
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        <u>Energy Box</u>. Select the Data button <img src=
        "../images/Data.gif" alt="Data" align="top">. This will
        cause the Data box and the Energy box to be displayed. Drag
        the Data box out of the way or close it.
       </p> 
        <p>
          In the Energy box, the blue portion of the "final" energy
          bar, representing the potential energy <i>PE</i>, should
          stop just above the level marked -1.0 <i>mgR</i>. The top
          end of the "final" energy bar, at the end of the red
          portion representing the kinetic energy of the satellite
          (and also the total kinetic energy of the satellite-earth
          system since the earth is assumed to be at rest), should
          be a little bit above the level marked -0.4 <i>mgR</i>.
          Thus, the kinetic energy is equal to a bit more than 0.6
          <i>mgR</i>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Click PLAY <img src="../images/Play.gif"
      alt="Play" align= "top">, and observe the following aspects of
      the satellite's motion:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        speed of the satellite (represented by length of velocity
        vector)
      </li>
      <li>
        kinetic energy of satellite (represented by red portion of
        energy bar labeld "final")
      </li>
      <li>
        force of gravity acting on the satellite
      </li>
      <li>
        potential energy <i>PE</i> of satellite (represented by
        blue portion of energy bar labeled "final")
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Pause <img src="../images/Pause.gif" alt="Pause" align="top">
      the motion after the satellite has completed a bit more than
      one revolution. The orbit should look like that in the
      snapshot in Figure 1 below.

      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The satellite's path is somewhat elliptical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Replay the motion several times, if necessary, and answer the
      following questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. How does the speed vary during the motion?
      Where is it largest, where is it smallest?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. How does the kinetic energy vary during
      the motion? Where is it largest and where is it smallest?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 3</b>. At any moment during the motion, in which
      direction does the force of gravity point?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 4</b>. How does the potential energy vary during
      the motion? Where is it largest and where is it smallest?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 5</b>. How does the mechanical energy of the
      system, i.e., the sum of kinetic and potential energy, vary
      during the motion?

    <div class="sectionheading">
      Locking the Initial Energies
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. REWIND the applet, and don't change any of the
      settings used in the previous section. Observe what happens
      to the energy bar marked "initial" when you press the Initial
      button <img src="../images/Lock.gif" alt="Lock Energies"
      align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "initial" bar should get adjusted so that it represents
      the current potential and kinetic energies, i.e., it should
      become identical in appearance to the "final" bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Now PLAY the motion, and observe both the
      initial and final energy bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "initial" bar should remain unchanged. It shows the
      potential and kinetic energies at the start of the motion.
      However, the final bar will show how the potential and
      kinetic energies change during the motion.

    <p>
      In this section, you will observe different motions at
      different settings of the distance and energy scales.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Change the distance
      scale to the most zoomed-in setting "100 pix = 10 km",
      display the velocity vector, and set the initial position and
      velocity to

    </p>
    <p>
      Press the Data button, and drag the Data box out of the way
      so that only the Energy box remains visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Press the Initial button, select the Trace button, PLAY the
      motion, and PAUSE it. You should see energy bars like those
      in Figure 2 below, no matter where you pause the motion.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="../images/EOProjectile.gif" alt=

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential energy <i>PE</i> is very close to -1.0
      <i>mgR</i>, and the kinetic energy very close to 0 on the
      given energy display scale. Variations in potential and
      kinetic energy during the motion appear minute on this scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Click REWIND, and drag the Zoom slider in
      the Energy box as high up as possible. That will expand the
      energy region around the level -1.0 <i>mgR</i> as much as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion, and PAUSE somewhere near the previous Pause
      point. You should see something like the snapshot in Figure 3
      below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The enlarged energy bar shows that the mechanical energy is
      close to -0.997 <i>mgR</i>. At the previous energy scale,
      this value was too close to -1.0 <i>mgR</i> to be
      distinguishable from -1.0 <i>mgR</i>. At the present energy
      scale, it also can be seen clearly that both the potential
      energy and the kinetic energy are changing during the motion.
      Replay the motion to observe these changes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. Are the changes in potential and kinetic
      energy that you can observe for this projectile motion
      consistent qualitatively with those observed for the earlier
      satellite motion? Does the potential energy increase and the
      kinetic energy decrease as the projectile gains elevation?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. RESET the applet. Set the distance scale
      to the most zoomed-out setting: 100 pix = 100,000 km. Select
      the Data button and drag the Data box off to one side, but
      keep the Energy box in view. Set the initial position and
      velocity to

         &theta; = 0<sup>o</sup> .
    </p>
    <p>
      You should find that the potential energy bar in the "final"
      column extends beyond the top of the window. Drag the Zoom
      slider in the Energy box downward until the energy level 0.0
      <i>mgR</i> and the top of the "final" energy column come into
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top of the "final" energy column should be very near -0.1
      <i>mgR</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Keeping all settings as at the end of
      Exercise 3, press the Initial button, Select the Trace
      button, and PLAY the motion. Observe the changes in potential
      and kinetic energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motion will be slow at first. PAUSE it at some point. You
      might see something like the snapshot in Figure 4 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 4</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment shown in Figure 4, the potential energy has
      decreased and the speed and kinetic energy have increased
      considerably compared with the initial moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click PLAY again, and watch the motion until the satellite
      crashes into the earth. The initial speed of the satellite
      was not large enough to carry the satellite around the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment of the crash, the potential energy should be
      equal to -1.0 <i>mgR</i>, which is its value when the
      satellite is at the surface of the earth.
