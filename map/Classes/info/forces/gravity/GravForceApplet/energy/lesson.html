<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p><b>Prerequisites</b>

<p>Students should be familiar with Newton's second law and Newton's
universal law of gravitation.  They should be familiar with the
concept of potential energy and the expression for gravitational
potential energy near the surface of the earth.

<p><b>Learning Outcomes</b>

<p>Students will develop an understanding of how the gravitational
potential energy of an object in the earth's gravitational field
varies with the object's elevation above the surface of the earth, and
they will learn to apply the law of energy conservation to predict the
speed of an object moving in the earth's gravitational field.

<p><b>Instructions</b>

<p>Students should know how the applet functions, as described in Help and
ShowMe.

<p>The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in the
following text are to be done in the applet. You may need to toggle
back and forth between instructions and applet if your screen space is
limited.

 <p><u>Comment on the force of gravity exerted by the earth on a
 particle at the surface of the earth or above</u>.  Newton's law of
 gravitation describes the gravitational forces that two <b>point</b>
 particles exert on each other.  The earth is not a point particle
 and, therefore, Newton's law of gravitation does not directly give
 the force exerted by the earth on a particle.

 <p>However, as stated under Assumptions in the menu above, the applet
 assumes the earth to be a sphere of uniform mass density.  Under this
 assumption, it can be proved that the gravitational force exerted by
 the earth on a particle at the surface of the earth or above is the
 same as that exerted by a point particle at the center of the earth
 that carries all of the earth's mass <i>M</i>.  Therefore, the
 magnitude <i>W</i> of the force of gravity exerted by the earth on a
 particle of mass <i>m</i> at a distance <i>d</i> from the center of
 the earth is given by

 <p align="center"><i>W</i> =
 <i>GMm</i> / <i>d</i><sup>2</sup> .<img src="../images/small.gif"
 height="1" width="40"> (4)</p>

 <p>The quantity <i>W</i> is called the <i>weight</i> of the particle.
 Note that the weight depends on how far the particle is away from the
 center of the earth, but not on the particle's state of motion.</li>

 <a name="PotEnergy"><li><b>Gravitational Potential Energy of
 Particle-Earth System</b></a>

 <p><u>Particle Near the Surface of the Earth</u>  

 <blockquote>If the particle's elevation <i>h</i> above the surface of
 the earth is much smaller than the earth's radius <i>R</i>, one can
 use the following expression <i>PE'</i> for the potential energy of
 the particle-earth system:

 <p align="center"><i>PE'</i> = <i>mgh</i>, <img
 src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> <i>h</i> <<
 <i>R</i> <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">
 (5)</p>

 <p>where <i>g</i> is the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity
 at the surface of the earth.</blockquote>

 <p><u>Comment 1</u>.  The prime following the symbol <i>PE</i> in the
 potential energy expression (5) is used in this applet to
 distinguish this expression from the following Expression (6).  The
 two expressions differ in two ways: (a) Expression (5) is approximate
 while Expression (6) is exact and (b) the two expressions differ by
 an added constant.  See Comment 3 below.

 <p>Note that an added constant in the potential energy is
 unobservable, because only <b>changes</b> in potential energy are
 observable, and that an added constant will not affect the
 <b>difference</b> between two values of the potential energy.

 <p><U>Particle at Arbitrary Distances from the Surface of the
 Earth</u>

 <blockquote>The gravitational potential energy <i>PE</i> of a
    particle-earth system at arbitrary distances <i>d</i> of the
    particle from the center of the earth is given by

 <p align="center"><i>PE</i> = -<i>GMm</i> / <i>d</i> .<img
 src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (6)</p>

 <p>Expression (6) can also be written in the useful form

 <p align="center"><i>PE</i> = -<i>mgR</i> (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>) <img
 src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (7)</p>

 <p>which is derived in Appendix A.</blockquote>

 <p><u>Comment 2</u>.  <i>PE</i> is negative for all finite values of
 <i>d</i>.  There is nothing strange about negative values of the
 potential energy.  One can always add a negative constant to any
 potential energy and thus make it negative.  Adding a constant to a
 potential energy has no observable consequences.  See Comment 1
 above.

 <p><u>Comment 3</u>.  Expressions (6) and (7) give <i>PE</i> = 0 when
 the particle is infinitely far from the earth while Expression (5)
 gives <i>PE'</i> = 0 when the particle is at the surface of the earth
 (<i>h</i> = 0).  Since Expression (7) gives <i>PE</i> = -<i>mgR</i>
 at the surface of the earth (set <i>d</i> = <i>R</i>),
 <i>PE</i> and <i>PE'</i> are related as follows:

 <p align="center"><i>PE'</i> = <i>PE</i> + <i>mgR</i>, <img
 src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> <i>h</i> <<
 <i>R</i>. <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (8)

 <p>Thus, <i>PE</i> and <i>PE'</i> differ by an additive constant.

 <p><u>Comment 4</u>. The derivation of Expression (6) for <i>PE</i>
 requires calculus since the force of gravity is not constant but
 varies with the particle's distance from the earth.  The derivation
 is given in calculus-based texts and will not be reproduced here.
 Expression (5) can be derived from Expression (6).  This derivation
 is shown in Appendix B.  It is not often found in texts.

 <p><u>Comment 5</u>. Note carefully that in Expressions (6) and (7)
 for the potential energy we have the <b>first</b> power of <i>d</i>
 in the denominator, not the second power as in Expression (4) for the
 weight.  Check that this is consistent dimensionally with the
 definition of work and energy as the product of force and length.
 (However, you can't derive Expression (6) by multiplying the weight
 (4) by the factor
 <i>d</i>!)

 <p><u>Comment 6 (Important)</u>. The potential energy given by
 Expression (6),

  <p align="center"><i>PE</i> = -<i>GMm</i> /
  <i>d</i> ,<img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">
  </p>
            
  <p>is a <b>joint</b> potential energy for the particle-earth
  <b>system</b>.  It is not possible to write this potential energy as
  a sum of a potential energy for the particle and one for the earth.
                                                                                        
  <p>Note that properties of both the earth and the particle enter
  symmetrically into this expression: each object is represented by
  its mass in the same manner, and the distance <i>d</i> between the
  two objects depends on the positions of the two objects in a
  symmetric manner as well.

  <p>Thus, <i>PE</i> is the potential energy of the particle-earth
  <b>system</b>.  Nevertheless, it is customary to refer to this
  potential energy as the "potential energy of the particle", for
  brevity's sake.  You should realize, however, that this is just a
  figure of speech and that the concept of a "potential energy of
  a single particle" is undefined.

  <p>The approximate expression <i>PE'</i> for the potential energy
  near the surface of the earth,

  <p align="center"><i>PE'</i> = <i>mgh</i>, <img
  src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> <i>h</i> <<
  <i>R</i> , <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">
  </p>

 <p>also belongs to the satellite-earth <b>system</b>, not just the
 particle, although Expression (5) does not look symmetric with
 respect to the earth and the particle.  That appearance is only
 superficial, however.  Just insert Expression (A3) from Appendix A
 for <i>g</i> on the right-hand side of Equ.(5) and the right-side
 will also look symmetric with respect to both the earth and the
 particle.</li>

 <p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="../images/top.gif" border ="0"                            
  align="top"></a></p>

<p>

  <a name="EnergyCons"><li><b>Mechanical Energy and Its
  Conservation</b></a>

  <p>Let us consider the mechanical energy <i>E</i> of the two-"particle"
  system consisting of the earth and a satellite (or projectile).  The
  term "particle" can be applied to the earth in the sense of the
  Comment following Equ.(3) under Newton's Law of Universal
  Gravitation above.

  <blockquote>The <i>mechanical energy</i> <i>E</i> of any two-particle
  system is defined as the sum of the potential and kinetic energies
  of the system,

  <p align="center"><i>E</i> = <i>KE</i><sub>1</sub> +
  <i>KE</i><sub>2</sub> + <i>PE</i>. <img src="../images/small.gif"
  height="1" width="40">(9)</blockquote>

  <p><u>Comment 1</u>. There is only one joint potential energy for a
  two-particle system, but two kinetic energies, one for each
  particle.  See Comment 6 under "Gravitational Potential Energy of
  Particle-Earth System" above.
  
  <p>The joint potential energy of the satellite-earth system is given
  by Expression (6), 

  <p align="center"><i>PE</i> = -<i>GMm</i> /
  <i>d</i> .<img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">
  </p>
  
  <p><u>Comment 2</u>. We will take the kinetic energy of the earth to
  be zero because it is totally negligible in the inertial reference
  frame used here, which is the reference frame in which the center of
  mass of the satellite-earth or projectile-earth system is at
  rest. (This center of mass is very close to the center of the sun.)
  If you are not familiar with inertial and center-of-mass frames,
  just think of the earth as at rest and only the satellite or
  projectile as moving.
                                                                                                     
  <p>Thus, we include only the satellite's (or projectile's) kinetic
  energy in the mechanical energy <i>E</i> of the system.  

  <p>In the case of a satellite orbiting the earth at some distance
  that is not negligible to <i>R</i>, we use Expression (6) for the
  potential energy so that the system's mechanical energy is given by

  <p align="center"><i>E</i> = <i>m</i>/2 <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> -
  <i>GMm</i> / <i>d</i> <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
  width="40"> (10)

  <p>where <i>v</i> is the satellite's speed.

  <p>When dealing with a projectile near the earth's surface, we use
  Expression (5) for the potential energy so that the system's
  mechanical energy <i>E'</i> = <i>KE</i> + <i>PE'</i> is given by

  <p align="center"><i>E'</i> = <i>m</i>/2 <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> +
  <i>mgh</i>, <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">
  <i>h</i> << <i>R</i>.<img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
  width="40"> (11)

  <p>Note that <i>E'</i> differs from <i>E</i> by the same constant
  that distinguishes <i>PE'</i> from <i>PE</i>, i.e.,

  <p align="center"><i>E'</i> = <i>E</i> + <i>mgR</i> .<img
  src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">(12)

<p> <a name="PotEnergyDist"><div class="sectionheading">Potential Energy
as Function of Satellite-Earth Distance</div></a>

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet, and set the distance scale
  to 100 pix = 10 km.

  <p>Move the satellite to the north pole by setting <i>x</i> and
  <i>y</i> equal to 0.  Hide the velocity vector, and set the speed to
  0, to make the kinetic energy equal to 0.  Press the Data button,
  and move the Data box to the left or close it so that the satellite
  can be seen.

  <p>Drag the satellite up and down with the mouse, and observe the
  potential energy changes, both by observing the "final" energy bar
  in the Energy box and by observing the values of <i>PE</i> and
  <i>PE'</i> in the Data box.  You will have to move the energy scale
  slider up to be able to observe any changes in the length of the
  potential energy bar.

  <p>You should find that both <i>PE</i> and <i>PE'</i> increase as
  the satellite's elevation increases.  (The <i>PE</i>-values are
  becoming less negative as the elevation increases, which means that
  they are increasing.)

  <p><b>Exercise 2</b>.  Switch the distance scale to 100 pix = 1,000
  km, and continue to drag the satellite away from the earth.  You
  will have to readjust the energy scale slider to bring the top end
  of the "final" energy bar into view.  

  <p>You should be able to observe that as the distance of the
  satellite increases, the potential energy keeps on increasing.

  <p><b>Exercise 3</b>.  Continue in this manner, setting the distance
  scale to more and more zoomed-out positions and moving the satellite
  farther and farther from the earth.  The potential energy should
  keep increasing until eventually <i>PE</i> will approach 0.

  <p><b>Question 1</b>.  Does it make sense for the gravitational
  potential energy to keep on increasing as the satellite's elevation
  increases?

  <p><b>Answer</b>. Yes.  When the satellite is released from rest, it
  will start falling towards the earth and gain kinetic energy.  By
  energy conservation, this gain in kinetic energy is accompanied by a
  loss in potential energy.  Thus, the potential energy must be
  greater at larger distances from the earth.

  <p><b>Question 2</b>.  Do Expressions (5) to (7) for the potential
  energy have the property that the potential energy increases as the
  satellite's distance from the earth increases?

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  The answer is obviously YES for Expression (5).
  To convince yourself that it is YES as well for Expressions (6) and
  (7), you may want to sketch <i>PE</i> as given by these expressions
  as a function of <i>d</i>.  You should obtain a monotonically rising
  curve, as shown in Figure 1 below.

  <a name="EnergyConservation"><div class="sectionheading">Energy
  Conservation</div></a>

  <p>This section will deal with the conservation of mechanical energy
  in the two-body system consisting of the earth and a projectile or
  satellite and some of its applications.

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>.  Read the sections titled "Gravitational Potential
  Energy of Particle-Earth System" and "Mechanical Energy and Its
  Conservation" at the beginning of the Lesson.

  <p><b>Exercise 2</b>.  RESET the applet.  Set the distance scale to
  100 pix = 10 km.  Display the Energy box and drag the Data box out
  of the way.  Set the initial position and velocity to

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"><i>x</i> = 0, <img
  src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"><i>y</i> = 10 km

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"><i>v</i> = 400 m/s,
  <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">&theta; = 30<sup>o</sup>

  <p>PLAY the motion, and display the trace.  Observe changes in the
  potential and kinetic energies as displayed by the Energy bar.  You
  will have to move the energy scale slider all the way to the top to
  be able to observe the changes in these energies.

  <p>Is the mechanical energy conserved during the motion?  Do the
  potential and kinetic energies behave the way you would expect?

  <p><b>Question 1</b>.  For the initial conditions in Exercise 2,
  what is the initial value of the mechanical energy
  <i>E'</i> of the projectile-earth system?

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  The mechanical energy <i>E'</i> has
  the value

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
  width="40"><i>E'<sub>i</sub></i> =
  <i>m</i>/2 <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> +
  <i>mgh</i> 

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="58">= (40/2)&times;400<sup>2</sup> +
  40&times;9.805&times;1&times;10<sup>4</sup>

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="58">=
  3.200&times;10<sup>6</sup> + 3.922&times;10<sup>6</sup>

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="58">=
  7.122&times;10<sup>6</sup> J. <img src="../images/small.gif"
  height="1" width="80">(13)

  <p>Compare these values with those shown in the Data box.  The
  values of <i>KE</i> are exactly the same, but the values for
  <i>PE'</i> and <i>E'</i> calculated here are very close, but not
  exactly the same as those in the Data box.  Why?

  <p>The values in the Data box are better because they take into
  account that the acceleration due to gravity is not a constant equal
  to 9.805 m/s<sup>2</sup>, but decreases as one goes away from the
  earth.  Note that the value of <i>a</i>, the magnitude of the
  projectile's acceleration, is given in the Data box as 9.774
  m/s<sup>2</sup> at <i>y</i> = 10 km.  This is the acceleration due
  to gravity at that elevation, and it is a little bit less than
  <i>g</i>.

  <p>If you want to calculate the projectile's potential energy and
  mechanical energy at <i>y</i> = 10 km exactly, use Expressions (6)
  or (7) for the potential energy.  The results should agree with the
  values given in the Data box.

  <p><b>Question 2</b>. With what speed does the projectile hit the
  ground?

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  The mechanical energy of the projectile-earth
  system is conserved during the projectile's flight.  Therefore, the
  final energy <i>E'<sub>f</sub></i>, just before the projectile hits
  the ground, is equal to the initial energy <i>E'<sub>i</sub></i>
  which has the approximate value (13) above.  Using this value and
  the final elevation <i>h<sub>f</sub></i> = 0 gives the equation

  <p> <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"><i>m</i>/2
  <i>v<sub>f</sub></i><sup>2</sup> + <i>mgh<sub>f</sub></i> =
  (40/2) <i>v<sub>f</sub></i><sup>2</sup> + 0 =
  7.122&times;10<sup>6</sup> J <img src="../images/small.gif"
  height="1" width="40">(14)

  <p>whence

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
  width="80"><i>v<sub>f</sub></i> = <img
  src="../images/root16.gif">(7.122&times;10<sup>6</sup> / 20) =
  5.967&times;10<sup>2</sup> m/s.<img src="../images/small.gif"
  height="1" width="40">(15)

  <p>Compare this value with the value 5.966&times;10<sup>2</sup> m/s
  which can be calculated from the final velocity components given in
  the Data box.  The two values are very close.

  <p><u>Comment</u>.  One can avoid using the mass in these
  calculations by not calculating the energy first.  Just use the
  equation for energy conservation,

  <p align="center">(<i>m</i>/2) <i>v<sub>i</sub></i><sup>2</sup> +
  <i>mgh<sub>i</sub></i> = (<i>m</i>/2)
  <i>v<sub>f</sub></i><sup>2</sup> + <i>mgh<sub>f</sub></i>,<img
  src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">(16)

  <p>and cancel the common factor of <i>m</i> out of all terms.
  Substituting the given values of <i>v<sub>i</sub></i>,
  <i>h<sub>i</sub></i>, and <i>h<sub>f</sub></i>, one can then solve
  for <i>v<sub>f</sub></i>. Do this, and compare your answer with
  value (15) above.

  <p><b>Exercise 3</b>.  RESET the applet.  Set the distance scale
         to the most zoomed-out setting: 100 pix = 100,000 km.  Select the
         Data button and drag the Data box off to one side, but keep the
         Energy box in view.  Set the initial position and velocity to

    <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
    width="40">(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)(0) = (0, 50,000) km ,

    <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"><i>v</i> =
    1,000 m/s, <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">
    &theta; = 0<sup>o</sup> .

         <p>You should find that the potential energy bar in the "final"
         column extends beyond the top of the window.  Drag the Zoom slider
         in the Energy box downward until the energy level 0.0 <i>mgR</i>
         and the top of the "final" energy column come into view.

         <p>The top of the "final" energy column should be very near -0.1
         <i>mgR</i>.

			<p>Press the Lock-Initial-Energy button so that the "initial"
         energy bar is adjusted to look like the "final" energy bar,
         select the Trace button, and PLAY the motion.  Observe the
         changes in potential and kinetic energy.

         <p>The motion will be slow at first.  PAUSE it at some point.  You
         might see something like the snapshot in Figure 2 below.

    <p align="center"><img src="../images/EOSatellite.gif"></p> 

         <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

         <p>At the moment shown in Figure 2, the potential energy has
         decreased and the speed and kinetic energy have increased
         compared with the initial moment.  Is that what you would
         have expected?  Is the mechanical energy conserved?

         <p>Click PLAY again, and watch the motion until the satellite
         crashes into the earth.  The initial speed of the satellite
         is not large enough to carry the satellite around the earth.

         <p>At the moment of the crash, the potential energy should be
         equal to -1.0 <i>mgR</i>, which is its value when the satellite is
         at the surface of the earth.

			<p><b>Question 3</b>.  At the start of the motion, what is
			the value of the energy <i>E</i> of the satellite-earth system?

			<p><b>Answer</b>.  Using Expression (7) for the potential
			energy, the mechanical energy <i>E</i> can be calculated as follows.

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="43"><i>E</i> =
  <i>m</i>/2 <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>mgR</i> (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>) 

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="58">=
  (40/2)&times;1,000<sup>2</sup> -
  40&times;9.805&times;6.378&times;10<sup>6</sup>&times;(6,378/56,378)

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="58">=
  2.000&times;10<sup>7</sup> - 2.830&times;10<sup>8</sup>

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="58">= -
  2.630&times;10<sup>8</sup> J. <img src="../images/small.gif"
  height="1" width="80">(17)

  <p>Compare these values with those shown in the Data box.  They
  should agree.

  <p><b>Question 4</b>.  Given the intial values from Exercise 3, with
  what speed does the satellite crash into the earth?

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  The calculation of the final value
  <i>v<sub>f</sub></i> of the speed is analogous to that in Question
  2.  The only difference is that here the exact potential energy must
  be used instead of Approximation (5).  Approximation (5) is not
  valid here because the elevation of the satellite above the earth is
  not small compared to <i>R</i>.  We will use Expression (7) for the
  potential energy.

  <p>With that, and using value (17) for <i>E</i> and
  <i>d<sub>f</sub></i> = <i>R</i>, the analog of Equ.(14) becomes

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
  width="40"><i>E<sub>f</sub></i> = <i>m</i>/2
  <i>v<sub>f</sub></i><sup>2</sup> - <i>mgR</i> (<i>R</i>/<i>d<sub>f</sub></i>) 

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="55">= (40/2)
  <i>v<sub>f</sub></i><sup>2</sup> - <i>mgR</i> 

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
  width="55">= <i>E<sub>i</sub></i> = -2.630&times;10<sup>8</sup> J <img
  src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">

  <p>whence

  <p align="center">20 <i>v<sub>f</sub></i><sup>2</sup> - <i>mgR</i> =
  -2.630&times;10<sup>8</sup> J. <img src="../images/small.gif"
  height="1" width="40"> (18)

  <p>With the value of <i>mgR</i> inserted into Equ.(18),

  <p align="center"><i>mgR</i> =
  40&times;9.805&times;6.378&times;10<sup>6</sup> =
  2.50145&times;10<sup>9</sup> J,<img src="../images/small.gif"
  height="1" width="40">(19)

  <p>solving the resulting equation for <i>v<sub>f</sub></i> gives

  <p> <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
  width="80"><i>v<sub>f</sub></i> = <img
  src="../images/root16.gif">[(2.50145&times;10<sup>9</sup>

  1.058&times;10<sup>4</sup> m/s.<img src="../images/small.gif"
  height="1" width="40">(20)

  <p>Check that this value is consistent with those of the final
  velocity and the final kinetic energ of the satellite given in the
  Data box.  The values should agree within the number of significant
  digits listed here.

  <p><u>Comment 1</u>.  If the approximate potential energy (5), rather
  than the exact potential energy (7), had been used to calculate
  <i>v<sub>f</sub></i>, a totally incorrect result would have been
  obtained.  You may want to do this calculation.  The reason for the
  incorrect result is, of course, that the condition <i>h</i> <<
  <i>R</i> under which Approximation (5) is good is severely violated
  in the present situation.

  <p><u>Comment 2</u>.  As in Question 2, one can avoid using the mass
  in calculating <i>v<sub>f</sub></i> by not calculating the energy
  first.  Just use the equation for energy conservation,

  <p align="center">(<i>m</i>/2) <i>v<sub>i</sub></i><sup>2</sup> -
  <i>mgR</i> (<i>R</i>/<i>d<sub>i</sub></i>) = (<i>m</i>/2)
  <i>v<sub>f</sub></i><sup>2</sup> - <i>mgR</i>
  (<i>R</i>/<i>d<sub>f</sub></i>),<img src="../images/small.gif"
  height="1" width="40">(21)

  <p>and cancel the common factor of <i>m</i> out of all terms.
  Substituting the given values of <i>v<sub>i</sub></i>,
  <i>d<sub>i</sub></i>, and <i>d<sub>f</sub></i> = <i>R</i>, one can
  then solve for <i>v<sub>f</sub></i>. Do this, and compare your
  answer with result (20) above.

  <p>It turns out that the expression in square brackets is equal to
  <i>g</i>.  This can be shown as follows.                                                    
                                                                                               
  <p>Let us consider a satellite just above the surface of the earth,
  so that <i>d</i> = <i>R</i>.  The acceleration of such a satellite
  has the magnitude <i>g</i>, if the only force acting on the
  satellite is the force of gravity.  In this situation, Newton's
  second law applied to the satellite with Expression (4) for the
  satellite's weight,

  <p align="center"><i>W</i> =
 <i>GMm</i> / <i>d</i><sup>2</sup> ,<img src="../images/small.gif"
 height="1" width="40"></p>

  <p>and <i>g</i> substituted for the magnitude <i>a</i> of the
  satellite's acceleration gives the equation
                                                                                                    
  <p align="center"><i>GMm</i> / <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>m g</i>
  .<img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (A2)
  
  <p>Dividing both sides of this equation by <i>m</i> gives
                                                                                                  
  <p align="center"><i>GM</i> / <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>g</i>. <img
  src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">(A3)
         
  <p>Thus, substituting <i>g</i> for the expression in square brackets
  in Equ.(A1) gives the useful Expression (7) for the potential energy
  <i>PE</i>,

  <p align="center"><i>PE</i> = -<i>mgR</i> (<i>R</i>/<i>d</i>) . <img
  src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="../images/top.gif" border

<p> <a name="AppendixB"><div class="sectionheading">Appendix B:
Approximation to the Potential Energy</div></a>

  <p>In this Appendix we will derive Expression (5) for the potential
  energy near the surface of the earth, i.e., for a satellite
  elevation <i>h</i> that is much smaller than the radius <i>R</i> of
  the earth.  The notation <i>PE</i>(<i>d</i>) will denote the value
  of the potential energy <i>PE</i> when the satellite is at a
  distance <i>d</i> from the center of the earth.

  <p>When a particle is moved from the surface of the earth, at
  <i>d</i> = <i>R</i>, to a point a distance <i>h</i> above the
  surface of the earth, at <i>d</i> = <i>R</i> + <i>h</i>, the
  potential energy <i>PE</i> changes by

  <p align="center"><i>PE</i>(<i>R</i>+<i>h</i>) -
  <i>PE</i>(<i>R</i>). <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
  width="40">(A4)</p>

  <p>Using form (7) for <i>PE</i>, this change can be written

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
  width="20"><i>PE</i>(<i>R</i>+<i>h</i>) -
  <i>PE</i>(<i>R</i>) = -<i>mgR</i> [<i>R</i>/(<i>R</i>+<i>h</i> -
  <i>R</i>/<i>R</i>] 

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="145">=
  -<i>mgR</i> [1/(1+<i>h</i>/<i>R</i>) - 1]. <img
  src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">(A5)

  <p>For <i>h</i> << <i>R</i>, which is equivalent to
  <i>h</i>/<i>R</i> << 1, the first term in the square brackets can be
  approximated to a very good degree if we use the general
  approximation

  <p align="center">1/(1+<i>x</i>) = 1 - <i>x</i>, <img
  src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> if |<i>x</i>| <<
  1. <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">(A6)

  <p>Use a calculator to check how good the approximation is by using,
  say, x = 0.01 and evaluating the left and right hand sides of
  Approximation (A6).

  <p>Approximation (A6) written down for <i>x</i> = <i>h</i>/<i>R</i>
  amounts to

  <p align="center">1/(1+<i>h</i>/<i>R</i>) = 1 - <i>h</i>/<i>R</i>,
  <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40"> if
  <i>h</i>/<i>R</i> << 1. <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
  width="40">(A7)

  <p>Substituting Approximation (A7) into Equ.(A5) simplifies the latter to

  <p><img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
  width="20"><i>PE</i>(<i>R</i>+<i>h</i>) -
  <i>PE</i>(<i>R</i>) = -<i>mgR</i> [1 - <i>h</i>/<i>R</i> - 1] 

  <p><img                                               
  src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="145">=
  <i>mgR</i> [<i>h</i>/<i>R</i>] = <i>mgh</i>. <img
  src="../images/small.gif" height="1" width="40">(A8)

  <p>Thus,

  <p align="center"><i>PE</i>(<i>R</i>+<i>h</i>) = <i>mgh</i> +
  <i>PE</i>(<i>R</i>), <img src="../images/small.gif" height="1"
  width="40"> if <i>h</i> << <i>R</i>. <img src="../images/small.gif"
  height="1" width="40">(A9)</p>

  <p>The first term on the right-hand side in Approximation (A9) is
  Expression (5) for the potential energy
  <i>PE'</i>.  The second term on the right-hand side,
  <i>PE</i>(<i>R</i>) is a constant equal to -<i>mgR</i>.  This establishes Equ.(8).

  <p>Of course, it is much easier to derive Expression (5) for the
  potential energy by using the definition of potential energy in
  terms of work done by the force of gravity and taking that force to
  have the constant magnitude <i>mg</i>, near the surface of the
  earth.  The demonstration given here has the merit that it explains
  how the two very different looking expressions for the potential
  energy, Expressions (5) and (6) or (7), are related.
