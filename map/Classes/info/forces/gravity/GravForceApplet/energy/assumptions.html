<div class="title">Assumptions - Energy and Orbits</div>

<p><div class="sectionheading">The applet simulates the gravitational
 potential energy of a satellite-earth system or projectile-earth
 system along with the satellite's or projectile's kinetic energy and
 the total mechanical energy of the system.</div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">



    <p>The applet makes the following assumptions:

	 <p><ul>

	 <li>The earth is a perfect sphere with radius <i>R</i> =
	 6.378&times;10<sup>3</sup> km.</li>

	 <li>The mass density is uniform throughout the earth.</li>

	 <li>The acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the earth
	 has the magnitude <i>g</i> = 9.805 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</li>

	 <li>The projectile or satellite is subject only to the earth's
	 gravitational force, not to air resistance or any other kind of
	 force.</li>

	 <li>The earth is not rotating about its axis.  

	 <p>Put differently, the applet simulates the motion of a satellite
	 or projectile relative to a coordinate system that is held fixed
	 relative to the fixed stars (inertial frame of reference), and the
	 rotation of the earth relative to this system is not
	 simulated.</li>

	 </ul>

	 <p>A consequence of the first two assumptions is that the force of
	 gravity exerted by the earth on an object above the surface of
	 the earth is the same as that exerted by a point particle whose
	 mass is equal to that of the earth and which is located at the
	 center of the earth.

	 <p>The last assumption implies that the motion of a projectile
	 relative to an earth-fixed coordinate system (rotating
	 non-inertial reference frame) is simulated without the Coriolis
	 and centrifugal forces.  These fictitious forces would affect the
	 motion of a projectile relative to an earth-fixed set of axes in
	 the realistic case in which the earth is rotating.
