      The applet simulates the motion of two blocks connected by a
      string that is guided over a pulley.

        The system has no dissipative friction. There <b>is</b>
        friction between the string and the pulley so that the
        movement of the string causes the pulley to rotate as the
        blocks move. However, this friction is not dissipative
        because there is no slippage of the string relative to the
        pulley.
      <p>
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        The string is inextensible and massless, and both blocks
        move in unison.

        Magnitude of acceleration due to gravity = <i>g</i> = 9.8
        m/s<sup>2</sup>.
      <p>
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        The pulley's moment of inertia <i>I</i> is set by means of
        a slider. However, the slider indicates only the pulley's
        mass. In relating the pulley's mass to the pulley's moment
        of inertia, it is assumed that the pulley is a disk of
        uniform mass density, so that <i>I</i> =
        0.5<i>MR<sup>2</sup></i>. The value of the pulley's moment
        of inertia is displayed in the Data box. 
        <p>
          The radius <i>R</i> of the pulley has a fixed value of 0.500
          m. This is quite a large radius. However, if the radius were
          much smaller, the inertial effects of the pulley would be
          very slight, as long as we take the pulley mass to be of the
          same order of magnitude as the masses of the blocks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        The potential energy of Block 2 is defined so that it is 0
        when the lower edge of the block is at <i>h</i> = 0. The zero
        of the potential energy is indicated by the short horizontal
        line through the potential energy bar. When Block 2 (its lower
        edge) is at <i>h</i> = 0, the top of the blue potential energy
        bar is at <i>h</i> = 0 as well.  This level is also the zero
        of the total mechanical energy.
        <p>
          You should imagine the potential energy bar to reach up from
          negative infinity to its visible height, i.e., to extend
          below the bottom of the applet window. When the top of the
          potential energy bar is below its zero level at <i>h</i> =
          0, the potential energy is negative.  Potential energies can
          be negative, as can the total mechanical energy. Kinetic
          energies, of course, are never negative, by definition.
        </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note</b>. The energies displayed by the applet belong to a
        system consisting of the two blocks, the pulley, the string,
        and the earth. <i>PE<sub>2</sub></i> is the potential energy
        of the pair consisting of Block 2 and the earth. For brevity,
        it is customary to refer to this potential energy as the
        "potential energy of Block 2."
