      The lower edge of Block 2 will be at elevation <i>h</i> =
      1.30 m, and the upper edge of the yellow platform at <i>h</i>
      = 0, as in Figure 1 below.

      <i>m<sub>1</sub></i>, is fixed at 600 g. The pulley's mass,
      <i>M</i>, will be 0, as indicated by the second slider. These

      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Click on Block 1, and drag it until Block
      2 is at elevation <i>h</i> = 3.00 m. Figure 2 below shows
      what you should see. Note the free-body diagram button is

      If your window size is small, you may have to drag Block 1
      beyond the left edge of the window. As long as you don't
      release the mouse button while doing this, you can keep on
      dragging the block. Alternatively, you can resize the window
      by dragging its lower right-hand corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. PLAY the motion, and allow it to continue
      until Block 2 hits the platform at <i>h</i> = 0. Figure 3
      below shows what you should see when the block reaches
      <i>h</i> = 0.

      <b>Figure 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you look carefully, you will notice a small amount of
      white space (1 pixel high) between the bottom of Block 2 and
      the top of the platform. The motion of Block 2 was paused
      before the block could hit the platform! Actually, at the
      instant shown in Figure 3, the bottom of Block 2 is at
      <i>h</i> = 0 and the platform is one pixel below this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform is at <i>h</i> = 0 before the motion begins.
      However, as soon as you click Play, the platform is
      automatically moved downward by one pixel. The motion of the
      blocks is paused automatically when Block 2 reaches the
      original platform position at <i>h</i> = 0. That way the
      applet simulates the conditions in the system when Block 2 is
      at <i>h</i> = 0 just <b>before</b> the block makes contact
      with the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Compare the free-body diagrams in Figures
      2 and 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that the tensions in Figure 3 are smaller than in
      Figure 2. The tensions in Figure 3 apply to an instant when
      the system is in motion, just before making contact with the
      platform, while the tensions in Figure 2 apply to an instant
      when the system is at held at rest by applying a force of
      magnitude <i>F</i> to Block 1, shown in green in the
      free-body diagram for Block 1 in Figure 2. This force is
      absent in Figure 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>. Rewind <img src="Rewind.gif" alt="Rewind"
      align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet will be reset to the configuration shown in Figure
      2 with Block 2 at <i>h</i> = 3.00 m. In the following
      sections, it will be assumed that the motion has been started
      at <i>h</i> = 3.00 m so that the Rewind button returns the
      system to the configuration shown in Figure 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag Block 1 to the right, and observe the two free-body
      diagrams. Observe that some forces are represented by dimmed
      arrows and that there are question marks behind the symbols
      for the magnitudes of these forces. This is intended to
      indicate that the applet cannot know the magnitudes of these
      forces while Block 1 is being dragged. Both <i>F</i> and the
      two tensions depend on the manner in which Block 1 is being
      dragged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 6</b>. REWIND the applet and PLAY the motion
      again, but this time PAUSE it button before Block 2 reaches
      the platform. The free-body diagrams should be as in Figure
      3.
    </p>
    <p>
      REWIND the applet and click the Step button <img src=
      "Step.gif" alt="Step" align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animation is advanced through a discrete time interval.  You
      can click Step repeatedly and observe how the position, speed,
      and energies of the system change in equal time intervals.  The
      values of these quantities are shown in the Data box.  To

      Figure 4 below.
    </p>
    <p>
      If necessary, press the free-body diagram button to display
      the free-body diagrams. You can move the free-body diagrams
      to a different location by clicking on the center of a
      diagram and dragging.

      <b>Figure 4</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet displays the message "Blocks held at rest". You
      can imagine that Block 1 is held fixed by an appropriate
      force of magnitude <i>F</i> directed to the left. This force
      is represented by the green arrow in the free-body diagram
      for Block 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Observe that the free-body diagrams for
      the two blocks contain the forces of magnitudes
      <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> exerted by the
      string on Blocks 1 and 2, respectively. These forces are
      represented by black arrows in the free-body diagrams.  The
      quantities <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> are the
      tensions in the ends of string attached to Blocks 1 and 2,
      respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe from the free-body diagrams that <b>when the blocks
      are held at rest</b>, the following equalities hold:
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>F</i> = <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> =
      <i>W<sub>2</sub></i>, &nbsp;&nbsp; when blocks at rest,
    </p>
    <p>
      where <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> is the weight of Block 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Data box. The values for <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and
      <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> displayed in the Data box should be:
      <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> = 3.9 N.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can check that these values are equal to
      <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> = <i>m<sub>2</sub>g</i> = 0.400x9.8.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. REWIND the applet. The applet will be
      reset to the configuration with Block 2 at elevation <i>h</i>
      = 3.00 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Release the blocks by clicking PLAY, and PAUSE the motion
      before Block 2 reaches the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the free-body diagrams for the two blocks. Depending
      on where you pause the motion, the system's configuration
      will look different. An example is shown in Figure 5 below.
    </p>

    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 5</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that the free-body diagrams contain no applied force of
      magnitude <i>F</i> acting on Block 1, that <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>
      = <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> still, but that <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> &lt;
      <i>W<sub>2</sub></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Data box and verify that now <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>
      = <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> = 2.4 N, which is less than the value
      we had in Exercise 2 when the system was held at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. REWIND the applet, drag Block 1, and
      observe the free-body diagrams. You should see the force of
      magnitude <i>F</i> and the forces applied by the string to
      the blocks represented by dimmed arrows with labels that have
      a question mark behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is to indicate that, while Block 1 is being dragged, the
      applet does not "know" with what acceleration the blocks are
      being dragged. As a result, the dragging force applied to
      Block 1 and the magnitudes of the forces applied by the
      string to the two blocks are not known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Data box, and observe the values for the tensions
      while dragging Block 1. You should find question marks.
      Similarly for the magnitude of the acceleration, the speed,
      and the kinetic energies of the two blocks.

      REWIND the applet, and make sure that Block 2 is at <i>h</i>
      = 3.00 m. Otherwise, RESET the applet and drag Block 1 so
      that Block 2 is at <i>h</i> = 3.00 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion, and observe that the red speedometer needle
      is moving to the right at a constant rate during the motion.
      (Figure 6 below shows the needle still at <i>v</i> = 0.)
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 6</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This uniform increase of the speed implies that the
      acceleration of the blocks is constant. The Data box displays
      the magnitude of the acceleration as 3.92 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. REWIND the applet, and PLAY the motion
      until Block 2 reaches the platform at <i>h</i> = 0. Display
      the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Data box should show that Block 2 reaches the platform at
      <i>t</i> = 1.24 s with a speed <i>v</i> of 4.8 m/s. This
      gives for the magnitude of the acceleration: <i>a</i> =
      4.8/1.24 = 3.87 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Compare this to the value
      <i>a</i> = 3.92 m/s<sup>2</sup> shown in the Data box. Why is
      there a discrepancy of 0.05 m/s<sup>2</sup>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Our calculation of <i>a</i> is to one more significant figure
      than the value of <i>v</i> warrants. When rounding 3.87
      m/s<sup>2</sup> to two significant figures, one obtains 3.9
      m/s<sup>2</sup>, which agrees with the applet's value of 3.92
      m/s<sup>2</sup> within two significant figures.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. REWIND the applet, and make sure that
      Block 2 is at <i>h</i> = 3.00 m. Otherwise, RESET the applet
      and drag Block 1 so that Block 2 is at <i>h</i> = 3.00 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the Pulley Mass slider, shown on the right in Figure 7
      below, to set the pulley's mass to <i>M</i> = 1.00 kg.
      Display the Data box and check that the pulley's moment of
      inertia, <i>I</i>, is equal to 0.125 kg m<sup>2</sup>.

      <b>Figure 7</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet assumes the pulley is a disk of uniform mass density
      and calculates the moment of inertia of the pulley from the mass
      <i>M</i> and the radius <i>R</i> by the equation: <i>I</i> =
      0.5<i>MR<sup>2</sup></i>. <i>R</i> is fixed in the applet at
      0.500 m.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the blocks are still held at rest, observe the tensions in
      the string on both sides of the pulley. The tensions are the
      same as when the pulley's mass is zero,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> =
      <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> = 3.9 N.
    </p>
    <ul class="noindent"></ul>
    <p>
      Now click PLAY, and then click Pause while the motion is in
      progress. Display the Data box, and observe the tensions in the
      two ends of the string and the acceleration of the blocks:
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> = 1.6 N,
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> = 2.9 N, &nbsp;&nbsp;
      <i>a</i> = 2.61 m/s<sup>2</sup> .
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the pulley has mass, the tensions are different on
      different sides of the pulley and both are different from
      what they are in the massless pulley case. Also, the
      magnitude of the acceleration of the blocks is less when the
      pulley has mass than when it does not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the radius (0.500 m) of the pulley has an
      unrealistically large value given the masses of the blocks and
      of the pulley. This exaggeration is necessary to make the
      influence of a non-zero pulley mass noticeable.

      The forces acting on the blocks are shown dimmed and the
      force symbols have question marks behind them. In addition,
      there is a normal force <i>N<sub>2</sub></i> shown acting on
      Block 2. The dimming and the question marks are supposed to
      indicate that one cannot be certain about the magnitudes of
      these forces under the given circumstances, because they
      depend on the magnitude <i>F</i> of the force that is being
      applied to Block 1.

    <p>
      Display the Data box and observe that the values of the tensions
      are displayed with question marks while Block 2 is resting on
      the platform.

    <p>
      The same is true while the blocks are being dragged upward.  In
      this case, also the speed and the magnitude of the acceleration
      have question marks behind them. Drag Block 1 and observe.

      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Drag Block 1 and observe changes in the blue
      energy bar on the right.  Its length, measured from the <i>h</i>
      = 0 level, represents the potential energy <i>PE<sub>2</sub></i>
      of the pair consisting of Block 2 and the earth (the "potential
      energy of Block 2" for short). The length of the bar increases
      as Block 2 moves upward and decreases as Block 2 moves downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag the platform below <i>h</i> = 0, and then drag Block 1
      until the lower edge of Block 2 is below <i>h</i> = 0.  The
      potential energy bar should have its top below the <i>h</i>
      level, indicating that the potential energy is negative in this
      configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The length of the energy bar, measured from the <i>h</i> = 0
      level, also represents the total mechanical energy of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click Play and observe the energy bar during the motion. Its
      total length, representing the total mechanical energy of the
      system, is constant during the motion and equal to the initial
      potential energy when the system is still at rest. The
      individual components of the energy bar, representing the
      kinetic energies of the two blocks and the pulley and the
      potential energy of Block 2, vary in size during the motion.
    </p>
