      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src= "Reset.gif" alt="Reset"
      align="top"> the applet.  Drag both the block and the
      velocitometer to the left to make room for the data box.
      Display the latter by pressing the Data button <img
      src="Data.gif" alt="Data Button" align="top">, and drag it so
      that the following elements are non-overlapping: block, data
      box, acceleration vector, free-body diagram.  See Figure 1 below
      for an illustration.
    </p>

      <b>Figure 1</b>
	 </p>
    <p>
      If you did not change any slider settings, the forces are such
      that the block's acceleration is not zero, as indicated by the
      orange acceleration vector and the non-zero value of
      <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> in the data box..
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet's motion is frozen.  Click PLAY to see the motion,
      then PAUSE to freeze it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. REWIND <img src="Rewind.gif" alt="Rewind"
      align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Increase the static coefficient of friction &mu;<sub>s</sub> from 0.10 to 0.30.
		In doing so, observe that the acceleration becomes zero at some
      intermediate value of &mu;<sub>s</sub>
      and that the magnitude of the friction force increases to a
      maximum value of 10.00 N in the process.  (The data box shows
      that <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i> decreases to a minimum value of
      -10.00 N.)  At what value of &mu;<sub>s</sub> does the acceleration become
      zero and <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i> become equal to -10.00 N?
    </p>
	 <p>
      Verify that this happens at &mu;<sub>s</sub> = 0.21.
    </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Observe that when you are increasing &mu;<sub>s</sub>
		the PLAY button becomes
      inactive as soon as the acceleration becomes 0.  The applet is
      designed so that the PLAY button is active only if pressing it
      would result in a motion of the block.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      With &mu;<sub>s</sub> = 0.30 and the
      acceleration equal to zero, set the initial velocity to some
      non-zero value.  (If the Initial Velocity slider is inactive,
      press REWIND.)  Observe that the PLAY button becomes active as
      soon as the initial velocity is non-zero even though the
      acceleration remains equal to zero.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. With &mu;<sub>s</sub>
      = 0.30 and both the initial velocity and acceleration equal to
      0, increase the magnitude of the applied force past 10 N while
      keeping the force horizontal at all times.  Since the block is
      not moving, the force of friction is called <i>static
      friction</i> in this case.
    </p>
	 <p>
		Observe that the static friction force increases in magnitude
      with the applied force: the red arrow in the free-body diagram
      becomes longer and the value of <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i> in the
      data box becomes more negative.  Thus, the static force of
      friction can take on a range of values.
    </p>
	 <p>
      Observe that  <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i> +
      <i>F<sub>appl,x</sub></i> = 0 as long as the acceleration is
      zero, i.e., as long as we are dealing with a static situation.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>.  With &mu;<sub>s</sub> = 0.30 and both the initial
      velocity and acceleration equal to 0, increase the magnitude of
      the applied force until the acceleration of the block becomes
      non-zero.  What is the magnitude of the applied force at this
      point, assuming the applied force is horizontal?
    </p>
	 <p>
      Verify that the acceleration becomes non-zero when the magnitude
      of the applied force reaches 14.8 N.
	 </p>
    <p>
      Observe that at this point the magnitude of the friction force
      suddenly decreases.  To what value does it decrease?  Now we are
      dealing with <i>kinetic friction</i> since the block is moving.
      (If you don't click PLAY, the block's motion is frozen.)
    </p>
	 <p>
      Increase the magnitude of the applied force to 16 N, and PLAY
      the motion.  What is the magnitude of the friction force now?
      PAUSE the motion, and change the magnitude of the applied force
      to 20 N. What is the magnitude of the friction force now?  You
      should find that the magnitude of the kinetic friction force has
      the constant value of 11.76 N independent of the block's
      velocity or acceleration. 
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 6</b>.  REWIND the applet.  Make sure the settings
      are still as follows.
	 </p>
	 <ul>
      <li>
        Applied Force, Magnitude: 20.0 N
		</li>
		<li>
        Applied Force, Direction: 0.0<sup>o</sup>
		</li>
		<li>
        Coefficient of Friction, static: 0.30
		</li>
		<li>
        Coefficient of Friction, kinetic: 0.24
		</li>
    </ul>
	 <p>
      The applet initially sets the kinetic coefficient of friction to
      80% of the static coefficient of friction.  Therefore, if the
      static coefficient of friction is set to 0.30, the applet sets
      the kinetic coefficient of friction to 0.24.  The applet does
      not allow values of the kinetic coefficient of friction greater
      than 90% and less than 50% of the static coefficient.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      Change the value of the kinetic coefficient of friction from
      0.24 to 0.20 by 0.01 at a time.  The easiest way to do this is
      by clicking on the slider to the left of the slider tab.  Each
      time you click, the tab moves down one notch, i.e., by 0.01.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      Observe that the magnitude of the acceleration increases and the
      magnitude of the (kinetic) friction force decreases as the
      kinetic coefficient of friction decreases.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      Increase the kinetic coefficient of friction in steps of 0.01,
      by clicking on the slider to the right of the slider tab, and
      observe the acceleration and friction force vectors.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      Now vary the value of the <b>static</b> coefficient of friction.
      Observe that the kinetic coefficent of friction gets adjusted
      automatically, such the ratio of the two coefficients stays
      constant.  Again, observe the changes in the acceleration and
      friction force vectors.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet.  Press the Data button <img

      Data box. Move the data box and/or the free-body diagram so that
      the two do not overlap.
    </p>
	 <p>
      Set the static coefficient of friction to 0.30.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      Drag the tip of the black applied force vector that is attached
      to the block.  Vary the vector in both magnitude and direction,
      and observe the corresponding changes in the free-body diagram.
      In general, as the applied force is varied, both the normal
      force and the friction force change.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Hold down the SHIFT key while you are
      dragging the tip of the black applied force vector attached to
      the block.  Now the force vector is forced to remain horizontal.
      Again observe the changes in the free-body diagram as you change
      the applied force.

      The Block's Motion
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. REWIND the applet, and set the static
      coefficient of friction to 0.30.  Change no other settings.  The
      block's acceleration should be zero, as indicated in the middle
      of the applet window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Increase the magnitude of the applied force to 16 N while
      keeping the force horizontal.  The acceleration should now be
      non-zero.  Observe that the magnitude of the applied force in
      the free-body diagram is larger than that of the friction force.
    </p>
	 <p>
	   PLAY the motion. Observe the red velocitometer needle.  It shows
	   that the block's velocity is increasing.  Observe that the
	   motion of the red needle of the velocitometer is uniform.  This
	   indicates that the block's acceleration is constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      PAUSE the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. REWIND the applet. Set the initial velocity
      to 1.0 m/s.  Observe that this change has no effect on the size
      of the acceleration vector or on the size of the friction force
      in the free-body diagram.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion.  Observe that the block's initial motion is
      faster than before but that the rate at which the velocitometer
      needle is moving to the right appears to be the same as before,
      because the acceleration is unchanged.  PAUSE the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. REWIND the applet.  Set the initial velocity
      to -2.0 m/s.  Observe that as soon as the Initial Velocity
      slider takes on a negative value, the magnitude of the block's
      acceleration jumps and the force of friction in the free-body
      diagram changes direction.  For negative values of the initial
      velocity, the force of friction points to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion.  Observe that at first the block moves left
      while slowing down, momentarily comes to a stop, and then
      resumes moving, but this time to the right and with increasing
      speed.  The velocitometer needle is moving to the right at all
      times, but at different rates before and after the block comes
      to a stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the change in the magnitude of the ball's acceleration
      vector and the change in the direction of the friction force as
      the ball's motion reverses direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. REWIND the applet.  Change the magnitude of
      the applied force to 10.0 N.  Observe that the magnitude of the
      friction force is now slightly less than that of the applied
      force.
    </p>
	 <p>
      PLAY the motion.  Observe that this time the block comes to a
      stop and remains at a standstill.  At the moment the block's
      motion stops, the force of friction reverses direction.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 5</b>.  REWIND the applet. Set the sliders as follows. 
	 </p>
	 <ul>
      <li>
        Initial Velocity: 0.0 m/s
		</li>
		<li>

      Hide the free-body diagram by clicking the FBD toggle button
      <img src="FBD.gif" alt="FBD Button" align="top">, and display
      the data box by pressing the Data button <img src="Data.gif"

	 <p>
      PLAY the motion, and observe the changes of <i>t</i>, <i>x</i>,
      and <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> in the data box.  PAUSE the motion.
      Then STEP the motion forward 0.01 s per step.  This allows you
      to reach a precise value of the time <i>t</i> at which you want
      to pause the motion, e.g., at <i>t</i> = 1.23 s.  Try it. Record
      the value of <i>x</i> at this time.  (For comparison with that
      observed in the next Exercise.)

	 <p>
      <b>Exercise 6</b>. REWIND the applet.  Drag the <i>x</i>-axis so
      that the block's position (front edge of block) is at 1.00 m.
      PLAY the motion, and again PAUSE it at <i>t</i> = 1.23 m.  What

      Note that the data box gives the initial value of the kinetic

      <i>KE</i>(0) in the kinetic energy since the beginning of the
