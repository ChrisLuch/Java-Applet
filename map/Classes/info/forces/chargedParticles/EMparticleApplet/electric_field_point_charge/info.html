      Help - Potential Energy and Potential In A Non-Uniform
      Electric Field
    </div>
    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates the motion of a charged particle in a
      non-uniform electric field, displays the particle's potential
      and kinetic energies, and displays the electric potential at
      the particle's location and at other selected locations.

        <p>
          To set the particle's initial position, click on the
          particle and drag. To make it easier to achieve a certain
          set of initial (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) values, hold down the
          SHIFT key while dragging the particle. This will allow
          dragging in either the horizontal or vertical directions
          only, thus making it easier to set one of the two
          coordinates at a time.  The particle's position coordinates
          can be read in the Data box.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the particle is at the position you want, click the
          Initial button <img src= "../elpotimages/Initial.gif"
          alt="Set Initial Position and Energy" align="top">. This
          will accomplish four things.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It will make the applet remember this position. If you
            click REWIND after PLAYing the motion, the particle will be returned
                to this position.
          </li>
	  <li>
            It will make the applet remember the particle's initial velocity. If you
            click REWIND after PLAYing the motion, the particle will be returned
                to its initial position with its initial velocity.
          </li>  
          <li>
            It will cause the particle's displacement vector to be
            taken from this initial point.
          </li>
          <li>
            It will set the potential and kinetic energies in the
            energy bar that is labeled "initial" to the values at
            this initial position. The energy values displayed by
            the "initial" bar will not change during the subsequent
            motion. More about the energy bars in Point 11 below.

          When the Coordinates button is selected, clicking at some
          location in the applet window will mark that location with a
          "+" and display the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> coordinates of the
          location. This way you can measure the coordinates of a field
          point. The electric potential in volt (V) at that point will
          be displayed also.
        </p>
        <p>
          The field point can be dragged to a new location as
          long as the mouse button is depressed. If the SHIFT key is
          held down while dragging, the field point will move only in the
          horizontal or vertical directions. As many field points as are
          needed can be marked in this manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          One can return the mouse pointer to an existing location
          marker at a later time and drag the marker then.
        </p>
        <p>
          Double-clicking on a field point marker will remove it, but
          only if the Coordinates button is selected at the time. One
          can remove a marker at any time, even if the Coordinates
          button had been deselected after placing the marker, as long
          as this button is selected when one double-clicks on the
          marker.

        <p>
          When a field point marker has been set at some point as
          explained in the preceding Point 7, the electric field
          line (in green) and equipotential line (in mustard color)
          through that point can be displayed by clicking the
          Field-Line or Equipotential-Line button, respectively.
          The equipotential "lines" are actually circles in this
          case, the source charge being at the center of the
          circles.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a line is displayed, its button becomes inactive. It
          becomes active again when another field point marker is
          set.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dragging the field point marker will cause the field line
          and equipotential line through that point to be dragged
          along.

        <p>
          Two data fields are available to specify the initial
          velocity vector. Enter values in the two fields and press
          ENTER on the keyboard to set the initial velocity. The
          magenta velocity vector will be adjusted accordingly.
          Alternatively, you can drag the tip of the velocity
          vector. The values in the two velocity data fields will
          be adjusted accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the motion, the values in the velocity data fields
          and the magenta arrow, if displayed, will represent the
          instantaneous velocity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Four different modes are available for specifying the
          velocity vector numerically. Choose between them by
          clicking the button <img src=
          "../elpotimages/posangle.gif" alt="" align="top"> to the
          left of the velocity data entry fields. The button will
          let you cycle through the four possibilities:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <u>Polar (positive)</u> <img src=
            "../elpotimages/posangle.gif" alt="" align="top"> 
            <p>
              The vector is specified by its polar coordinates:
              magnitude and direction angle. The direction angle is
              taken between the vector and the 'East' direction
              (positive <i>x</i> direction). All angles are
              positive between 0 and 360<sup>0</sup>, increasing in
              the counter-clockwise sense starting with the East
              direction.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Polar (pos &amp; neg)</u> <img src=
            "../elpotimages/posnegangle.gif" alt="" align="top"> 
            <p>
              The mode is like the Polar (positive) mode, except
              that the angles are taken to be in the range from
              -180<sup>0</sup> to 180<sup>0</sup>. The angle is
              negative if a vector points to a point below the
              horizontal axis, and it is positive otherwise.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Navigational</u> <img src="../elpotimages/nav.gif"
            alt="" align="top"> 
            <p>
              The mode is like the Polar (positive) mode, except
              that angles are taken relative to one of the four
              compass directions, either in the clockwise or
              counter-clockwise sense. This allows for eight
              different ways of specifying the angle, from east of
              north (E of N), to north of east (N of E), to west of
              north (W of N). The choice can be made from a
              drop-down menu that becomes available in the
              Navigational mode. All angles range from 0 to
              360<sup>0</sup>.

              The vector is specified by its <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>

        <p>
          There are three sliders, for adjusting the charge of the
          source and the charge and mass of the test particle.  The
          source and test charges can be varied from -3 mC to 3 mC in
          steps of 1 mC. The test mass can be varied from 1.0 kg to
          3.0 kg in steps of 0.1 kg.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clicking on a slider to the left or right of the slider tab
          allows fine adjustment of the slider setting.

          Clicking on the Input Dialog button <img src=

          "top"> of a slider will open a dialog for entering an
          exact value for the slider setting. The dialog for the
          Charge-slider is illustrated below. The range in which
          values can be entered, from -3 C to 3 C in this
          case, is indicated above the data entry field.

        <p>
          When the Data button is selected, two draggable boxes are
          displayed: the Data box (see Point 6 above) and the Energy
          box, shown in the preceding image.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Energy box contains three columns, which display from
          left to right:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the electric potential <i>V</i> at the current particle
            position,
          </li>
          <li>
            the current kinetic energy <i>KE</i> and current
            electric potential energy <i>PE</i> of the particle,
          </li>
          <li>
            the initial kinetic and electric potential energies of
            the particle.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The "initial" moment to which the kinetic and potential
          energies correspond is the moment when the Initial button
          <img src= "../elpotimages/Initial.gif" alt="Initial Position
          and Energy" align="top"> is clicked.  If this button is not
          clicked, then the default energies upon resetting the applet
          are taken as the initial energies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The horizontal black line across the middle of the energy
          bars indicates the level of zero potential energy and zero
          electric potential.  The potential energy and the electric
          potential are taken to be zero when the particle or the
          field point, respectively, are at an infinite distance from
          the source.

        <p>
          The Energy box contains a vertical slider in its upper
          left region. See the image in the preceding Point 12. The
          short cross bar can be dragged up or down to increase or
          decrease, respectively, the height of the energy and
          potential bars measured from the zero level.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scale factor that determines the size of the bars is
          applied to the potential energy and the electric
          potential relative to their zero level, i.e., such that
          the level indicated by the line crossing all three bars
          remains in the same position.
