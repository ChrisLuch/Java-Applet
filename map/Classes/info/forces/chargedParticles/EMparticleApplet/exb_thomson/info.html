      The applet simulates the deflection of a charged particle
      upon passing through perpendicular electric and magnetic
      fields and allows determination of the charge/mass ratio by
      varying the fields and observing the corresponding
      deflections.

        <p>
          There are four basic control buttons. One of these, the
          Play/Pause button, is a dual button. The buttons are,
          from left to right:

            the simulation to the starting point with the
            previously chosen initial values and system parameters.
            Rewind makes it easy to compare motions that differ in
            the setting of just one parameter. After clicking
            Rewind, click Play to restart the motion or Step to go
            through the motion one step at a time.

           <p>
            <img src="Play.gif" alt="Play" align="top"> Clicking
            the Play button starts the motion of the particle. The
            particle is released by a source on the left, moves
            through a pair of parallel plates (parallel plates
            capacitor), and then on to a screen on the right. The
            screen is located where the <i>y</i>-axis is drawn.

              the Play button has been clicked, it changes into a
              Pause button. Click the Pause button if you want to
              get a 'snapshot' of the motion at a given instant.
              When the Pause button has been clicked, it reverts
              into the Play button. To resume the motion, click
              Play once more.

              Adjustments in the initial conditions and system

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>L</i>: width of the capacitor plates, i.e., width of
            the region where the electric field is non-zero.  The
            applet takes the region where the magnetic is non-zero to
            be identical with the region where the electric field is
            non-zero. Physically, this is not realistic.  Both fields
            are assumed to be uniform in this region.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>D</i>: horizontal distance from the right edge of
            the capacitor plates, i.e., from the region where the
            fields are non-zero, to the observation screen (not to
            be confused with the screen of the monitor in front of
            you). The location of the observation screen in the
            applet coincides with that of the <i>y</i>-axis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>y</i>: vertical deflection of the particle when it
            hits the observation screen. The <i>y</i> = 0 posiition
            on the <i>y</i>-axis corresponds to the
            straight-through undeflected direction.

          There are five sliders, shown in the following image.
          Clicking on a slider to the left or right of the slider

          Clicking on the Input Dialog button <img src=

          " top"> of a slider will open a dialog for entering an
          exact value for the slider setting. The dialog for the
          <i>v</i>-slider is illustrated below. The range in which
          values can be entered, from 50.0 m/s to 300.0 m/s in this

        <p>
          The five sliders in the control panel allow you to adjust
          the values of the following quantities.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>Speed</u>. The incoming speed <i>v</i> of the
            particle can be varied between 50.0 m/s and 300.0 m/s
            in steps of 0.1 m/s. The incoming direction of the
            particle cannot be varied. It is fixed to be in the
            <i>x</i>-direction and to the right.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Electric field</u>. The electric field <img src=
            "E.gif" align="bottom"> in the applet is always
            vertical on the screen, so that only its
            <i>y</i>-component is non-zero. The <i>y</i>-axis
            points upward and is indicated in the applet window. 
            <p>
              The field is confined to the region between the
              capacitor plates. It is indicated by small green
              arrows in the region between the plates. The applet
              takes the field to be uniform everywhere between the
              plates and zero everywhere else. The electric charges
              on the capacitor plates that give rise to the field
              are indicated by plus and minus signs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <i>y</i>-component <i>E<sub>y</sub></i> of the
              electric field can be varied between -300 V/m and 300
              V/m. The <i>y</i>-axis points upward and is indicated
              in the applet window.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Magnetic field</u>. The magnetic field <img src=
            "Bcap.gif" align="bottom"> is always perpendicular to
            the monitor screen and confined to the region between
            the capacitor plates. The field is indicated by the
            small orange circles (field pointing out of the monitor
            screen) or orange x's (field pointing into the monitor
            screen). The applet takes the field to be uniform
            everywhere between the plates and zero everywhere else.
            
            <p>
              Imagine a <i>z</i>-axis that is perpendicular to the
              monitor screen and pointing out of the screen. The
              <i>z</i>-component <i>B<sub>z</sub></i> of the
              magnetic field can be varied between -5.00 T and 5.00
              T.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Mass</u>. The mass <i>m</i> of the particle can be
            varied between 1.00 kg and 3.00 kg in steps of 0.01 kg.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Charge</u>. The charge <i>q</i> of the particle can
            be varied between -3.00 C and 3.00 C in steps of 0.01
            C. 
            <p>
              The color of the particle indicates the particle's
              charge: red means positive, blue means negative, and
              black means neutral.

          In a realistic laboratory experiment, the values of the
          speed of the particle and of its mass and charge may be
          unknown. They were unknown to Thomson. This situation can
          be simulated by the Hide Values button <img src=
          "HideValues.gif" alt="Hide Values" align="top">. It is
          the purpose of the experiment to use the remaining
          controls to determine the particle's speed and
          <i>q</i>/<i>m</i> ratio.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Hide Values button is clicked, the <i>v</i>,

        <p>
          In a realistic laboratory element, there would be a
          fluorescent screen to observe the deflection of a charged
          particle. The applet indicates this screen in the form of
          a <i>y</i>-axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The observation screen (<i>y</i>-axis) can be moved left
          or right by dragging it. By so doing one can change the
          width <i>L</i> of the capacitor. The distance <i>D</i>
          between the screen and the capacitor is set to a fixed
          value of 150.0 cm by the applet.
