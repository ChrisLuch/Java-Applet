    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Construct the set of green field lines and
      mustard-colored equipotential lines shown in Figure 1 below
      as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the Grid by selecting the Grid button <img src=
      "../elpotimages/Grid.gif" alt="Grid" align="top">. Then
      select the Coordinates button <img src=
      "../elpotimages/Coordinates.gif" alt="Coordinates" align="top">,
      and place location markers at
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (100,0),
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0,0).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each time a marker is placed, click the Field-Line button
      <img src="../elpotimages/FieldLine.gif" alt="Field Line"
      align="top"> to draw the green field line through the field
      point and the Equipotential-Line button <img src=
      "../elpotimages/EquipotentialLine.gif" alt=
      "Equipotential Line" align="top"> to draw the mustard-colored
      equipotential line through the field point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then hide the Grid by clicking the Grid button again, and
      deselect the Coordinates button. Move the particle to
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0,0).  The applet window should display
      the pattern shown in Figure 1 below.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Hint</u>. You may want to hold the SHIFT key down while
      moving the particle to its exact position, to restrict the
      direction of motion to horizontal or vertical. The
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)-coordinates of the particle are displayed
      in the Data box. The motion of a location marker can be
      similarly restricted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Select the Coordinates button again, move
      the mouse pointer to one of the existing location markers,
      click on the marker and drag it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair of field and equipotential lines through the marker
      should move along with the marker. Note how the value of the
      electric potential <i>V</i> at the point changes as you drag
      the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Deselect the Coordinates button. Then
      click on the tip of the green electric field vector and drag
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe how the field lines and equipotential lines through
      the fixed field points change so that the field lines stay
      parallel to the electric field vector and the equipotential
      lines perpendicular to the field lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to continue directly with Exercise 1 in the
      following section, make no further changes to the applet.

      Initial Position and Displacement
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Restore the applet to the state shown in
      Figure 1 above. If you are continuing directly from the
      previous Exercise 3, you have to do two things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        return the electric field vector to its initial value,
        which is (<i>E<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>E<sub>y</sub></i>) =
        (0,40) V/m; the easiest way to do this is to enter these
        values in the (<i>E<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>E<sub>y</sub></i>)
        data entry fields and to press ENTER; alternatively, you
        can drag the tip of the green electric field vector and
        watch the values in the data entry fields until they are
        back to the original setting;
      </li>
      <li>
        select the Coordinates button again and restore the
        location markers to their positions at 
        <ul>
          <li>
            (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (100,0),
          </li>
          <li>
            (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (200,100),
          </li>
          <li>
            (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (300,200),
          </li>
          <li>
            (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0,0),
          </li>
        </ul>and deselect the Coordinates button.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When this is done correctly, the electric potentials along
      the three displayed equipotential lines should be 0 V, -4000
      V, and -8000 V, when going in the positive <i>y</i>
      direction. These values will be shown in scientific notation,
      to three significant digits. Note that the notation "4.00E3"
      stands for "4.00&times;10<sup>3</sup>".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continue with the applet from the end of
      Exercise 1. This means the applet is in the state shown in
      Figure 1 above, with the particle at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) =
      (0,0) and (<i>E<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>E<sub>y</sub></i>) =
      (0,40) V/m.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the particle's displacement vector by selecting the
      Vectors button <img src="../elpotimages/Vectors.gif"
      alt="Vectors" align="top">. This will display a panel on which
      you can select the displacement vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you never clicked the Initial button <img src=
      "../elpotimages/Initial.gif" alt="Initial Position and Energy"
      align="top"> since last resetting the applet, you should see the
      image shown in Figure 2 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="../elpotimages/EPEOrigin.gif" alt=
      "Particle at Origin">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Figure 2, the particle's default position at
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (50,-50) m is indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blue displacement vector goes from the particle's default
      position to the particle's current position at
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0,0).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continue with the state of the applet as you
      left it in Exercise 2. Now click the Initial button <img
      src="../elpotimages/Initial.gif" alt="Initial Position and
      Energy" align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blue displacement vector should disappear. However, if
      you drag the particle with the mouse, the displacement vector
      will reappear, this time with its tail end at the location
      occupied by the particle when the Set-Initial-Position button
      was clicked, which in this case is the origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the Initial button again when the particle is not at the
      origin, and then drag the particle some more.  The displacement
      vector should be drawn from the location where the particle was
      when the Initial button was clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Continue with the applet from Exercise 3, and
      display the Energy box. Drag the particle again, and observe the
      energy column labeled "final". It gets adjusted during the
      dragging so that the potential energy column always represents
      the potential energy at the current particle position. The
      energy column labeled "initial" remains unchanged. It shows the
      particle's kinetic and potential energies at the moment the
      Initial button was clicked last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now click the Initial button, and observe the change in the
      "initial" energy column.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should find that the "initial" column gets adjusted to be
      identical to the "final" column. The current value of the
      potential energy has become the new initial value.

    <p>
      RESET the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. The Data box should be displayed
      automatically upon Reset. Drag the particle to the coordinate
      origin, (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0,0). The origin is located at
      the tail-end of the green electric field vector. The
      particle's current (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)-coordinates are
      displayed in the Data box. The Data box also shows the
      particle's potential energy in the electric field, <i>PE</i>,
      and the potential <i>V</i> at the particle's location.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the particle is at (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (0,0), both
      <i>PE</i> and <i>V</i> should be displayed as zero in the
      Data box. In the Energy box, the bar reprenting <i>V</i>
      should stop at the zero level, which is indicated by the
      horizontal line across all three bars. Similarly, the
      <i>PE</i> column in the bar labeled "final" should have its
      top at the zero level. The particle's kinetic energy,
      <i>KE</i>, is represented by the red portion of the bar above
      the potential energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Continuing from Exercise 1, click the Initial
      button. The energy bar labeled "initial" should get adjusted to
      look like the bar labeled "final".
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure the following settings are still in place:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        electric field: (<i>E<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>E<sub>y</sub></i>)
        = (0,40) V/m
      </li>
      <li>
        particle velocity:
        (<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) = (75,0) m/s
      </li>
      <li>
        particle charge: <i>q</i> = 2 C
      </li>
      <li>
        particle mass: <i>m</i> = 3.0 kg
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Select the Trace toggle button, and PLAY the motion. Observe the
      changes in the columns in the Energy box during the
      motion. PAUSE the motion at some point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particle should be moving on a parabolic path curving
      upward. As the particle is moving upward, both its potential
      energy, as indicated by the blue column in the "final" energy
      bar, and the potential at the particle's location, as
      indicated by the mustard-colored bar, should be decreasing.
      The values of these two quantities can also be observed in
      the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particle's total energy should remain constant, as
      indicated by the fact that the "final" energy bar maintains
      the same total height as the "initial" bar throughout the
      motion. The only change during the motion is in the
      composition of the "final" bar: the potential energy portion
      becomes smaller and the kinetic energy portion becomes
      larger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click REWIND and then PLAY to observe this again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Continuing from Exercise 2, click REWIND.
      Then reverse the sign of the charge so that <i>q</i> = -2 C
      instead of <i>q</i> = 2 C. Then PLAY the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the parabolic trajectory will curve downward.
      Again, the potential energy should be decreasing during the
      motion while the electric potential should be increasing.
      PAUSE the motion before the particle leaves the applet
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Resume the paused motion from Exercise 3
      by clicking PLAY again, and continue the motion until the bar
      representing <i>V</i> has grown beyond the height of the
      Energy box. PAUSE the motion again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now pull the Energy Zoom Slider in the Energy box downward,
      to decrease the scale of the energy bars. The top of the
      <i>V</i>-bar should come back into view and so should the top
      of the <i>PE</i>-column. Resume the motion once more, and
      drag the Energy Zoom Slider further downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you keep the motion running, the top ends of the potential
      bar and of the potential energy column will be above and
      below the applet window, respectively, and therefore
      unobservable. However, you can continue to observe the values
      of the potential and of the potential energy, as well as
      those of other quantities, in the Data box and in the
      Velocity data fields.
