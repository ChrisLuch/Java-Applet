<div class="title">Assumptions - Potential Energy and Potential In A
Uniform Field</div>

    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet simulates the motion of a charged particle in a
      uniform electric field, displays the particle's potential and
      kinetic energies, and displays the electric potential at the
      particle's location and at other selected locations.
    </div>

    <p>The applet makes the following assumptions:

	 <p><ul>

	 <li>A particle of charge <i>q</i> and mass <i>m</i> is moving
	 in a uniform electric field, and apart from the force exerted
	 on the particle by the electric field no other forces are
	 acting on the particle.</li>

	 <li>The electric field is not affected by the particle, i.e.,
	 any effects that the particle may have on the source charges
	 producing the field are neglible.  Such a particle is called
	 a <i>test particle</i>.  It <i>tests</i> the field that exists
	 without the particle's presence.</li>

	 <li>Consistent with the previous assumption, when using the
	 law of energy conservation for the system, the source charges
	 are taken to be at rest so that no kinetic energy of the
	 source charges needs to be included in the total energy.</li>

	 <li>The electric potential <i>V</i> is taken to be equal to
	 zero at the coordinate origin.  Consistent with that, the
	 particle's potential energy <i>PE</i> in the electric field
	 is also taken to be zero at the orgin.</li>

	 </ul>
