  <p><b>Definition of Momentum</b>

  <blockquote>The <i>momentum</i> of a particle of mass <i>m</i> and velocity <img src="v.gif"
  align="bottom"> is defined as the product

  <p align="center"><img src="p.gif" align="top"> = <i>m</i>
  <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> . <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (1)</p>

  <p>As the definition implies, momentum is a vector quantity.  It is
  denoted by the symbol <img src="p.gif" align="absbottom">.  The
  momentum vector points in the same direction as the velocity vector.

  <p>The (total) momentum <img src="Pcap.gif" align="top"> of a
  system of particles, denoted by a capital <i>P</i> with arrow, is
  defined as the vector sum of the momenta of the individual
  particles,

  <p align="center"><img src="PEquation.gif"> . <img src="small.gif"
  height="1" width="50"> (2)</p></blockquote>

  <p><b>Law of Momentum Conservation</b>

  <blockquote><u>Version A</u>.  The total momentum of an isolated system of
  particles is conserved.

  <p><u>Version B</u>.  The total momentum of a system of particles is
  conserved if the total external force acting on the system is zero.

  <p><u>Comments</u>.  Version A is a special case of Version B.  If a
  system is isolated, i.e., not interacting with anything external to
  the system, the system does not experience any external forces
  whatsoever so that the sum of such forces is obviously zero.

  <p>In Version B, the system does not have to be isolated but can be
  interacting with its environment.  In this case, the total momentum
  of the system still is conserved, as long as the external forces add
  up to zero.</blockquote>

  <p>The law of momentum conservation is a consequence of Newton's
  third and second laws.  

  <p><b>Newton's Third Law</b>

<blockquote>If an object 1 exerts a force on another object 2, then
object 2 also exerts a force on object 1.  The two forces have the
same magnitude and opposite directions.</blockquote>

<p align="center"><img src="CollisionNewton3.gif"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

<p>Figure 1 illustrates Newton's third law for the case of two
gravitationally interacting objects.  <img src="F.gif"
align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> is the force exerted on object 1 by object
2.  <img src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>2</sub> is the force exerted

<p><u>Comments</u>. Even though the objects have different masses, the
forces the objects exert on each other have the same magnitude, as the
green force vectors show.

<p>Gravitational forces are long-range forces that are "felt" by the
interacting objects even when the objects are very far apart.  See
Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation below.  Newton's Third Law
applies to forces whether they are long-range or short-range (contact
forces).

<p><b>Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation</b>

<blockquote>Any two particles interact with each other
gravitationally.  Particle 1 exerts a force on Particle 2, and
Particle 2 exerts a force on Particle 1.  These forces are attractive
and directed from particle to particle.  If the particles have masses
<i>m</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> and are a distance
<i>r</i> apart, the magnitude <i>F</i> of either force is given by

  <p align="center"><i>F</i> = <i>G</i>
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><i>m</i><sub>2</sub> / <i>r</i><sup>2</sup>,
  <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (3)</p>

<p>where <i>G</i> is the <i>constant of universal gravitation</i>.  In
SI-units, <i>G</i> has the value

<p align="center"><i>G</i> = 6.67&times;10<sup>-11</sup> N
m<sup>2</sup> kg<sup>-2</sup>. <img src="small.gif" height="1"
width="50"> (4) </p>

</blockquote>

<p><u>Comments</u>.  The term "particle" in the statement above means
"point particle", i.e., a particle of negligble extent.  Real objects
are extended objects.  Their gravitational interaction is the result
of the interactions of all the particles constituting the objects.
The total gravitational force exerted on one extended object by
another is the vector sum of the forces exerted on all the particles
of the object by all the particles of the other.

<p>One can prove that an extended object that is spherical in shape
and has uniform mass density acts gravitationally as if all of its
mass were concentrated at its center.  Such an object can therefore be
represented by a point particle at the object's center, where the
point particle carries all of the extended object's mass.

<p>Extended objects, e.g., the earth and the moon, will be treated
here as if they were point particles located at the centers of these
objects.


<p><b>Newton's Second Law of Motion</b>

  <p>The forces acting on a particle determine the particle's motion via
  Newton's Second Law of Motion.  Newton stated the law in the form that

  <blockquote>the vector sum of all forces acting on a particle is
  equal to the time-rate-of-change of the particle's
  momentum.</blockquote>

  <p>If <img src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>net</sub> denotes the sum
  of all forces (net force) acting on the particle, Newton's Second Law amounts to the
  equation

  <p align="center"><img src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>net</sub> =
  <i>d</i><img src="p.gif" align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (5)

  <p>where <i>d</i><img src="p.gif" align="absbottom">/<i>dt</i> is
  the time-rate-of-change of the particle's momentum. One can think of
  <nobr><i>d</i><img src="p.gif" align="absbottom">/<i>dt</i></nobr>
  as the ratio of a very small momentum change <nobr><i>d</i><img
  src="p.gif" align="absbottom"></nobr> and a very short time interval
  <i>dt</i>.

  <p>If the mass <i>m</i> is constant, this equation, using Definition
  (1) of the momentum, can be rewritten as follows:

  <p align="center"><img src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>net</sub> =
  <i>d</i><img src="p.gif" align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> =
  <i>d</i>(<i>m</i><img src="v.gif"
  align="bottom">)/<i>dt</i> =
  <i>m</i><i>d</i><img src="v.gif"
  align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> = <i>m</i> <img
  src="a.gif" align="bottom"> <img src="small.gif"
  height="1" width="50"> (6)

  <p>where the time-rate-of-change of the velocity, <i>d</i><img src="v.gif"
  align="bottom">/<i>dt</i>, has been replaced by the acceleration <img
  src="a.gif" align="bottom">.

  <p>In this form, Newton's Second Law in words says that

  <blockquote>the sum of all forces acting on a particle is equal to
  the product of the particle's mass and the particle's
  acceleration.</blockquote>

  <p><b>Task 1</b>. Reset <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset"
  align="top"> the applet.

  <p>Set the mass of Planet 1 (Planet on the left) to 7,000.  This will
  automatically set the mass of Planet 2 to 3,000.  The combined mass
  of both planets is always 10,000.  PLAY and PAUSE the motion until
  the planets are a distance of approximately <i>r</i> = 338.4 apart.
  You can try to get quite close to this value by pausing the motion
  before <i>r</i> reaches this value and then moving towards it using
  the STEP button.

  <p>Calculate the magnitudes <i>F</i><sub>1</sub> and
  <i>F</i><sub>2</sub> of the gravitational forces the planets exert
  on each other.  Here the calculation will be done for <i>r</i> =
  338.4, but you should carry out the calculation also for the
  <i>r</i>-value at which you paused the motion.  The Data box will
  provide the answer corresponding to your value of <i>r</i>.

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  

  <p>Newton's Third Law implies <i>F</i><sub>1</sub> =
  <i>F</i><sub>2</sub>.  Let us denote this common magnitude by
  <i>F</i>.

  <p>The units of all physical quantities are left unspecified in this
  applet, and the value of <i>G</i> is taken to be equal to 6.67.
  Substituting this value into Equation (3), along with the values of
  the masses of the planets and their separation center-to-center (the
  planets are replaced by mass points), gives for the magnitude
  <i>F</i> the value

  <p align="center"><i>F</i> = <i>G</i>
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><i>m</i><sub>2</sub> / <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> =
  6.67&times;7000&times;3000 / 338.4<sup>2</sup> =
  1.223&times;10<sup>3</sup>. <img src="small.gif" height="1"
  width="50"> (7)

  <p><b>Task 2</b>.  REWIND the applet.  Adjust the masses of the two
  planets so that <i>F</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>F</i><sub>2</sub> =
  <i>F</i> has maximum magnitude.  Try to explain your observation.

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  <i>F</i> is greatest when the two masses are
  equal, i.e., when both are equal to 5000.

  <p>This can be explained as follows.  Remember that the total mass
  of the two planets is fixed at 10,000 and that the distance between
  the two planets is constant while the individual masses are being
  varied.

  <p>If the distance <i>r</i> is constant, Newton's law of universal
  gravitation implies that <i>F</i> is proportional to the product
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><i>m</i><sub>2</sub> of the two masses.  This
  product is zero when either <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> or
  <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> is zero.  When <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> and
  <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> are both greater than zero and less than
  10,000, the product is positive.  (If one of the masses is greater
  than 10,000, the other would have to be negative so that the sum of
  the masses stays equal to 10,000.  This would, of course, not be
  possible in reality.)

  <p>Thus, <i>F</i> is zero when <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> is either 0 or
  10,000 and it is positive if <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> is in between
  these limits.  This implies that <i>F</i> has a maximum in the range
  0 &lt; <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> &lt; 10,000.  By symmetry, this maximum
  must be at <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> = 5000.

  <p>A second argument involves an algebraic demonstration.  The
  product <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><i>m</i><sub>2</sub> can be written

  <p><img src="small.gif" height="1"
  width="30"><i>m</i><sub>1</sub><i>m</i><sub>2</sub> =
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>(10,000 - <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>) = -
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 10,000<i>m</i><sub>1</sub>

  <p><img src="small.gif" height="1" width="205">= -
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 10,000<i>m</i><sub>1</sub> -
  5,000<sup>2</sup> + 5,000<sup>2</sup>

  <p><img src="small.gif" height="1" width="205">=
  - (<i>m</i><sub>1</sub> - 5,000)<sup>2</sup> + 5,000<sup>2</sup>.
  <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (8)

  <p>The right-hand side of Equation (8) when plotted against
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> gives a parabola that goes downward on either
  side of its peak, which is at <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> = 5,000.  It goes
  downward because of the minus sign in front of the quadratic term.
  Thus, <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><i>m</i><sub>2</sub> has a peak at
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> = 5,000.

  <p>To corroborate that Equation (8) is correct, check that it gives the
  value zero for <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><i>m</i><sub>2</sub> when
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> = 0 or 10,000.

  <p>Also note that Equation (8) immediately gives the maximum value
  of <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><i>m</i><sub>2</sub> as 5,000<sup>2</sup>.
  Just substitute <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> = 5,000.

  <p><a name="Motion"><div class="sectionheading">The System's Motion
  and Changes in Velocity and Momentum</div></a>

  <p><b>Task 1</b>.  With the masses still at <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> =
  7000 and <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> = 3000, start from the point where you
  paused the motion earlier.  Here this will be assumed to have been
  at <i>r</i> = 338.4 at <i>t</i> = 31.5.  At this point, the Data box
  displays the values shown in Figure 2 below.

  <p align="center"><img src="CollisionData.gif"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

  <p>Click the STEP button once to advance the motion by 0.1 in time
  to <i>t</i> = 31.6. At this instant, the Data box displays the
  values shown in Figure 3 below.

  <p align="center"><img src="CollisionNextPoint.gif"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 3</b></p>

  <p>Calculate the magnitudes of velocity and momentum of the planets
  and their separation at <i>t</i> = 31.6 from the data at <i>t</i> =
  31.5.

  <p><u>Hint</u>: You may take the forces to be constant during this
  short time interval.  Comparing the values of the forces as
  displayed in Figures 2 and 3, you can see that this is not a bad
  assumption.  Also see Comment 1 in the following Answer.

  <p><b>Answer</b>.

  <p><u>Momenta</u>.  Newton's second law of motion (5) applied to
  Planet 1 gives the equation

  <p align="center"><img src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> =
  <i>d</i><img src="p.gif" align="bottom"><sub>1</sub>/<i>dt</i> <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (9)

  <p>Solving for the momentum change <i>d</i><img src="p.gif"
  align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> we get

  <p align="center"><i>d</i><img src="p.gif" align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> =
  <img src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>1</sub><i>dt</i> <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (10)

  <p>Using this equation for the short but finite time invertal from
  <i>t</i> = 31.5 to <i>t</i> = 31.6 and working only with the
  magnitudes of the vectors gives

  <p align="center"><i>dp</i><sub>1</sub> =
  <i>F</i><sub>1</sub><i>dt</i> = 1.22&times;10<sup>3</sup>&times;0.1
  = 1.22&times;10<sup>2</sup> = 0.01&times;10<sup>4</sup>. <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (11)

  <p>Adding this value to the value <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> =
  2.33&times;10<sup>4</sup> at <i>t</i> = 31.5, because the force is
  in the same direction as the momentum and the momentum's magnitude
  therefore increasing, gives for the magnitude of the momentum at
  <i>t</i> = 31.6 the value

  <p align="center"><i>p</i><sub>1</sub> = 2.33&times;10<sup>4</sup> +
  0.01&times;10<sup>4</sup> = 2.34&times;10<sup>4</sup>.<img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (12)

  <p><u>Comment 1</u>.  To the precision of three significant figures
  used in this calculation, the assumption of constant force
  throughout the given time interval in Equations (11) is perfectly
  valid.  As you can see from the calculation, the third significant
  digit in the force, which is the one that is changing during this
  time interval, has no effect on the outcome of the calculation
  because multiplication by the time factor of 0.1 in Equations (11)
  suppresses this digit, and even the one before.

  <p>The momentum of Planet 2 at <i>t</i> = 31.6 can be calculated
  similarly.  Since the force acting on Planet 2 has the same
  magnitude as the force acting on Planet 1, by Newton's Third Law,
  the magnitude <i>dp</i><sub>2</sub> of the momentum change for
  Planet 2 is the same as for Planet 1 and is given by Result (11).
  
  <p>Since the force acting on Planet 2 is in the direction of the
  planet's momentum (by Newton's Third Law, this force is opposite to
  that acting on Planet 1, but the momentum of Planet 2 also is
  opposite to that of Planet 1), the magnitude of the momentum of
  Planet 2, like that of Planet 1, increases to the same value (12) as
  the momentum of Planet 1.

  <p>Since the momenta of the two planets and the momentum changes
  <i>d</i><img src="p.gif"><sub>1</sub> and <i>d</i><img
  src="p.gif"><sub>2</sub> are oppositely directed, the sum of these
  changes is zero,

  <p align="center"><i>d</i><img src="p.gif"><sub>1</sub> +
  <i>d</i><img src="p.gif"><sub>2</sub> = 0. <img src="small.gif"
  height="1" width="50"> (13)

  <p>This means that the total momentum of the two-planet system does
  not change.  We have proved the law of momentum conservation for
  the system!  The same argument can be applied for any other time
  interval.  Note how both Newton's third and second laws enter into
  the argument.

  <p><u>Comment 2</u>.  At <i>t</i> = 31.6, the momenta of the two
  planets have different magnitudes than at <i>t</i> = 31.5.  However,
  at both times the two magnitudes are equal to each other and the
  momenta are oppositely directly, so that at both times the total
  momentum is zero and therefore conserved.

  <p><u>Speeds and Velocities</u>.  The speed of Planet 1 at <i>t</i>
  = 31.6 is obtained by dividing the magnitude of the momentum by the
  mass of the planet.  Thus,

  <p align="center"><i>v</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> /
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> = 2.34&times;10<sup>4</sup>/7000 = 3.34 , <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"><i>t</i> = 31.6.<img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (14)

  <p><u>Comment 3</u>. This differs by "1" in the last digit from
  the value shown in Figure 3.  This is due to round-off error.
  Suppose a value of <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> = 2.343 instead of 2.340 had
  been used in Calculation (14). The result for <i>v</i><sub>1</sub>
  would have been 3.347 which rounds up to 3.35, the value given in
  Figure 3.  Using only three significant digits for
  <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> instead of 4 can lead to this kind of an error.

  <p>The speed of Particle 2 at <i>t</i> = 31.6 is calculated
  similarly as

  <p align="center"><i>v</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> /
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> = 2.34&times;10<sup>4</sup>/3000 = 7.80 , <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"><i>t</i> = 31.6.<img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (15)

  <p>Again, this differs in the last significant digit from the value
  shown in Figure 3.  Using 2.343 for <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> would give
  7.81 for <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>, in agreement with the value in Figure
  3.

  <p>The velocities of the planets at <i>t</i> = 31.6 are oppositely
  directly and have the magnitudes given by Results (14) and (15).

  <p><u>Separation of the Planets</u>.  The separation <i>r</i>
  between the planets changes because <b>both</b> planets move.  Since
  one planet is moving to the right and the other one to the left,
  <i>r</i> changes at a rate equal to the <b>negative sum</b> of the
  speeds of both planets.  We must take the <b>negative</b> of the sum
  because <i>r</i> is decreasing and its rate-of-change therefore
  negative.

  <p>Making a similar assumption to that used in calculating the
  momentum change earlier, we assume that the speeds are constant
  during the short 0.1-time interval.  The mistake will be negligible
  to within the precision used here. (See Comment 4 below.) Thus, from
  the equation for the time-rate-of-change of the separation <i>r</i>,

  <p align="center"><i>dr</i> / <i>dt</i> = -(<i>v</i><sub>1</sub> +
  <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>), <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="50">
  (16)

  <p>we get

  <p align="center"><i>dr</i> = - (<i>v</i><sub>1</sub> +
  <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>) <i>dt</i> = -(3.33 + 7.77)&times;0.1 = -1.11
  . <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (17)

  <p>Adding this change to the value of <i>r</i> at <i>t</i> = 31.5
  gives at <i>t</i> = 31.6 the value

  <p align="center"><i>r</i> = 338.4 - 1.11 = 337.3 , <img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"><i>t</i> = 31.6.<img
  src="small.gif" height="1" width="50"> (17)

  <p>This agrees with the value shown in Figure 3 to the last
  significant digit. 

  <p><u>Comment 4</u>.  In Calculation (17) the values for
  <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>v</i><sub>2</sub> at <i>t</i> = 31.5 are
  used.  We could also have used the values at <i>t</i> = 31.6 without
  affecting the result within the number of significant digits
  considered.  This justifies the assumption of constant speeds.

  <p><u>Final Comment</u>. The kind of approximate numerical
  calculations used here to calculate the values of physical
  quantities at <i>t</i> = 31.6 from those at <i>t</i> = 31.5 using
  the forces as the physical input, shows how the forces determine the
  motion of a system.  Although calculating in this manner involves
  some inaccuracies, these can be reduced by choosing smaller time
  steps.  In principle, by making the time steps infinitesimally
  small, the calculation can be made perfectly exact.  This limiting
  process underlies the calculus operation called "integration".  What
  we have done here is a "numerical integration".  In simulating
  motions on a computer, one has to perform numerical integrations,
  which always involve a certain degree of approximation.

  <p><b>Challenge Task</b>.  Select the Pause-Before-Collision radio
  button and let the motion continue until the planets touch, just
  before collision.  Observe the total time elapsed from the start of
  the motion.  Repeat the motion with different planet masses, and
  again observe the total time elapsed up to contact.  Do this a third
  time, with yet another set of planet masses.

  <p>What do you observe about the times elapsed? Explain your observation.

  <p><b>Answer</b>.  The same amount of time, 45.2, elapses no matter
  what the masses are.  This can be explained as follows.

  <p>Note that the applet is designed so that the separations at the
  start and at the moment of contact are independent of the masses of
  the planets.  Verify this if you did not already observe it yourself.

  <p>The magnitudes <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> of
  the planets' accelerations when the planets are a distance <i>r</i>
  apart, center to center, are determined by combining Newton's second
  law of motion with Newton's universal law of gravitation.  Thus, for
  Planet 1,

  <p align="center"><i>F</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>G</i>
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><i>m</i><sub>2</sub> / <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> =
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><i>a</i><sub>1</sub> . <img src="small.gif"
  height="1" width="50"> (18)

  <p>Canceling a factor of <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> on both sides of the
  equation gives an equation for <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>,

  <p align="center"><i>a</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>G</i>
  <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> / <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> . <img src="small.gif"
  height="1" width="50"> (19)

  <p>Similarly, derive the following equation for
  <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>:

  <p align="center"><i>a</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>G</i>
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> / <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> . <img src="small.gif"
  height="1" width="50"> (20)

  <p>The change in the separation <i>r</i> is the result of
  <b>both</b> planets moving.  As in the earlier calculation of a
  change in <i>r</i>, the acceleration with which <i>r</i> changes is
  the <b>negative sum</b> of the magnitudes of the two planets'
  accelerations,

  <p align="center">-(<i>a</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>) =
  -(<i>G</i> <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> / <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>G</i>
  <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> / <i>r</i><sup>2</sup>) = -<i>G</i>
  (<i>m</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>m</i><sub>2</sub>) /
  <i>r</i><sup>2</sup>. <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="50">

  <p>At a given separation <i>r</i>, this acceleration depends only on
  the <b>sum</b> of the masses of the two planets, not on the
  individual masses separately.  Since the sum of the planets is
  constant in our set-up, the acceleration of the separation <i>r</i>
  is independent of the masses of the planets.  This explains why it
  takes the same amount of time for the planets to have their
  separation reduced by a fixed amount.
