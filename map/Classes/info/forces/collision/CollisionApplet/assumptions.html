<div class="title">Assumptions - Colliding Planets</div>

<p><div class="sectionheading">The applet shows two planets in head-on
motion. The applet displays the gravitational forces the planets
exert on each other and shows how the speeds, momenta, and kinetic
energies of the two planets, and the potential energy and total
mechanical energy of the system vary during the motion.</div>



<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p>It is assumed that the planets' densities are uniform so that the
planets act gravitationally as if all their masses were concentrated
at their centers and the planets act like mass points.

<p>The additive constant in the potential energy is chosen so that the
potential energy of the system is zero when the two planets are
infinitely far apart.  Since the gravitational potential energy
decreases as the planets move closer, the potential energy is
therefore negative at finite planet separations.  The same is true for
the total energy if the planets start from rest at some finite
separation.
