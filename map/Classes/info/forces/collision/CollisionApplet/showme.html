      ShowMe - Colliding Planets
    </div>
    <div class="sectionheading">
      The applet shows two planets in head-on motion. The applet
      displays the gravitational forces the planets exert on each
      other and shows how the speeds, momenta, and kinetic energies
      of the two planets, and the potential energy and total
      mechanical energy of the system vary during the motion.

      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This page is designed to get you started using the applet.
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on
      this page are to be done in the applet. You may need to
      toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if your
      screen space is limited.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Reset <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset"
      align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set the mass of Planet 1 (on the left) to 7,000. This will
      automatically set the mass of Planet 2 to 3,000. The combined
      mass of both planets is always 10,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the Forces button <img src="Forces.gif" alt=
      "Forces button" align="top"> to display the gravitational
      forces <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align=
      "bottom"><sub>1</sub> and <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
      align="bottom"><sub>2</sub> acting on the two planets. They
      are represented by green arrows of equal lengths pointing in
      opposite directions, from one planet towards the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Select the Data button <img src="Data.gif"
      alt="Data" align="top"> to display the Data box. Observe the
      value of the distance <i>r</i> between the planets shown in
      the Data box. This value depends on the size of the applet
      window. If <i>r</i> is not equal to 492.0, adjust the size of
      the applet window by dragging the window in its lower
      right-hand corner until <i>r</i> = 492.0. For this value of
      <i>r</i>, the Data box shows the following values for the
      magnitudes of the two forces: <i>F</i><sub>1</sub> =
      <i>F</i><sub>2</sub> = 5.79E2 = 5.79&times;10<sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnitudes are calculated according to the equation
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>F</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>F</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>G</i>
      <i>m</i><sub>1</sub><i>m</i><sub>2</sub> /

    <p>
      All physical quantities in the applet are in unspecified
      units.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. Move the Zoom slider to settings smaller
      than 100% so that the two planets are not so close to the
      edge of the applet window. Observe that the Zoom setting
      affects both the length scale and the size of the arrows
      representing the forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag the Data box partially off-screen so that it does not
      cover any of the planets. If you drag the Data box fully
      off-screen, you can get it back by clicking Reset.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Keep the mass settings and window size
      from the previous section, but set the Zoom slider back to
      100%. PLAY the motion, and PAUSE it before the planets
      collide. Depending on where you pause, you will get a display
      similar to that shown in Figure 1 below.

    <p>
      The momentum and force vectors will have equal magnitudes,
      but the velocity of Planet 2 will have a greater magnitude
      than that of Planet 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure the Pause-Before-Collision radio button is
      unselected, resume the motion by clicking PLAY and watch the
      planets collide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then go through the following sequence of operations and
      observations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click REWIND and again PLAY. Observe that the center of
        mass of the two planets remains stationary during the
        motion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click REWIND, PLAY, and then PAUSE before the collision.
        Set the Zoom slider to a smaller setting and observe the
        change in the display.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check the Pause-Before-Collision radio button and click
        resume the motion by clicking PLAY. The motion will stop
        automatically just before impact.
      </li>
      <li>
        Zoom out all the way to 25% to show as much of the vectors
        as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Uncheck the Pause-Before-Collision radio button to make the
        planets collide.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet, and set the mass of Planet
      2 to <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> = 3,000.  This will automatically set
      the mass of Planet 1 to <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> = 7,000. Select the
      Forces toggle button <img src="Forces.gif" alt="Forces button"
      align="top">. The forces acting on the two planets are
      represented by green arrows. Observe that the arrows have equal
      lengths.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion and PAUSE it before the planets collide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the Velocities <img src="Velocities.gif" alt= "Velocities
      button" align="top"> button to display the velocities of the two
      planets (in magenta). Observe that Planet 1, which has the
      larger mass, has a velocity arrow of shorter length than Planet
      2. Display the momenta of the two planets (in blue) by selecting
      the <img src="Momenta.gif" alt="Momenta button" align="top">,
      and observe that the momentum arrows of the two planets have the
      same length.  Figure 2 illustrates a typical situation. The size
      of the vectors depends on which point you have paused the
      motion.
