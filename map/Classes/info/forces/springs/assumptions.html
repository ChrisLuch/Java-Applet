      The applet simulates the forces acting on a vertically moving
      block. The block is supported by springs that in turn are
      resting on a platform (Table). The table can move upward or
      downward.

	 <p>
      The motion of the block-springs-table system is shown in the
      steady when all parts of the system move with the same constant
      acceleration.
    </p>
	 <p>
		When the acceleration is changed from one value to another, the
      system again realizes its new steady state instantly.  Any
      initial oscillations of the springs in response to a new table
      acceleration are not simulated.
