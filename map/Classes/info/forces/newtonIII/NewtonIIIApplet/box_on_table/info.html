            The applet provides two methods for selecting a force: 
				<br><br>
				<ul>
				  <li> 
				    A. By selecting a force vector in a free-body diagram
				    by clicking on it (the selected vector is shown

				    outline when selecting a reaction force).<br><br>
              </li>
				  <li>
				    B. By describing a force verbally by means of either
				    the Force or Reaction Force sets of pull-down menus.
				    There are three menus in each set.  For details, see
				    Point 3 below.
              </li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				The two methods will be referred to as Method A and Method
            B in the following.  
				<br><br>
				You will be expected to select forces or their reaction
            forces by either Method A or Method B and to SUBMIT your
            selection for feedback from the applet by clicking the
            SUBMIT button.

        <p>
          The Comment text field displays the comments "Correct",
          "Incorrect", "Not a force", "Negligible", or displays
          no comment at all when SUBMIT is pressed.
        </p>
		  <p>
          When "Correct" is displayed, press NEXT to continue on to
          another task.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          When "Incorrect" is displayed, you can modify your response
          and SUBMIT again or you can GIVE UP if you do not know the
          answer.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          The Comment "Not a force" means that you have selected a
          triplet of words from either the Force or Reaction Force
          drop-down menus (see Point 3) that does not correspond to a
          force.  An example is "(normal, box, box)".  No object can
          exert a force on itself.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    The Comment "Negligible" means that the force selected from
			 either the Force or Reaction Force drop-down menus is
			 negligible in magnitude to the other forces in the free-body
			 diagram.  Such forces are not included in the free-body
			 diagrams.
        </p>
		  <p>
		    If the Comment is "Not a force" or "Negligible", make
		    another selection and SUBMIT again or GIVE UP.

          The control panel contains two rows of drop-down menus with
          three drop-down menus in each row.  The two sets of menus
          are labeled "Force" and "Reaction Force".  See the preceding
          image.  The Reaction Force menus are used only in the two
          Reaction Force modes.  (See Point 4 below.)
        </p>
		  <p>
          Either set of menus are used to specify a force by selecting
          appropriate words from the three drop-down menus in the set.
          The menus allow you to select only forces exerted by one
          part of the box-table-earth system on one of the other three
          parts.  Such forces are either normal contact forces or
          gravitational forces.  The preceding image illustrates how
          to select the "normal force exerted by the box on the table"
          by selecting the words "normal", "box", and "table" from the
          three Force drop-down menus.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          Certain combinations of words do not identify a possible
          force.  An object cannot exert a force on itself.  Thus the
          combination "(normal, box, box)" does not identify a force.
          If a combination like this is chosen from the drop-down
          menus, the applet responds with "Not a force" in the Comment
          text field.  To continue, choose another combination of
          words from the drop-down menus.  The response "Not a force"
          is also given for the combination "(normal, box, earth)"
          because the box is not in direct contact with the earth and
          therefore cannot exert a normal force on the earth.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          The combination "(gravitational, table, box)" produces the
          comment "Negligible" because the gravitational force exerted
          by the table on the box is totally negligible compared to
          the other possible forces.  If the applet gives the comment
          "Negligible", you can continue by choosing another
          combination of words from the drop-down menus.

          The applet can be run in four modes, called "Force", "Force
          Review", "Reaction Force", "Reaction Force Review".  The
          mode is selected by clicking one of the four radio buttons.
          The four modes function as follows.
        </p>
		  <p>
          The description of the modes refers to Methods A and B that
          are defined above under Point 1, Control Buttons, Submit.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          <i>Force Mode</i>.  This mode provides practice in
          identifying the forces exerted by a part of the
          box-table-earth system on another part and in describing
          these forces verbally.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          Select a force by either Method A or B.  The SUBMIT button
          becomes active.  When it is pressed, the applet responds as
          follows:
        </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <u>force chosen by the user via Method A</u>: the
                applet identifies the force via Method B, renders the
                force vector in the free-body diagram in the
                appropriate color (see Point 5, Free-Body Diagrams),
                and adds the force vector to the image of the physical
                system with the tail end of the vector at the point
                where the force is acting.<br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>force chosen by the user via Method B</u>: the
                applet identifies the force via Method A and adds the
                force vector to the image of the physical system; or,
                if no force exists that corresponds to the three words
                selected via Method B, the applet gives the feedback
                "Not a force" in the Comment text field; if the
                magnitude of the force chosen is negligible and the
                force therefore not considered by the applet, the
                feedback "Negligible" is given.
              </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
         You can continue by selecting another force via Method A or
			Method B.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          <i>Force Review Mode</i>.  In this mode, the applet
          initially selects a force by either Method A or B.  You are
          expected to select the same force by the "other" Method, the
          one not used by the applet.  If the applet selects a force
          by Method B, the words in the Force menus are shown dimmed
          because the menus are inactive so that the selection cannot
          be changed.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          SUBMIT your response.  The applet will give the feedback
          "Correct", "Incorrect", "Not a force", or "Negligible" in
          the Comment text field.
        </p>
		  <p>
          If the feedback is "Incorrect", "Not a force", or
          "Negligible", change your selection and SUBMIT again.  If
          necessary, you can also GIVE UP.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    If the feedback is "Correct" or if you pressed GIVE UP, the
          Next button is made active.  Press NEXT to continue on to
          another force.
        </p>
		  <p>
			 The applet selects the possible eight forces in random order
          until all eight forces have been selected.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          <i>Reaction Force Mode</i>.  This mode provides practice in
          identifying the Newton's-third-law reaction force to a force
          chosen by you.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          Select a force by either Method A or B.  The SUBMIT button
          is made active.  When you SUBMIT, the applet responds as
          follows:
		  </p>	 
            <ul>
              <li>
                <u>force chosen by user via Method A</u>: the applet
                selects the force via Method B, renders the force
                vector in the free-body diagram in the appropriate
                color (see Point 5, Free-Body Diagrams), adds the
                force vector to the image of the physical system with
                the tail end of the vector at the point where the
                force is acting, indicates the reaction force vector
                by both Methods A and B, and adds the reaction force
                vector to the image of the physical system.  <br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>force chosen by user via Method B</u>: the applet
                selects the force via Method A, adds the force vector
                in the image of the physical system, selects the
                reaction force by both Methods A and B, and adds the
                reaction force vector to the image of the physical
                system; or, if no force exists that corresponds to the
                three words selected via Method B, the applet gives
                the feedback "Not a force" in the Comment text field;
                the applet gives the feedback "Negligible" if the
                magnitude of the force is neglible compared to the
                other forces and this force therefore is not included
                in the free-body diagrams.
				 </li>
			   </ul>
         <p>
			  You can continue by selecting another force via Method A or
			  Method B.
			</p>
		  <p>
          A reaction force is represented by an arrow in "inverted"
          colors, i.e., with an outline in the color of the
          corresponding force vector but with a white interior.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          The words shown by the applet in the Reaction Force menus
          are shown dimmed because the menus are inactive so that
          their display cannot be changed.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          <i>Reaction Force Review Mode</i>.  In this mode, the applet
          selects a force, by both Methods A and B, and shows the
          force vector in the image of the box-table-earth system.
          The words in the Force menus are shown dimmed because the
          menus are inactive so that the selection cannot be changed.
        </p>
		  <p>
          You are expected to select the corresponding reaction force,
          by either Method A or Method B.  Press SUBMIT when you have
          done this.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          The applet provides appropriate feedback in the Comment text
          field as desribed under <i>Reaction Force Mode</i> above.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          If the applet's response is anything other than "Correct",
          you can change your response and SUBMIT again or GIVE UP.
          If the applet responds with "Correct" or if you pressed GIVE
          UP, you can press NEXT to continue.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          The applet presents the eight possible forces in random
          order until the reaction forces to all eight forces have
          been identified.

          The applet displays a free-body diagram for each of the
          three parts of the system, the box, the table, and the
          earth.
        </p>
		  <p>
          Initially, all force vectors are shown in grey.  When a
          force vector is selected, it is highlighted in solid black;
          it is highlighted in white with a black outline if a
          reaction force is selected.  After a SUBMIT, the highligted
          vector is rendered in color, blue for a normal force and
          green for a gravitational force.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			 An action-reaction force pair has both vectors represented
          in the same color because if one member of the pair is a
          normal (gravitational) force then so is the other one.
          However, a reaction force is represented by an arrow in
          "inverted" colors, i.e., with an outline in the color of the
          corresponding force vector and a white interior.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          In the preceding image of the three free-body diagrams, the
          diagram for the box has the gravitational force exerted by
          the earth on the box selected in green and the diagram for
          the earth has the corresponding reaction force, which is the
          gravitational force exerted by the box on the earth, selected
          in "inverted green".
		  </p>
		  <p>
          You can select a vector in a free-body diagram by clicking
          on it.  To change your selection, click on another vector.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          The normal force exerted by the earth on the table consists
          of four separate normal forces exerted on the legs of the
          table.  The free-body diagram for the table shows the
          <b>total</b> normal force exerted by the earth on the table,
          which is the sum of these four separate forces.  The same
          applies to other forces that are composed of several smaller
          forces.

          The arrows representing forces are drawn to scale,
          conforming to the assumption that the table weighs twice as
          much as the box.

          The applet adds force vectors to the image of the
          box-table-earth system, as in the preceding illustration.  A
          force vector is placed so that its tail end is located at
          the point where the force is acting.
        </p>

			 Note that gravitational forces are distributed forces that
          act on all parts of an extended object and that can be
          replaced by a single effective force acting at the center of
          the gravity of the object.  Thus gravitational forces
          exerted on the earth are represented by arrows that have
          their tail ends at the center of the earth.  See the upward
          pointing arrow representing the gravitational force exerted
          by the table on the earth in the preceding illustration.
        </p>
		  <p>
			 The center of gravity of the table is assumed to be just
          slightly below the table platform (the table's legs have
          weight too and cause the center of gravity of the table to
          be below the table's platform), and this is where the applet
          places the tail end of the arrow representing the
          gravitational force exerted by the earth on the table.  See
          the green arrow in the preceding illustration.
		  </p>
		  <p>
          The normal force exerted by the earth on the table consists
          of four separate forces acting on the four legs of the table
          and is represented accordingly.  Similarly, the reaction
          force to this force.  It is represented by four forces
          acting on the earth.

          For a each mode, a framed text in the top left corner of the
          applet window indicates what you are expected to do in that
          mode.  For details on the different modes, see Point 4 above.
