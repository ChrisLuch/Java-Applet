<br>

<div class="sectionheading">
      The applet shows forces and the corresponding reaction forces
      acting on the parts of a system consisting of a box that is
      resting on a table which in turn is resting on the earth.

<p>
  The applet deals with forces exerted on the three parts of a system
  consisting of a box, a table, and the earth.  Only forces exerted by
  the three parts of the system on each other are considered.  
</p>
<p>
  Forces exerted on a part of the system by objects outside the system
  are ignored, e.g., the forces exerted by the air on either the box
  or the table.  Thus, forces of buoyancy are ignored.  This is
  possible because these forces are small in comparison to the forces
  that <b>are</b> being included.
</p>
<p>
  In representing the various forces by arrows of certain lengths, the
  applet assumes that the table's weight is twice that of the box.
