<div class="title">Help - Skaters and Blocks</div>

<p><div class="sectionheading">The applet shows two skaters pushing
off from each other or, alternatively, two blocks that are being
forced apart.  The applet demonstrates the resulting momenta, speeds,
and kinetic energies of the two skaters or blocks.</div>




<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p>It is assumed that the surfaces on which the blocks slide or the
ice on which the skaters slide exert a negligible amount of friction
on the sliding objects.  This way, there is no net external force
acting on the two systems.

<p>It is assumed that the mass of the expanding gas in the explosion
forcing the two blocks apart is negligible.  Otherwise, the momentum of
the gas cloud might not be zero, causing the momenta of the two blocks
to have unequal magnitudes.
