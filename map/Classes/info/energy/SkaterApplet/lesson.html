      <b>Definition of Momentum</b>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The <i>momentum</i> of a particle of mass <i>m</i> and
      velocity <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> is defined as the
      product 
      <p align="center">
        <img src="p.gif" alt="vector p" align="top"> = <i>m</i>

           (1)
      </p>
      <p>
        As the definition implies, momentum is a vector quantity.
        It is denoted by the symbol <img src="p.gif" alt="vector p"
        align="absbottom">. The momentum vector points in the same
        direction as the velocity vector.

      <p>
        The (total) momentum <img src="Pcap.gif" alt="vector P"
        align="top"> of a system of particles, denoted by a capital
        <i>P</i> with arrow, is defined as the vector sum of the

      <b>Law of Momentum Conservation</b>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <u>Version A</u>. The total momentum of an isolated system of
      particles is conserved. 
      <p>
        <u>Version B</u>. The total momentum of a system of
        particles is conserved if the total external force acting
        on the system is zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>Comments</u>. Version A is a special case of Version B.
        If a system is isolated, i.e., not interacting with
        anything external to the system, the system does not
        experience any external forces whatsoever so that the sum
        of such forces is obviously zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Version B, the system does not have to be isolated but
        can be interacting with its environment. In this case, the
        total momentum of the system still is conserved, as long as
        the external forces add up to zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        The law of momentum conservation is a consequence of
        Newton's third law for systems to which the latter applies.
        Newton's third law says that the internal forces come in
        equal and opposite pairs. Such force pairs cause equal and
        opposite momentum changes for the particle pairs on which
        they act, thus causing zero overall momentum change.

      <b>Exercise 1 - Speed and Velocity</b>. Reset the applet. The
      masses of the skaters will be set to 60 kg (skater on the
      left) and 45 kg (skater on the right). Play the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this Exercise you will analyze a physically equivalent
      system in which the skaters are replaced by blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click Replay and Show Blocks. The two blocks are
      side-by-side. Record their <i>x</i>-coordinates
      <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, as well as the
      coordinate <i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> of the center of mass of the
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play the motion and pause it when block 1, the red one, is
      roughly at <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> = -1 m. You should see a
      display similar to that in Figure 1 below.

    </p>
    <p>
      Record the current positions of the two blocks and the time
      <i>t</i> elapsed. Then calculate the speeds of the two blocks
      from the data recorded. Let's assume for the moment that the
      speeds are constant, so that one can find the instantaneous
      speeds by calculating the average speeds over the entire time
      interval elapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The data for block 1 (red) as shown in Figure
      1 and as recorded at <i>t</i> = 0 are as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <u><i>t</i> = 0</u>: <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> = -0.25 m
    </p>
    <p>
      <u><i>t</i> = 3.60 s</u>: <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> = -1.08 m
    </p>
    <p>
      From the definition of speed, distance traveled divided by
      time elapsed, the speed <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> of block 1 is
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> = |-1.08 - (-0.25)| / 3.60 = 0.23 m/s.
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="50"> (3)
    </p>
    <p>
      Compare this with the value of <i>v</i><sub>1</sub> shown in
      the data box for block 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, for block 2,
    </p>
    <p>
      <u><i>t</i> = 0</u>: <i>x</i><sub>2</sub> = 0.25 m
    </p>
    <p>
      <u><i>t</i> = 3.60 s</u>: <i>x</i><sub>2</sub> = 1.36 m
    </p>
    <p>
      From the definition of speed, distance traveled divided by
      time elapsed, the speed <i>v</i><sub>2</sub> of block 2
      (green) is
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>v</i><sub>2</sub> = |1.36 - 0.25| / 3.60 = 0.31 m/s.
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="50"> (4)
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the velocities, the simulation shows that they are in
      opposite directions. Thus their <i>x</i>-components, with the
      <i>x</i>-axis horizontal and pointing to the right, are
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment</u>. You may want to continue the motion and pause
      it again when the blocks are farther apart. Again calculate
      the average speeds of the two blocks over the entire time
      interval from the beginning and verify that you get the same
      values as before, thus verifying that the speeds are
      constant.

      <b>Exercise 2 - Momentum</b>. From the results of Exercise 1

      The values in the data boxes are consistent with these
      values, to within the precision available from the position
      values.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnitudes of the two momenta are equal. Since the
      momenta are in opposite directions, like the velocities, the
      vector sum of the two momenta at <i>t</i> = 1.11 s is zero.
      According to the law of momentum conservation, this is as it
      should be because initially the total momentum of the
      two-block system (or the two-skater system) is clearly zero
      when both objects are at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question</b>. Why should the total momentum of this system
      be conserved?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The two-block system is <b>not</b> isolated
      because the blocks must be assumed to be sliding on some
      supporting surfaces that exert upward normal forces on the
      blocks. The skaters obviously are sliding on ice. The normal
      forces are opposite to the downward gravitational forces
      exerted on the blocks or skaters by the earth. These two
      kinds of forces add up to zero because these objects are not
      accelerating in the vertical direction. Thus, the total
      external force acting on the system in the vertical direction
      is zero. The system is assumed to be frictionless so the
      exertenal horizontal forces acting on it are zero as well.
      Thus, the total <b>external</b> force acting on the system is
      zero and Version B of the Law of Momentum Conservation
      applies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the forces due to the initial push that the skaters
      exert on each other or due to the explosion between the
      blocks are <b>internal</b> forces, which do not need to be
      considered in the Law of Momentum Conservation. (It is
      assumed here that the exploding material in the case of the
      blocks is part of that system and that the exploding material
      has negligible mass so that it cannot take up any momentum.)

      <b>Exercise 3 - Kinetic Energy</b>. From the results of
      Exercise 1 or Exercise 2 and the given masses, calculate the
      kinetic energies of the two blocks at <i>t</i> = 3.60 s.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Calculation 1</u>. The kinetic energy <i>KE</i> of a
      particle of mass <i>m</i> and speed <i>v</i> is defined as
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>KE</i> = (<i>m</i>/2) <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> . <img src=
      "small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="50"> (8)
    </p>
    <p>
      Substituting the data from Figure 1 into this definition
      gives for the kinetic energy of Block 1, within the precision
      afforded by the speed data, the value
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>KE</i><sub>1</sub> = (<i>m</i><sub>1</sub>/2)
      <i>v</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> = 60/2&#215;0.23<sup>2</sup>
      = 1.6 J . <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
         width="50"> (9)
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, for Block 2,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>KE</i><sub>2</sub> = (<i>m</i><sub>2</sub>/2)
      <i>v</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> = 45/2&#215;0.31<sup>2</sup>
      = 2.2 J . <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
         width="50"> (10)
    </p>
    <p>
      The values in the data boxes are consistent with these
      values, to within the precision available from the speed
      values.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Calculation 2</u>. The kinetic energy of a particle can
      also be calculated from the mass and magnitude <i>p</i> of
      momentum of the particle. The equation is
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>KE</i> = <i>p</i><sup>2</sup> / 2<i>m</i>. <img src=
      "small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="50"> (11)
    </p>
    <p>
      Verify, by substituting <i>p</i> = <i>mv</i> into Expression
      (11) for <i>KE</i>, that this expression is consistent with
      Expression (8).
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the given values for the masses and the values for the
      momenta from the data boxes, yields
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>KE</i><sub>1</sub> = 13.89<sup>2</sup>/(2&#215;60) = 1.61
      J <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="20"> and
      <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="20">
      <i>KE</i><sub>2</sub> = 13.89<sup>2</sup>/(2&#215;45) = 2.14
      J . <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="50">
      (12)
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the higher precision of the momentum values, these
      results agree with the values for the kinetic energies in the
      data boxes to within the number of significant digits.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. Which block has the greater kinetic
      energy, and by what factor, the smaller block or the larger
      block?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. As the last two calculations show, the block
      with the smaller mass has the larger kinetic energy. This can
      be understood as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since both blocks have the same magnitude of momentum, and
      since magnitude of momentum equals mass times speed, smaller
      mass implies larger speed. By Equation (8), kinetic energy is
      proportional to the <b>second</b> power of the speed and only
      to the <b>first</b> power of the mass. Therefore, an increase
      in kinetic energy due to an increase in speed is greater than
      the decrease in kinetic energy due to the corresponding
      decrease in mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to understand this result is to look at
      Expression (11). Momentum conservation implies that both
      blocks have momenta of equal magnitude if both blocks start
      from rest. With both blocks having the same magnitude
      <i>p</i> of momentum, the numerators in Expression (11) are
      equal for both blocks and only the denominators are
      different. Since the mass is in the denominator, the kinetic
      energy of a block is inversely proportional to its mass. The
      greater the mass, the smaller the kinetic energy. In symbols,
      this is
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>KE</i><sub>1</sub> / <i>KE</i><sub>2</sub> =
      [<i>p</i><sup>2</sup> / 2<i>m</i><sub>1</sub>] /
      [<i>p</i><sup>2</sup> / 2<i>m</i><sub>2</sub>] =
      <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> / <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> . <img src=
      "small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="50"> (13)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. Suppose we have the following data:
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Block 1</u>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> = 90 kg
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>KE</i><sub>1</sub> = 2.0 J
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <u>Block 2</u>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> = 60 kg
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>KE</i><sub>2</sub> = ?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What is the kinetic energy of Block 2?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> / <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> =
      90/60 = 3/2. Therefore, by Equation (13),
      <i>KE</i><sub>2</sub> / <i>KE</i><sub>1</sub> =
      <i>KE</i><sub>2</sub> / 2.0 = 3/2. This implies
      <i>KE</i><sub>2</sub> = 3.0 J.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 3</b>. Somebody throws a ball straight into the
      air. The kinetic energy of the ball decreases when the ball
      rises and increases when the ball falls, because of the
      gravitational interaction between the ball and the earth.
      What can you say about the corresponding changes in the
      kinetic energy of the earth?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The earth and the ball are a two-body system
      like the two-block system in the present applet. While the
      ball rises and falls, the kinetic energy changes in the earth
      are totally negligible, by Equation (13), because the mass of
      the earth is huge in comparison to that of the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      But note that the momentum changes of the earth have the same
      magnitude as those of the ball, by momentum conservation
      applied to the ball-earth system.

      Are these values consistent with <i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> =
      -0.04 m if the masses of blocks 1 and 2 are 60 kg and 45 kg,
      respectively?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The CM of a two-particle system is at a
      position such that the ratio of the distances from the CM to
      the two particles is equal to the reciprocal of the ratio of
      the two masses. Expressed in the form of an equation, this
      says that

      Values (16) and (17) are consistent within the precision of
      the given position values. Compare the following calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Task</b>. Solve Equation (15) for <i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> in
      terms of the other quantities in that equation. The result
      will be an equation that lets you calculate the position
      <i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> of the CM if you know the positions of
      the other two particles and their masses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Eliminate the denominators in Equation (15) by
      multiplying both sides of the equation with
      <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> [<i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> -
      <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>]. Then canceling common factors in the
      numerators and denominators gives

    <p>
      Multiplying out the brackets, collecting the terms with
      <i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> on the left-hand side, the other terms
      on the right-hand side, and multiplying both sides by -1,
      gives
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> (<i>m</i><sub>1</sub> +

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 3</b>. If the given values are substituted into
      the right-hand side of Equation (20), what value does one get
      for the position of the CM?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> = [60&#215;(-1.08) + 45&#215;1.36] /
      (60 + 45) = -0.034 m .<img src="small.gif" alt="space"
         height="1" width="50"> (21)
    </p>
    <p>
      Rounding this result to two decimals gives
      <i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> = -0.03 m. This differs in the last
      decimal from the value <i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> = -0.04 m
      displayed by the applet. The explanation is that the applet
      calculates <i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> from more exact position
      values than the rounded values of <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> and
      <i>x</i><sub>2</sub> that the applet displays. Within the
      precision afforded by the number of significant figures
      available to us, the values of <i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> just
      calculated and the value displayed by the applet are
      consistent.

      <b>Question 4</b>. The total momentum <img src="Pcap.gif"

      the velocity <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
      align="top"><sub>CM</sub> of the CM is zero.  Is there a
      connection between the total momentum and the velocity of the
      CM? What would this connection be if the total momentum were not
      zero?
    </p>
    <p>
      You can try to find an answer to these questions by working
      out some examples with numbers, but a more conclusive answer
      requires the use of symbols. Such an answer will now be
      given, but you may want to try to find your own answer before
      reading on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. In the following equations, we will work with
      <i>x</i>-components of velocities and momenta, but refer to
      these as "velocities" and "momenta" for the sake of brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We start with Equation (19). This equation is true at every
      instant of time, with values of <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>,
      <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, and <i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> that in
      general are different at different instants. (In the present
      applet, only <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>
      depend on time.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Write down Equation (19) twice, first for position values at
      time <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and then for position values at
      time <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, and subtract the two left-hand
      sides from each other and the right-hand sides from eachh
      other. This leads to the following equation
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      (<i>m</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>) <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>x</i><sub>CM</sub> = <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>
      <font face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i><sub>1</sub> +
      <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>x</i><sub>2</sub> <img src="small.gif"
      alt="space" height="1" width="50"> (22)
    </p>
    <p>
      where <font face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i><sub>CM</sub>
      denotes the change in the CM position during the time
      interval from <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> to <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>,
      and similarly <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>x</i><sub>1</sub> and <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>x</i><sub>2</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dividing both sides of this equation by the time elapsed,
      <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> = <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> -
      <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, gives
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    </p>
    <p>
      The ratios <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>x</i><sub>CM</sub>/<font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>t</i>, etc., are equal to the velocities
      <i>v</i><sub>x,CM</sub>, etc. Thus,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      (<i>m</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>)
      <i>v</i><sub>x,CM</sub> = <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>
      <i>v</i><sub>x1</sub> + <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>
      <i>v</i><sub>x2</sub> = <i>p</i><sub>x1</sub> +
      <i>p</i><sub>x2</sub>. <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="50"> (24)
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last step, the products <i>mv</i><sub>x</sub> have
      been replaced by the momenta <i>p</i><sub>x</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The total momentum <i>P</i><sub>x</sub> of the two-block
      system, by Definition (2), is equal to the sum of the momenta
      of the two blocks,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>P</i><sub>x</sub> = <i>p</i><sub>x1</sub> +
      <i>p</i><sub>x2</sub>. <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="50"> (25)
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the right-hand sides of Equations (24) and (25) are
      equal, the left-hand sides must be equal as well. This gives
      us the sought-for connection between the total momentum and
      the velocity of the CM,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>P</i><sub>x</sub> = (<i>m</i><sub>1</sub> +
      <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>) <i>v</i><sub>x,CM</sub> = <i>M</i>
      <i>v</i><sub>x,CM</sub>, <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="20"> <i>M</i> = <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> +
      <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>. <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
         height="1" width="50"> (26)
    </p>
    <p>
      where <i>M</i> is the total mass of the two-block system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equation (26), in words, says that the total momentum of the
      two-block system is equal to the total mass times the
      velocity of the center of mass of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      This equation actually is true for any system with any number
      of particles. The particles may be moving in any directions
      in three-dimensional space, not just along an <i>x</i>-axis.
      In this case, the equation must be written in vector form,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="Pcap.gif" alt="vector P" align="top"> = <i>M</i>
      <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="top"><sub>CM</sub> . <img src=
      "small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="50"> (27)
    </p>
    <p>
      Either Equation (26) or (27) implies that the if the velocity
      of the CM is zero then so is the total momentum, and vice
      versa. And if either the total momentum or the velocity of
      the CM is not zero, then neither is the other quantity. The
      two quantities are proportional to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Practice</b>. Suppose the following data are given.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Block 1</u>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>m</i><sub>1</sub> = 90 kg
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>v</i><sub>x1</sub> = -2.0 m/s
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <u>Block 2</u>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>m</i><sub>2</sub> = 60 kg
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>v</i><sub>x2</sub> = 1.5 m/s
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Use Equation (25) to work out the total momentum of the
      system. Then use Equation (26) to work out the velocity of
      the CM of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer should be <i>v</i><sub>x,CM</sub> = -0.60 m/s.
