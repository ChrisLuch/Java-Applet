<p><b>Instructions</b>

<p>This page is designed to get you started using the applet. The
applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on this page are
to be done in the applet. You may need to toggle back and forth
between instructions and applet if your screen space is
limited.

  <p>When the applet is freshly loaded, the display of red and blue
  blocks looks like that in Figure 1 below, without the arrows.  There
  are 13 red blocks, representing 13 J of kinetic energy, and 12 blue
  blocks, representing 12 J of potential energy.

  <p align="center"><img src="energyblocksinitial.jpg"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

  <p>Move the second blue block (by clicking on it and dragging) from
  the first column to the point indicated by the black arrow, and do
  likewise for the red block in the bottom right corner.  Double-click
  on the latter block once you have moved it.  The result should look
  like that in Figure 2 below.

  <p align="center"><img src="energyblocks.jpg"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

  <p>The tally below the white system window says that there are 12J
  of kinetic and 13 J of potential energy.

  <p><b>Exercise</b>.  Change the distribution of potential and
  kinetic energy in the system so that there is 10 J of kinetic energy
  and 15 J of potential energy.

<p><div class="sectionheading"><a name = "EnergyChange">Changing the
Amount of Energy of the System</a></div>

  <p>There are 25 J of energy in the system initially, distributed
  over potential and kinetic energy, and there are 21 J of energy
  outside the system.  The latter is represented by green blocks.

  <p>Start from the energy distribution shown in Figure 2.  Drag one
  of the two blocks that you moved earlier outside of the system.
  Then do the same with the other block.  Notice that the color of the
  blocks changes to green as they leave the system, which symbolizes
  that the energy gets converted to another form, e.g., chemical
  energy.  The total number of blocks inside and outside the system,
  i.e., the total energy, remains the same.

  <p>There should now be 12 J of kinetic energy and 11 J of potential
  energy in the system and 23 J of energy outside the system, for an
  unchanged total of 46 J.

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 3</b></p>

  <p><b>Exercise</b>. By moving and converting blocks, create a
  distribution of energies where there are 19 J of energy outside the
  system, and 15 J of kinetic energy and 12 J of potential energy
  inside the system.
