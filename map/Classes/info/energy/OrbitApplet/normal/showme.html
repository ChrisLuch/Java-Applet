      The applet simulates the motion of two stars revolving around
      each other, the gravitational forces exerted by the stars on
      each other, the stars' momenta and velocities, and the
      kinetic and potential energies of the system.

      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This page is designed to get you started using the applet.
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on
      this page are to be done in the applet. You may need to
      toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if your
      screen space is limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure you know Eqs.(1) and (2) from Assumptions on the
      menu above when working through the first two sections.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset"
      align="top"> the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the force vectors by selecting the Vectors button
      <img src="Vectors.gif" alt="Vectors Button" align="top"> and
      checking "Gravitational Forces" in the vector panel that
      opens up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag the stars into a configuration similar to that shown in
      Figure 1 below.

       <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag the ruler so that one end coincides with the center of
      one star. Then drag the ruler's other end so that it
      coincides with the center of the other star. Adjust the
      positions of the stars so that the ruler measures about 277,
      as in Figure 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Observe the gravitational forces (green
      arrows) that the stars exert on each other. The forces are
      oppositely directed and have equal magnitude. Measure the
      common magnitude <i>F</i> (length of the arrows representing
      the forces) by means of the ruler. For the configuration in
      Figure 1, <i>F</i> is close to 60.
    </p>
    <p>
      Move the stars apart until their distance is twice that it
      was before, to approximately 574. Based on Eq.(1) from
      Assumptions, what do you expect the magnitude of the forces
      to be now? Measure the magnitude with the ruler and check
      your prediction. (It should be around 15. Because of the
      imprecision in lining up the ruler's endpoints exactly, there
      may be some error in the value you measure.)

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Use the ruler to set the
      center-to-center distance between the stars to 250, or as
      close to this value as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Record the value of the binary-star system's potential energy
      <i>PE</i> displayed in the bottom left corner of the applet
      window. It should be close to -1.68. You can obtain the
      <i>PE</i> value also, but not to the same accuracy, from
      reading the position of the top of the blue potential energy
      column on the energy scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Change the position of the two stars so that their distance
      increases. The potential energy should increase also. (The
      top of the blue potential energy column should rise and the
      <i>PE</i> value should become less negative.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Move the stars apart until their distance
      is twice that it was before, approximately 500. Based on
      Eq.(2) from Assumptions, what do you expect the magnitude of
      the potential energy to be now? Measure the magnitude with
      the ruler, and check your prediction. It should be around
      -0.84. Because of the imprecision in lining up the ruler's
      endpoints exactly, there may be some error in the value you
      measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. RESET the applet. Drag the energy scale
      downward until the zero point of the scale is at the top of
      the blue potential energy column. The <i>PE</i> value
      displayed will be close to 0. Move the two stars apart until
      their center-to-center distance is 500 or very close to this
      value. What value do you expect the potential energy to have
      now? It should be close to +0.84. Why?

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Display the velocity
      vectors of the two stars, but no other vectors. (In the
      applet's default state, all three kinds of vectors are
      displayed.) Select the Vectors button, and uncheck "Momenta"
      and "Gravitational Forces" in the vector panel that pops up.
      Close the vector panel by deselecting the Vectors button,
      pressing it a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that the velocities of the two stars are opposite,
      but not of equal magnitude. See Figure 2 below. Drag the tip
      of one of the velocity vectors. The other one will adjust
      automatically so that the velocities are always opposite and
      so that their magnitudes have a constant ratio.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Measure the magnitude of the larger
      velocity vector with the ruler, and record the value of the
      system's kinetic energy <i>KE</i> displayed in the bottom
      left corner. Double the magnitude of the velocity vector by
      dragging the arrow. The kinetic energy is proportional to the
      square of the speed. What new <i>KE</i> value do you predict?
      The value should quadruple. Check if it does.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. For most initial velocities, the orbits of
      the two stars are elliptical. The orbits are circular if one
      sets the initial velocity vectors so that they are
      perpendicular to the line joining the stars and so that the
      kinetic energy is equal to half of the absolute value of the
      potential energy,

    <p align="center">
      <i>KE</i> = 0.5 |<i>PE</i>| .

    <p>
      This equation assumes that <i>PE</i> = 0 when <i>d</i> =
      <img src="infinity.gif" alt="infinity" align="bottom">, as in
      the applet's default state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust the initial velocities so that these conditions are
      met. Then PLAY the motion. You should obtain circular orbits
      as in Figure 2 above. Display the orbits by selecting the
      Trace button <img src="Trace.gif" alt="Traces" align="top">.

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Display the stars'
      momentum vectors, but not the velocity and force vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite
      in direction. Under this condition, the center of mass of the
      system is at rest during the motion. PLAY the motion and
      check if this is the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. REWIND <img src="Rewind.gif" alt="Rewind"
      align="top"> the applet. Display the stars' velocity vectors
      in addition to their momentum vectors. The velocity and
      momentum vectors are superimposed because they point in the
      same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Change the momentum vectors by dragging the tip of one of the
      <b>velocity</b> vectors. (The tips of the momentum vectors
      cannot be dragged.) Observe that the momentum vectors are
      always equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Thus,
      the total momentum of the system is always zero. The applet
      is designed this way, so that the center of mass is at rest
      during the motion for all available initial conditions.
