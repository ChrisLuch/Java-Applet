      The applet simulates the motion of two stars revolving around
      each other, the gravitational forces exerted by the stars on
      each other, the stars' momenta and velocities, and the
      kinetic and potential energies of the system.

        <p>
          Selecting the Vectors toggle button displays the vector
          panel illustrated above. By checking any of the three
          checkboxes in the panel, the corresponding vectors can be
          displayed. In the example above, the stars' velocities
          and the gravitational forces the stars are exerting on
          each other are checked. These vectors are shown in
          magenta and green, respectively, in the image below.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <img src="BinaryStarVectors.gif" alt="Vectors">
        </p>
        <p>
          The following vectors can be displayed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>Velocities</u>: velocity vectors of the two stars;
            color: magenta. 
            <p>
              Upon REWIND or RESET, the velocities can be adjusted
              by clicking on the tip of the velocity vector of
              either star and dragging. Observe how the mouse
              cursor changes to a cross-hair cursor when near the
              tip of a velocity vector. At this time, the tip can
              be dragged.
            </p>
            <p>
              When one velocity vector is adjusted, the other one
              is adjusted by the applet automatically so that the
              total momentum of the system remains zero. This way,
              the center of mass of the system remains at rest
              during the motion.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Momenta</u>: momentum vectors of the two stars;
            color: blue. 
            <p>
              The momentum vectors cannot be adjusted directly.
              They can be adjusted indirectly by adjusting the
              velocity vectors. See above.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Gravitational Forces</u>: the gravitational forces
            the stars exert on each other; color: green. 
            <p>
              The gravitational force vectors are determined by the
              stars' positions and cannot be adjusted directly.
              Adjusting the stars' positions does have an effect on
              the gravitational force vectors. See Point 5 below.

        <p align="center">
          <img src="BinaryStarEnergy.gif" alt="Energy Column">
        </p>
        <p>
          On the left-hand side of the applet window, a column is
          displayed showing the potential energy (blue) and kinetic
          energy (red) of the binary star system.
        </p>
        <p>
          An energy scale in unspecified units is placed next to
          the energy column. The corresponding values of the
          kinetic energy, <i>KE</i>, and potential energy,
          <i>PE</i>, are shown at the bottom left of the window. By
          projecting the top level of the blue potential energy bar
          onto the scale, you can read the value of the potential
          energy on the scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you move the mouse cursor onto the scale, the cursor
          changes into a pointing hand. At this time, you can click
          on the scale and drag it either upward or downward. The
          effect is to change the potential energy by an additive
          constant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The horizontal grey line indicated by the label
          "<i>PE</i> at <i>d</i> = <img src="infinity.gif" alt=
          "infinity" align="bottom">" indicates the position of the
          top of the potential energy bar when the two stars are
          infinitely far apart. It is customary to define the
          potential energy to be zero when the stars are infinitely
          far apart, and this is done in the applet's default
          setting and is the case in the image above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kinetic and potential energies shown are the totals
          for the two-star system. The kinetic energy shown is the
          sum of the individual kinetic energies of the stars. (The
          individual kinetic energies are not displayed.) In
          contrast to the kinetic energy, the potential energy
          cannot be written as a sum of potential energies
          belonging to either star alone.

          By clicking on either star and dragging, you can adjust
          the initial positions of the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          This way, you can observe the changes in the potential
          energy of the system corresponding to changes in the
          star's positions and, if you display the force vectors,
          the changes in the gravitational forces the stars exert
          on each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The center of mass of the binary star system is indicated
          by a small red circle labeled "cm". You can observe the
          changes in the position of the center of mass
          accompanying changes in the stars' positions.
