      Assumptions - Binary Star System

      The applet simulates the motion of two stars revolving around
      each other, the gravitational forces exerted by the stars on
      each other, the stars' momenta and velocities, and the
      kinetic and potential energies of the system.

        <p>
          The two stars are assumed to be spheres of uniform mass
          density. With this assumption, the magnitude <i>F</i> of
          the gravitational force that either star exerts on the
          other is given by
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <i>F</i> = <i>Gm<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub></i> /
          <i>d</i><sup>2</sup> <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
          height="1" width="40">(1)
        </p>
        <p>
          where <i>G</i> is the universal gravitational constant,
          <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> are the
          masses of the two stars, and <i>d</i> is the
          center-to-center distance between the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          The potential energy <i>PE</i> of the two-star system
          corresponding to this force is given by
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <i>PE</i> = -<i>Gm<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub></i> /
          <i>d</i> + const. <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
             height="1" width="40">(2)
        </p>
        <p>
          The additive constant in this expression can be chosen to
          have any value. It is customary to set it equal to zero
          so that <i>PE</i> = 0 when the two stars are infinitely
          far apart. This is the choice made in the applet's
          default state.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It is assumed that no forces are acting on the stars
          other than the gravitational forces exerted by the stars
          on each other.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          All values displayed by the applet are in dimensionless
          units because no explicit values for the masses of the
          stars and the distances are assumed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The stars are assumed not to be rotating about an
          internal axis so that the kinetic energy of the system is
          the sum of only the translational kinetic energies of the
          stars, effectively treating the stars as mass points.
