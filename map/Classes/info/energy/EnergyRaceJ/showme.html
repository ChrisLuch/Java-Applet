      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This page is designed to get you started using the applet.
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on
      this page are to be done in the applet. You may need to
      toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if your
      screen space is limited.

    <p>
      On the left incline, select the hoop and on the right incline
      the sphere. Click the Friction buttons under each incline, so
      that each incline has friction. Figure 1 below shows what you
      should be able to see.

      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the hoop and the sphere each have 64 J of gravitational
      potential energy, represented by 64 blue squares each, and no
      kinetic energy. The zero of the potential energy is at the
      bottom of the incline. So when an object makes it to the
      bottom of the incline, there should be no blue squares left
      for that object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verify this by clicking Play <img src="Play.gif" alt="Play"
      align="top"> and letting the motion continue until both
      objects have moved past the finish line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then click Rewind <img src="Rewind.gif" alt="Rewind"
         align="top"> and click Play again. Which object wins the
         race?
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that a small flag <img src="raceflag.jpg" alt="Flag"
      align="top"> is raised at the finish line that is crossed
      first, and that the color of either finish line changes from
      blue to green when an object passes the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click Rewind. Deselect the Friction checkbox for the left
      incline with the hoop, so that the incline is now
      frictionless. Don't change anything on the right incline.
      Play the motion again. Which object wins the race this time?
    </p>
    <p>
      Click Rewind, and Play the motion once more. Observe the
      yellow dots painted on the hoop and sphere as the objects
      move down the incline. Which of the two objects is rolling,
      which one sliding down the incline?
    </p>

    <div class="sectionheading">
      <a name="Energy">Observing Energy Changes During a Race</a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Click Rewind. The left incline should be frictionless and
      have the hoop on it, and the right incline should have
      friction and have the sphere on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have another look at Figure 1 above or at the applet. The
      applet displays three kinds of energy: potential energy
      (<i>PE</i>), translational kinetic energy (<i>TK</i>), and
      rotational kinetic energy (<i>RK</i>). These are color-coded
      blue, red, and magenta, respectively. The amounts of each
      kind of energy for each of the two incline-systems are
      displayed in the grey area above the inclines in 1-J chunks,
      represented by colored blocks. At the start, all energy
      blocks are blue (<i>PE</i>) because all kinetic energies are
      zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play the motion and then click Pause <img src="Pause.gif"
         alt="Pause" align="top"> before the hoop reaches the
         finish line. You should something like Figure 2 below.

      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the hoop, which is sliding and not rolling, has
      most of its potential energy converted into translational
      kinetic energy and no rotational kinetic energy at all. The
      sphere, however, which is rolling and has not moved as far as
      the sliding hoop, has less potential energy converted into
      kinetic energy, and the kinetic energy is now split into
      translational and rotational parts. There is more
      translational than rotational kinetic energy.
