   <div class="title">Assumptions - Energy Race</div>

<p><div class="sectionheading">The applet simulates a race between two
objects rolling or sliding down two inclines with or without
friction</div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p>All objects in the applet have the same mass <i>m</i>.  The three
rolling objects, hoop, disk, and sphere, all have the same radius
<i>r</i>.

<p>There is no dissipative friction between the objects and the
incline.  The applet does allow friction to affect the motion of the
three round objects, but this friction does not reduce the mechanical
energy of the objects.

<p>The applet shows the energies in 1-J chunks.  In reality, as the
objects move down the inclines, the various energies change
continuously.
