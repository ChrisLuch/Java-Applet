    <p>
      Students will develop an understanding of the transformation
      of potential energy into translational and rotational kinetic
      energy when objects are rolling or sliding down an incline
      and how this transformation affects the speed with which the
      objects move down the incline.

      Underlying this Lesson is the law of mechanical energy
      conservation. Mechanical energy is defined as follows.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <b>Definition</b>. The sum of the potential, translational
      kinetic and rotational kinetic energies of a system is called
      the <i>mechanical energy</i> of the system. Let's denote the
      mechanical energy by <i>ME</i>. Thus, 
      <p align="center">
        <i>ME</i> = <i>PE</i> + <i>TK</i> + <i>RK</i> .
           <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40">
           (1)
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      One of the most general principles in physics is the
      principle of energy conservation. The law of mechanical
      energy conservation is a special case of this principle.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <b>Law of Mechanical Energy Conservation</b>. The energy of a
      closed mechanical system is conserved.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 1</u>. The energy of a mechanical system is
      mechanical energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A "mechanical system" is a system describable by the laws of
      mechanics. In particular, thermal properties do not need to
      be considered for such a system, and there is no internal
      dissipative friction leading to a transformation of
      mechanical into thermal energy of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 2</u>. A "closed" system is one that is not
      interacting with anything outside the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will take our system to consist of the object on the
      incline, the incline itself, and the entire earth and will
      assume that it is closed. The earth has to be part of the
      system because the moving object is interacting
      gravitationally with the earth. This interaction causes the
      object to accelerate down the incline. Also, the potential
      energy in the applet is the gravitational potential energy of
      the <b>object-earth pair</b>. For brevity's sake, one refers
      to this potential energy as the "potential energy of the
      object", but it is really the "potential energy of the
      object-earth pair".
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 3</u>. The inclines in the applet have friction,
      but not dissipative friction. Dissipative friction is
      friction that transforms mechanical energy into thermal
      energy. Friction, but not dissipative friction, is necessary
      for objects to roll rather than just slide down an incline.
      The friction that makes an object roll does not do work on
      the object and therefore does not lead to a loss in the
      object's mechanical energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality, there is always at least a small amount of
      dissipative friction present when an object is rolling. This
      small amount is neglected in the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 4</u>. In the system consisting of the moving
      object, the incline, and the earth, the object's kinetic
      energy is an important part of the mechanical energy of the
      system. However, there is no contribution from the earth's
      kinetic energy. Why not? Would this energy not be huge? The
      answer is "no" when we are working in a Lab frame rigidly
      attached to the earth.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Reset <img src="Reset.gif" alt="Reset" align="top"> the
      applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left incline, select the hoop and on the right incline
      the disk. Click the Friction buttons under each incline, so
      that each incline has friction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which object, the hoop or the disk, will make it to the
      finish line first? Make a prediction, then test it with the
      applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Click Rewind <img src="Rewind.gif" alt="Rewind" align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much energy does either object have at the start?
    </p>
    <p>
      Play the motion. Pause it before either object reaches the
      finish line. You should be able to see energy distributions
      like those in Figure 1 below. Figure 1 also shows the
      elevation <i>y</i> of the bottom of the hoop above ground
      level. This is not displayed by the applet.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="EnergyRacehoopdisk.jpg" alt=
      "Race between Hoop and Disk">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      How much total energy does either object have now? Write down
      the values of the various energies, potential and
      translational and rotational kinetic, of either object.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each object separately, add these energies to get the
      object's total energy at this moment. How does the total
      energy of each object compare with that at the start? Is the
      law of mechanical energy conservation obeyed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Work out the ratio (<i>RK</i>) / (<i>TK</i>) for both the
      hoop and the disk. Theoretically, these ratios are simple
      numbers. However, because of round-off error because the
      applet is using integer energy values only, the ratios you
      find may deviate slightly from the theoretical values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which object has the smaller ratio (<i>RK</i>) / (<i>TK</i>)?
      Is this the faster object? If so, why?
    </p>
    <p>
      The last couple of questions have the following answer. The
      theoretical values for (<i>RK</i>) / (<i>TK</i>) for the hoop
      and disk are
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      hoop: (<i>RK</i>) / (<i>TK</i>) = 1.0 , <img src="small.gif"
      alt="space" height="1" width="40"> (2)
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      disk: (<i>RK</i>) / (<i>TK</i>) = 0.5 .<img src="small.gif"
      alt="space" height="1" width="40">(3)
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also want to try the sphere. Its theoretical value is
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      sphere: (<i>RK</i>) / (<i>TK</i>) = 0.4 .<img src="small.gif"
      alt="space" height="1" width="40">(4)
    </p>
    <p>
      The translational kinetic energy of an object of mass
      <i>m</i> moving with speed <i>v</i> is given by
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>TK</i> = &frac12;<i>mv</i><sup>2</sup> .<img src=
      "small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40"> (5)
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore the more translational kinetic energy an object has
      the greater is its speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hoop and disk are at the same elevation <i>y</i>
      above the ground, they have the same potential energy. You
      can check this aproximately with the applet. (You will have
      to Play the applet twice, once stopping it when the hoop is
      at the given <i>y</i> and the other time stopping it when the
      disk is at this <i>y</i>.) Theoretically, the potential
      energy of an object of mass <i>m</i> at an elevation <i>y</i>
      above the ground is given by
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>PK</i> = <i>mgy</i> ,<img src="small.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40"> (6)
    </p>
    <p>
      where <i>g</i> is the magnitude of the acceleration due to
      gravity. All objects in the applet have the same mass
      <i>m</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, which object will be faster at a given elevation
      <i>y</i>? Since both of them have the same potential energy
      at this point and had the same potential energy at the start,
      the same amount of potential energy will have been converted
      into kinetic energy for either object. However, for the disk,
      less of this kinetic energy will have been converted into
      rotational and more into translational kinetic energy than
      for the hoop. Since the disk has more translational kinetic
      energy at any elevation, it will be faster everywhere and
      therefore will win the race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the rolling objects, which one is fastest: hoop, disk, or
      sphere? What would you predict on the basis of the ratios (2)
      to (4)? Test your prediction with the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Question on Equation (6)</u>. Consider the situation of
      the left incline in Figure 1 above. The potential energy at
      this instant is listed as 18 J. The potential energy at the
      beginning of the motion, which is also equal to the
      mechanical energy, is equal to 64 J. Are these two values
      consistent with Equation (6), considering the <i>y</i>-values
      at the instant shown in Figure 1 and at the start of the
      motion? This question can only be answered approximately by
      judging the the size of <i>y</i> shown in Figure 1 and the
      size of <i>y</i> at the start.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click Reset. Put the hoop on the left incline and the disk on
      the right incline. This time leave the left incline
      frictionless, but do add friction to the right incline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which object do you predict will reach the finish line first?
      Test your prediction with the applet?
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you explain the outcome of the race in terms of the
      conversion of potential into translational and rotational
      kinetic energy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Click Rewind, and Play the motion once more. Observe the
      yellow dot on the hoop. Is the hoop rolling or sliding down
      the incline?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you Pause the motion before the hoop reaches the finish
      line, you should be able to observe a distribution of
      energies similar to those in Figure 2 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="EnergyRacenofriction.jpg" alt=

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The hoop has no rotational kinetic energy at all because it
      is sliding, not rolling. Therefore, at a given elevation
      <i>y</i>, the hoop will clearly have more translational
      kinetic energy than the disk and therefore be faster and win
      the race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click Rewind, and make the second incline, which has the disk
      on it, frictionless also. Race the hoop against the disk,
      both without friction. Predict which one will win the race.
      Then replace the hoop with the brick.

      <a name="Rotational">Rotational Kinetic Energy</a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Rotational kinetic energy is analogous to translational
      kinetic energy, and so are the formal expressions for the two
      kinds of kinetic energy. Both involve a factor measuring the
      inertia of an object and a factor related to how fast the
      object's motion is.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of translational motion:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      the mass measures an object's inertial resistance to being
      translated and the speed measures how fast the object is
      translating.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the case of rotational motion:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      the moment of inertia measures an object's inertial
      resistance to being rotated and the angular speed measures
      how fast the object is rotating.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      To obtain the expression for rotational kinetic energy, start
      with Expression (5) for translational kinetic energy and
      replace the mass <i>m</i> by the moment of inertia
         <font face="symbol"><i>I</i></font> and the speed <i>v</i>

      There is a review of angular speed in the Appendix titled

      The quantities needed are listed below and are illustrated in
      Figure A1. The Figure shows a green dot which represents a
      particle or point on a rotating object. The particle is
      assumed to be moving in a circle. If we need to deal with a
      rolling object, we must imagine the circle to be co-moving
      with the object and the following considerations to be in the
      reference frame in which the center of the rolling object is
      at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle in which the particle or point on a rotating
      object is moving is thinly outlined. The center C of the
      circle is the vertex of the angle to be measured. We will
      refer to the vector from C to the particle as the <i>radius
      vector</i>. Its magnitude, i.e., the radius of the circle, is

      The <i>angular speed at a given instant</i>, <font face=
      "symbol">w</font>, is the limit of the average angular speed
      as <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> goes to zero, where
      the time interval over which the average angular speed is
      calculated contains the given instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is customary when dealing with angular speed to measure
      angles in radians. The SI-unit of angular velocity is rad/s.

    <p>
      By substituting Expression (A1) for <font face=
      "symbol">Dq</font> into Equation (A2) and then using
      Definition (A3), one obtains for the average angular speed

      This is a very useful relation. When solved for

      An equation analogous to (A5) applies for the (instantaneous)

      So far, everything has been in the frame of reference in
      which the center C of the circle is at rest. The speed
      <i>v</i> in Equation (A6) has been the speed of a point on a
      circle of radius <i>r</i>, and this point has been moving
      with angular speed <font face="symbol">w</font> around point
      C.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Equation (A6) also can be applied to a rolling
      object. In this case, <i>v</i> can be interpreted as the
      speed of the center C of the rolling object relative to the
      Lab frame while <font face="symbol">w</font> is the same
      angular speed of rotation as before. The reason why Equation
      (A6) can be interpreted this way is as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we have a rolling disk. Imagine a tape to be wound
      around the perimeter of the disk. This tape unrolls as the
      disk rolls along. A length of tape equal to the disk's
      circumference will unroll as the disk makes one revolution,
      and this is how far the center of the disk moves forward at
      the same time. More generally, during a time interval
      <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> in which a point on the
      perimeter of the disk moves a distance <i>s</i> from P to P'
      (see Figure A1) in the frame in which C is at rest, the
      center C moves forward an equal distance <i>s</i> relative to
      the Lab frame. Dividing by <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>t</i>, this implies that the speed of the
      point on the perimeter of the disk relative to point C is
      equal to the speed of point C relative to the Lab frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equation (A6) when applied to a rolling object is the
      "no-slipping" condition because the equation was derived
      assuming pure rolling motion. At which point in the
      derivation was the assumption of rolling without slipping
      necessary?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise</b>. Verify that Equations (A5) and (A6) are
      correct dimensionally.
