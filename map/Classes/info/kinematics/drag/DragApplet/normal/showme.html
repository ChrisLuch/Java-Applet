<p>This page is designed to get you started using the applet. The
applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on this page are
to be done in the applet. You may need to toggle back and forth
between instructions and applet if your screen space is
limited.

<p><b>Exercise 1</b>. Press the Reset button <img src="Reset.gif"
alt="Reset" align="top">.  

<p>Figure 1 below shows the red ball at the origin of an
(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)-coordinate system, plus some related data.

<p align="center"><img src="AvVelocitystart.jpg"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

<p>The green dot at the center of the ball represents a zero
displacement of the ball.  In general, the applet shows the
displacement (green arrow) from the start of the motion to the moment
the motion is stopped.  The displacement is labeled <img src="d.gif"
align="bottom">, in boldface and with an arrow above the
<b>d</b> to indicate that displacement is a vector quantity.

<p>Select the Data button <img src="Data.gif" alt="Data" align="top">,
and write out the names and symbols of the various quantities
displayed, to get used to the notation.  Figure 1 displays these
items without the surrounding box frames.

<p>Under 'average speed':
<ul>

<li>the total distance <i>s</i> traveled,</li>

<li>the total time <i>t</i> elapsed,</li>

<li>the average speed <i>v<sub>av</sub></i> from the beginning
of the motion until the moment the motion is stopped.</li>

</ul>

<p>Under 'average velocity':
<ul>

<li>the displacement <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align="bottom"> =
&Delta;<img src="r.gif" align="bottom">,</li>

<li>the average velocity <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom"><sub>av</sub> from the beginning of the motion up to
the instant the motion is stopped.</li>

</ul>  

<p>The displacement is indicated in terms of its magnitude <i>d</i>
and direction angle &theta; relative to the positive <i>x</i>-axis in
the positive sense (counter-clockwise).

<p>Note that the average velocity is in the same direction as the
displacement, always.  Therefore, both have the same direction angle
&theta;.

<div class="sectionheading"><a name = "Initial">Initial
Position</a></div>

<p><b>Exercise 1</b>.  Press the Initial-Position button <img
src="InitPos.gif" alt="Initial Position" align="top">.  When the mouse
cursor is in the applet window it takes the form of a '+', suggesting
a pair of cross hairs.  The (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)-coordinates of the
point at the center of the cross hairs are displayed.  

<p>Move the cursor to (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (10.0,-15.0) m, and click
the mouse.  The ball is now fixed at this initial position.
Alternatively, click the mouse button when the cursor is at some other
point at first and then drag with the mouse to (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) =
(10.0,-15.0) m while keeping the mouse button pressed.  Try it both
ways, clicking RESET in between.

<p align="center"><img src="Displacementinitialpos.jpg"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

<p><b>Exercise 2</b>. You may find it easier to place the ball at
(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (10.0,-15.0) m if you first display the
coordinate grid.  Reset the applet, press the Grid toggle button <img
src="Grid.gif" alt="Grid" align="top">, and place the ball at
(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (10.0,-15.0) m. Figure 2 above shows what you
should see.

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<p>

<div class="sectionheading"><a name = "Time">Time Elapsed</a></div>

<p><b>Exercise 1</b>. Reset the applet, and position the ball wherever
you like.  Display the Data boxes.  Close the one titled 'average
velocity', by clicking the 'X' in the top right corner of the box, so
that only the one titled 'average speed' remains open.  Click on the
ball and keep the mouse button depressed. Observe the time <i>t</i>
elapsed increasing in the average-speed box.  Release the mouse
button, and observe that the clock stops.

<p><b>Exercise 2</b>. Press the mouse button a second time. The clock
resumes running.  Does it show the time elapsed from the moment you
pressed the mouse button the first time or from the moment when you
pressed it the second time?  Observe that the elapsed time does not
advance while the mouse button is not pressed.

<p>The clock shows the time elapsed from the moment the mouse button
is pressed first until the current instant, not including times when
the mouse button is released.

<p><b>Exercise 3</b>. Check if the elapsed time shown is real time.
It is <b>not</b>.

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"

<div class="sectionheading"><a name =
"AvVelocity">Average Velocity vs. Average Speed</a></div>

<p><b>Exercise 1</b>. With the initial position of the ball set at
(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>i</sub> = (10.0,-15.0) m, drag the ball to
near (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>f</sub> = (-20.0,-10.0) m along a curved
path, as in the snapshot in Figure 3 below.  The path is shown in blue
and the displacement vector <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d"
align="bottom"> in green.

<p>Display the initial and final position vectors, <img src="r.gif"
alt="vector r" align="bottom"><sub>i</sub> and <img src="r.gif"
alt="vector r" align="bottom"><sub>f</sub>, respectively, by clicking
the Position toggle button <img src="Position.gif" alt="Positions"
align="top">.  The final position vector <img src="r.gif" alt="vector
r" align="bottom"><sub>f</sub> is in blue, and the initial position
vector <img src="r.gif" align="bottom"><sub>i</sub> in dimmed blue.

<p align="center"><img src="AvVelocitycurved.jpg" alt="Displacement
Vector"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 3</b></p>

<p><b>Exercise 2</b>.  Figure 3 also shows data related to the motion
you produced with the applet.  Display these data by clicking the Data
toggle button <img src="Data.gif" alt="Data" align="top">.  (The
frames surrounding the data are not reproduced in Figure 3.)

<p>What are the values of the average speed <i>v<sub>av</sub></i> and
of the magnitude <nobr>|<img src="v.gif"
align="bottom"><sub>av</sub>|</nobr> of the average velocity in your
case?  In Figure 3, these values are <i>v<sub>av</sub></i> =
<i>s</i>/<i>t</i> = 7.7 m/s and <nobr>|<img src="v.gif"
align="bottom"><sub>av</sub>|</nobr> = <i>d</i>/<i>t</i> = 6.4 m/s,
respectively.

<p>Correspondingly, what values do you have for the distance traveled
<i>s</i> and the magnitude <i>d</i> of the displacement?  In Figure 3,
these are listed as 36.5 m and 30.4 m, respectively.  The time elapsed
is equal to 4.7 s.

<p><b>Exercise 3</b>.  What value does the direction angle &theta;
have for the average velocity and the displacement in your case?  Are
the two direction angles equal?  In the case of Figure 3, the value of
this common angle is &theta; = 170.5<sup>o</sup>.  This angle is
measured relative to the positive <i>x</i>-axis in the positive sense.

<p>Note that no direction angle is given for the average speed because
average speed is a scalar, not a vector quantity.

<p><b>Exercise 4</b>. With the ball still near
(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>f</sub> = (-20.0,-10.0) m, click on the ball
again, but do <b>not</b> drag it.  Observe how the elapsed time
advances and the values of the average speed and of the magnitude of
the average velocity keep on decreasing.

<p><b>Exercise 5</b>.  Repeat the observations in Exercises 2 to 4 by
returning the ball to the same intial position at
(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>i</sub> = (10.0,-15.0) m and then dragging it
elsewhere.  To return the ball to this position, click the REWIND
button <img src="Rewind.gif" alt="Rewind" align="top">.

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<div class="sectionheading"><a name =
"StraightLine">Straight-Line Motion</a></div>

<p><b>Exercise 1</b>. With the initial position of the ball at
(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>i</sub> = (10.0,-15.0) m, press the Shift key
and, while keeping the key down, click on the ball and drag it left to
near (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (-20.0,-15.0) m.  <b>Make sure</b> that you
are pressing the Shift key <b>before</b> clicking on the ball. Are you
getting the ball to move along a horizontal straight line?

<p>Display the position vectors and the data (see preceding section
titled "Average Velocity vs. Average Speed"), but not the grid.  You
should see something similar to what is shown in Figure 4 below.

<p align="center"><img src="AvVelocitystraight.jpg" alt="Straight
Path"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 4</b></p>

<p>In this case of straight-line motion in one direction, do the
average speed and magnitude of average velocity have the same values
in your case?  They do in Figure 4, namely, 7.3 m/s.

<p>Are the direction angles of the displacement and average velocity
the same?  They are in Figure 4, namely, 180<sup>o</sup>.

<p><b>Note</b>.  In dragging the ball along a straight line by holding
down the Shift key, it is important to drag steadily in one direction.
Otherwise, the path traveled may contain short vertical or diagonal
segments and the values displayed for distance traveled and average
speed may differ slightly from what you would expect.  Also,
overshooting a target point and backtracking slightly would result in
a distance traveled slightly larger than the magnitude of the
displacement.

<p>With the Shift key held down, you can also drag vertically or
diagonally in a 45<sup>o</sup>-direction.
