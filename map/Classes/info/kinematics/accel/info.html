   <p><h2>Instantaneous Acceleration - Applet Info</h2></p>

	<p><b>Motion Controls</b></p>

	<p><ul>

	<li><u>Setting the initial velocity</u>. Click on the car and drag
	with the mouse to set the car's initial velocity vector (shown in
	magenta).  If the car is not visible, because the Car check box is
	unselected, click on the yellow dot and drag.  Subsequently, if you
	are in Position Space view (Velocity Space check box unselected),
	you can drag the car itself to a new starting position.</li>

	<p>

	<li><u>Setting the car's acceleration</u>. Click in the
	acceleration dial to set the car's acceleration (shown in orange).
	The car will move with this acceleration, and its velocity and
	position will change accordingly.

	<p>To vary the car's acceleration, keep the mouse button depressed
	with the mouse pointer still in the acceleration dial and drag the
	acceleration vector.  Releasing the mouse button will pause the
	motion.  Clicking in the acceleration dial again, will resume the
	motion.</li>

	<p>

	<li><u>Play, Replay, and Step</u>.  The motion will start
	automatically as soon as you click in the acceleration dial.  To
	stop the motion, release the mouse button.  When you click REPLAY,
	the car will be reset to its initial position, velocity, and
	acceleration.  If you now click PLAY, the car will repeat its
	previous motion automatically without you having to steer the
	motion via the acceleration dial.  Instead of PLAY, which shows the
	previous motion continuously, you can use STEP to view the previous
	motion step-by-step.  PLAY/PAUSE is a toggle button that lets you
	pause and then resume the playing of the previous motion.</li>

	</ul>

	<p><b>Display Controls (Check Boxes)</b></p>

	<p><ul>

	<li><u>Velocity Space</u>.  When this check box is
	<b>un</b>selected, you can view things so that the position space
	origin is at rest and the car is moving.  The tail end of the
	velocity vector is attached to the car and therefore the velocity
	vector is shown moving with the car.

	<p>When the Velocity Space check box is selected, you can view
	things so that the origin of velocity space is at rest with the
	car.  The origin of position space and other points in position
	space (indicated by a background of dots) is shown moving relative
	to the car.</li>

	<p>

	<li><u>Car</u>.  When this check box is selected, the car will be
	shown.  If it is unselected, the car is replaced by a small black
	dot, visible only if no vectors are being displayed.</li>

	<p>

	<li><u>Pos Path and Vel Path</u>.  When these check boxes are
	selected, the paths of the tips of the position and velocity
	vectors, respectively, are shown, respectively, color-coded
	relative to these vectors.</li>

	<p>

	<li><u>Grid</u>.  When this check box is selected, a position space
	coordinate grid is shown.  If you are in the Position Space view
	(Velocity Space box unselected) while the Grid check box is
	selected, you can click on the applet window and drag all of
	position space, including the car, the coordinate grid, and origin
	of position space.  If the control key is depressed while you drag,
	position space will not be dragged, i.e., the car will remain
	stationary relative to the applet window, but the coordinate origin
	of position space and the coordinate grid will be dragged.  This
	corresponds to a change in coordinate system of position space.  If
	you select the Position Vector check box, you can see how the car's
	position vector can be varied this way without changing the car's
	position.</li>

	<p>

	<li><u>Position Vector, Velocity Vector, Accel #1, Accel #1</u>.
	Selecting any of these check boxes will cause the respective
	vectors to be displayed.  The difference between Accel #1 and Accel
	#2 is that the former shows the acceleration vector attached to the
	center of the car while the latter shows this vector attached to
	the tip of the velocity vector (as the velocity vector is shown
	attached to the tip of the position vector).  Of course, the
	acceleration vector is shown also in the acceleration dial.

	<p>The position vector is in cyan, the velocity vector in magenta,
	the acceleration vector in orange.</li>

	<p>

	<li><u>Data #1 and Data #2</u>.  When one of these check boxes is
	selected, the values of time/velocity/acceleration or
	time/position/velocity, respectively, are displayed.</li>

	</ul>
