  <ol>

    <p><li><u>Initial Position</u>

	 <p>Click the Reset button <img src="reset.gif" align="top">.

	 <p>Click on the ball and drag it to the initial position
	 (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (20.0, 10.0) m, as shown in Figure 1 below.
	 You may find this easier to do if you display the grid by pressing
	 the Grid toggle button <img src="grid.gif" align="top">.  (The
	 grid is not shown in Figure 1.) 

	 <p>It also helps to adjust one coordinate at a time.  Drag the
	 ball to <i>x</i> = 20.0 m without worrying about the
	 <i>y</i>-coordinate.  Then, hold down the Shift key while dragging
	 the ball.  Now the ball will move only vertically and it will be
	 much easier to adjust its initial <i>y</i>-coordinate to 10.0 m.
	 The <i>x</i>-coordinate will remain unchanged while the Shift key
	 is held down.

	 <p align="center"><img src="OneBallinitial.jpg"></p>

	 <p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

	 <p>Notice the shadow balls on the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes.
	 They move with the ball and are projections of the ball onto the
	 two axes.  Their positions represent the ball's <i>x</i> and
	 <i>y</i> coordinates.

    <p>The ball's <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> position coordinates are
    displayed in the top right corner of the applet.  These will be
    updated throughout the motion, along with the value <i>t</i> of
    the time elapsed.  Time elapsed is measured from the beginning of
    the motion.  Thus, at the beginning of the motion, <i>t</i> =
    0.</li>

	 <p><li><u>Initial Velocity</u>

	 <p>The magenta arrow represents the ball's initial velocity.
	 (During the motion it represents the ball's velocity at a given
	 instant.) Adjust the initial velocity to a magnitude of 20 m/s and
	 to a direction that forms an angle <font face="symbol">q</font>
	 with the positive <i>x</i>-axis equal to 60<sup>o</sup>.  Do this
	 by typing these values in the first column of the velocity data
	 panel, shown at the bottom of Figure 1, and then press the ENTER
	 key on the keyboard.

	 <p>Notice how the display of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components
	 of the ball's velocity is automatically adjusted to
	 <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = 10.0 m/s and <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> = 17.3
	 m/s.  You can enter values in any of the four velocity data
	 fields.  When you press ENTER, the values in the four fields are
	 adjusted automatically so that they are consistent.  The last
	 value entered and its partner in the same column are not
	 adjusted.

	 <p>You can adjust the initial velocity also by dragging the tip of
	 the velocity vector.  The four velocity data fields will be
	 adjusted accordingly.</li>

  </ol>

  <a name="BallMotion"><div class="sectionheading"> Observing the
  Ball's Motion</a>

  <ol>

    <p><li>Press the Play button <img src="start.gif" align="top"> to
    start the motion.  Display the ball's path by pressing the Trace
    toggle button <img src="trace.gif" align="top">.</li>

	 <p>When the ball has disappeared from the applet window, press the
	 Replay button <img src="replay.gif" align="top">.  Press the
	 Components toggle button <img src="components.gif" align="top"> to
	 display the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity
	 vector.  Then press Play once more and pause the motion on the way
	 up by clicking the Pause button <img src="pause.jpg" align="top">.
	 (Once the Play button is pressed, it changes into the Paus button,
	 and vice versa.)  You should see a display similar to that in
	 Figure 2 below.
	
    <p align="center"><img src="OneBallmotion1.jpg"></p>

    <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p></li>

	 <p><li>Click Replay once more.  This time, step through the motion
	 again by clicking the Step button <img src="step.gif" align="top">
	 repeatedly.  Observe that the horizontal component of the velocity
	 vector remains constant and, correspondingly, that the value of
	 <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> in the data panel stays constant at 10.0 m/s.
	 The vertical component of the velocity is continually decreasing
	 in magnitude on the way up, changes direction at the top, and then
	 is continually increasing in magnitude on the way down.
	 Correspondingly, the values of <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> in the data
	 panel are continually decreasing.  (Even when they are negative
	 they are decreasing.  E.g., -10 is <b>less</b> than -5.)</li>

	 <p><li>Click Replay once more and then Play.  Watch the continuous
	 motion again. Observe how the shadow ball on the <i>x</i>-axis
	 moves to the right with constant velocity.  Observe how the shadow
	 ball on the <i>y</i>-axis performs an up-and-down motion like a
	 ball thrown straight up.</li>

	 <p><li>Click Replay once more.  This time, change the
	 <i>x</i>-component of the ball's velocity to 20 m/s without
	 changing the <i>y</i>-component.  Then press Play.  Observe
	 that the ball is now moving more quickly in the horizontal
	 direction, but that its vertical motion is unaffected.  

	 <p>E.g., at <i>t</i> = 0.87 s, the vertical position of the ball
	 is <i>y</i> = 21.3 m and the <i>y</i>-component of velocity is 8.8
	 m/s in both cases, as you can check by comparing Figure 2 above
	 and Figure 3 below.  Also, comparing the two trajectories shows
	 that the ball reaches exactly the same height in both situations.

    <p align="center"><img src="OneBallmotion2.jpg"></p>

    <p align="center"><b>Figure 3</b></p></li>

	 <p><li>As a final element in the motion, you can observe the
	 ball's acceleration by pressing the Acceleration toggle button
	 <img src="vector.gif" align="top">.  The acceleration vector is
	 shown in green.

	 <p>Replay the motion along both of the previous trajectories by
	 setting the initial velocity component in the <i>x</i>-direction
	 equal to 10.0 m/s or 20.0 m/s, without changing the initial
	 <i>y</i>-component.  Display the components of the velocity
	 vector.  Observe the acceleration vector, and observe the behaviour
	 of the <i>y</i> component of the velocity vector during the
	 motion.  In particular, observe the acceleration vector at the
	 moment the ball reaches the top of its trajectory.

	 <p>In this simulation where there is no air resistance, the ball's
	 acceleration is equal to the acceleration due to gravity.  You can
	 vary the magnitude <i>g</i> of the acceleration due to gravity,
	 and therefore the magnitude of the ball's acceleration, between 0
	 and 20 m/s<sup2</sup> by means of the g-slider <img
	 src="OneBallgravity.gif" align="top">.

	 <p>Click Replay and set <i>g</i> to 5 m/s<sup>2</sup>.  Then play
	 the motion again, with either one of the previous two initial
	 velocities.  You should observe higher trajectories this time.</li>

  </ol>

align="top"></a></p>

	 <p>

	 <div class="sectionheading"><a name="Step">Stepping Through the
	 Motion</a></div>

    <p>Click Replay and set <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> to 20 m/s, but don't
    change the <i>y</i>-component of the initial velocity.  Step
    through the motion by clicking the Step button <img src="step.gif"
    align="top"> repeatedly until you reach the same elapsed time as
    in Figure 3, namely, <i>t</i> = 0.87 s.  You can do that by
    adjusting the Step slider <img src="OneBallstepslider.gif"
    align="top">.

    <p>The size of the time step used by the Step can be adjusted
    between 0.01 s and 1.00 s by moving the slider tab.  Fine
    adjustments by 0.01 s can be made by clicking in the "groove" of
    the slider, either to the left or to the right of the tab.

	 <p>First adjust the slider to a step size of 0.2 s, and take four
	 steps until you are at <i>t</i> = 0.80 s.  Then adjust the slider
	 to a step size of 0.01 s, and take seven more steps until you are
	 at <i>t</i> = 0.87 s.  Compare the position and velocity values
	 displayed by your applet to those shown in Figure 3 above.

	 <p>Fine-tuned stepping through a motion is useful in determining
	 the time required for the ball to reach a certain position, e.g.,
	 its maximum height, the time required to drop back down to the
	 <i>x</i>-axis, or the time required to reach a target.  (About
	 targets, see the next section.)

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

    <p>
	
    <div class="sectionheading"><a name="Target" align="top">Setting a
    Target and Measuring Point Coordinates </a></div>

	 <p>Select the Target button <img src="OneBalltarget.gif"
    align="top">. Then click anywhere in the applet window.  A bull's
    eye target will be placed at the point clicked.  The
    (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)-coordinates of the target's location will be
    displayed as long as the mouse button is depressed.  Dragging with
    the mouse will let you drag the target to a desired location.
    Click on the target a second time, and the target will removed,
    but only if the Target button is still selected.

    <p>The Draw-Point button <img src="OneBallpoint.gif" align="top">
  functions like the target button. Select it, and click anywhere in
  the applet window. A dot will be placed at the point clicked, and
  the (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)-coordinates of the dot will be displayed.
  This way you can measure the coordinates of a point.  The dot can be
  dragged to a new location as long as the mouse button is depressed.
  Click on the dot a second time, and the dot will be removed, but
  only if the Draw-Point button is still selected.

  <p><b>Exercise</b>.  Set a target and find an initial velocity so
  that the ball will hit the target.
