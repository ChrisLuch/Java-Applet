    <div class="sectionheading">The Ball's Acceleration Due Only to Air
    Resistance</div>

    <p><b>Exercise 1</b>.  Let's look at the ball's motion when it is
    subject only to air resistance and not gravity.

    <p>RESET the applet, and set the magnitude <i>g</i> of the
    acceleration due to gravity to 0.  Position the ball away from the
    origin at (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) = (20, 20) m.  Set the velocity to
    magnitude 20 m/s and direction that is horizontal and to the
    right, i.e., &theta; = 0.  Set the drag
    coefficient <i>C</i> to 0.004 kg/m.  The drag coefficient
    determines the magnitude <i>F<sub>air</sub></i> of the force of
    air resistance via the expression

    <p align="center"><i>F<sub>air</sub></i> = <i>C v</i><sup>2</sup>
    <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (1)

    <p>where <i>v</i> is the ball's speed.  The direction of the force
    of air resistance is always opposite to that of the velocity of
    the ball.

    <p>If the only force acting on the ball is the force of air
    resistance, Newton's second law applied to the ball combined with
    Expression (1) gives the following equation for the magnitude
    <i>a</i> of the ball's acceleration

    <p align="center"><i>C v</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>m a</i><img
    src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (2)

    <p>whence

    <p align="center"><i>a</i> = (<i>C</i>/<i>m</i>) v</i><sup>2</sup> .
    <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="40"> (3)

    <p>Thus, when there is air resistance, the ball's mass does have
    an effect on the ball's acceleration.  This is in contrast to free
    fall, where the ball is subject only to the force of gravity and
    the ball's acceleration does not depend on the ball's mass.  (The
    mass cancels out of the Newton's-second-law equation .)

    <p><b>Question </b>. Does the acceleration increase or decrease as
    the mass is increased?  Make a prediction based on Eq.(3), and
    check it by varying the ball's mass with the slider.  Does the
    magnitude of the acceleration vary as you predicted?

    <p><b>Exercise 2</b>. Set the ball's mass to 0.1 kg.  Display the
    velocity and acceleration vectors.  Figure 1 below shows what you
    should be able to see.

    <p align="center"><img src="OneBallOnlyAirRes.gif"

    <p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

    <p>PLAY the simulation.  In your Notebook, comment on the
    following. 
    </p>

	 <ul>
     <li>
      Is the motion as you would have expected it and why or why not?  
     </li>

     <li> Is the decrease of the magnitude of the acceleration
      consistent with Eq.(3)?  
     </li>
	  <li>
      What terminal speed does the ball approach? Try to explain what
      you observe from the applet.
     </li>
     <li>
      How much time will elapse until the ball reaches its terminal
     speed, and where will the ball be when it reaches this speed?
     </li>
   </ul>

    <p><u>Comment</u>. The motion of the ball is similar to that of a
    car coasting to a stop on a level road while the engine is
    disengaged.  However, there are also some differences.  Although
    at higher speeds, the car's air resistance force is well described
    by Expression (1), at lower speeds the quadratic dependence on
    speed is changed more to a linear dependence. There are other
    forces acting on the car as well, notably dissipative friction
    between the tires and the road.  As a result, the car comes to a
    definite stop in a finite time, unlike the ball in the
    simulation.</p>

	 class="sectionheading">The Ball's Acceleration Due to Air
	 Resistance and Gravity</div>

    <p><b>Exercise 1</b>. Now let's look at the ball's motion when
    the ball is subject to both the force of air resistance and the force of
    gravity.  Let's look at vertical motion where both forces are
    acting along the line of motion.

    <p>REWIND the applet, and change the initial velocity direction to
    vertically upward, i.e., &theta; =
    90<sup>o</sup>.  Keep the magnitude of the initial velocity equal
    to 20 m/s, <i>C</i> equal to 0.004 kg/m, and <i>m</i> equal to 0.1
    kg.  Make sure you change <i>g</i> from 0 to 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
    The velocity and acceleration vectors should look as in Figure 2
    below.  Also, move the ball upward to <i>y</i> = 30 m.

    <p align="center"><img src="OneBallAirPlusGravVertical.gif"
    alt="Acceleration Due to Air Resistance and Gravity - Vertical
    Motion"></p>

    <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

    <p>Notice that the acceleration vector's magnitude is greater in
    Figure 2 than in Figure 1, because the acceleration due to gravity
    is now added.

    <p><b>Exercise 2</b>. Play the simulation, and comment on the
    following in your Notebook.  
    </p>

	 <ul>
     <li>
      Is the acceleration zero when the ball reaches the top of its
      flight?  
    </li> 
	 <li>
      What is the acceleration equal to at the top of the ball's
      flight?
    </li>

	 <li>
     In what direction is the ball's acceleration on the ball's way
     down?  
    </li> 
    <li> 
     What is happening to the magnitude of the ball's acceleration
     when the ball is on its way down?
    </li>
	 <li>
     What is happening to the ball's speed when the ball is on its way
     down?
    </li>
    <li>
     What terminal speed does the ball approach?
    </li>
   </ul>

    <p><b>Problem 1</b>.  In the applet, the ball approaches a
    terminal speed of 15.7 m/s on its way down.  Using Eq.(3),
    determine the theoretical value for this speed and compare it with
    the value from the applet.

    <p><b>Solution</b>.  There are two forces acting on the ball, the
    force of gravity and the force of air resistance.  On the way
    down, these forces oppose each other: the force of gravity points
    downward and the force of air resistance upward.  As the ball's
    speed increases while the ball is falling, the magnitude of the
    force of air resistance increases quadratically with the speed.

    <p>As the force of air resistance approaches the force of gravity
    in magnitude, the net force and therefore the acceleration go to
    zero and the ball approaches a constant terminal velocity.  The
    terminal velocity is realized (only after an infinite amount of
    time has elapsed) when the force of air resistance has exactly the
    same magnitude as the force of gravity.

    <p>Using Expression (1) for the magnitude of the force of air
    resistance and the standard expression <i>mg</i> for the magnitude
    of the force of gravity, the terminal speed
    <i>v<sub>term</sub></i> is determined by the equation

    <p align="center"><i>C</i> <i>v<sub>term</sub></i><sup>2</sup> =

	 <p>Skydivers experience terminal speed, although the value in that
	 case is higher than value (5).  Both the mass and the drag
	 coefficient are different for a skydiver than the values used
	 here.

	 <p>Rain drops too reach ground with a terminal speed.  Their
	 terminal speed is a lot smaller than that of a skydiver.  If it
	 were otherwise, nobody would enjoy dancing in the rain very
	 much.</p>

	 <p><b>Exercise 3</b>.  REWIND the applet, and keep all settings as
	 in the preceding section "The Ball's Acceleration Due To Air
	 Resistance And Gravity - Vertical Motion".  Measure the time it
	 takes the ball to reach the top, by stepping the ball to this
	 position, and then the time it takes to fall back down to the
	 starting level.

	 <p>When there is no air resistance, it takes the same amount of
	 time for a ball to go up and to come down.  Is this still true
	 when there is air resistance?  If not, which time is larger?  Can
	 you explain what you find?

	 <p>Hint.  Sketch the <i>y</i>-component <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> of
	 the ball's velocity during the ball's up-and-down motion vs. time.
	 You can obtain the <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>-values from the applet
	 while you step through the motion.  Remember that the area between
	 the graph of <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> vs. <i>t</i> and the
	 <i>t</i>-axis for a given time interval represents the ball's
	 displacement during that time interval.  An area below the
	 <i>t</i>-axis represents a negative displacement.</p>

    <div class="sectionheading">The Ball's Acceleration Due to Air
  Resistance and Gravity - Nonvertical Motion</div>

	 <p>
	 <b>Exercise 1</b>.  This time let us investigate the effect of
	 air resistance when the force of air resistance does not act along
	 the same line as the force of gravity.

	 <p>REWIND the applet, and set the initial velocity angle to
	 60<sup>o</sup>.  Keep all other settings as in the preceding two
	 sections.  Display the velocity and acceleration vectors.

	 <p>Figure 3 below shows the initial velocity and acceleration
	 vectors.  The acceleration is equal to the vector sum of the
	 acceleration due to air resistance, which is oppositely directed
	 to the velocity, and the acceleration due to gravity, which is
	 downward.  The result is an acceleration that is somewhere in
	 between these two and not in line with either one.

    <p align="center"><img src="OneBallAirPlusGrav.gif"></p>

    <p align="center"><b>Figure 3</b></p>
	 
	 <p><b>Exercise 2</b>.  Play the motion.  The motion should be
	 along the lower of the two trajectories shown in Figure 3.  
	 
	 <p>Rewind the applet, and set the drag coefficient <i>C</i> to
	 0. Play the motion again. The motion should now be along the upper
	 one of the two trajectories shown in Figure 3.

	 <p>Qualitatively, explain why one gets these two trajectories for
	 the two settings of <i>C</i>.

	 <p><b>Question 1</b>.  In the accompanying Lesson, in Exercise 2 at
	 the end of the section "Predicting the Ball's Motion", we found
	 that the ball's motion is reversible when there is no air
	 resistance.  Is the motion still reversible when there is air
	 resistance?

	 <p><b>Answer</b>. Use the applet to find out.  REWIND the applet,
	 and STEP the motion with air resistance forward to <i>t</i> = 3.0
	 s.  You should find the following position and velocity values:

	 <p align="center">(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) = (37.08, 27.02) m, <img
	 src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="20"> (<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,
	 <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) = (3.1, -12.2) m/s.<img src="small.gif"
	 alt="space" height="1" width="20"> (6)

	 <p>In your Notebook, make a drawing of the velocity and
	 acceleration vectors at this point and record their values.  Then
	 REWIND the applet.

	 <p>Drag the ball back to the position setting recorded in Eqs.(6).
	 Actually, set the position to (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) = (37.00,
	 27.00) m.  That's as close as the applet will let you.  This will
	 be close enough.

	 <p>Remember that it is easiest if you adjust the
	 <i>x</i>-coordinate first and then adjust the <i>y</i>-coordinate
	 with the Shift key held down.  Readjust the velocity to the values
	 recorded in Equations (6).  You should see the velocity and
	 acceleration vectors displayed as you have drawn them in your
	 Notebook.

	 <p>Now reverse the velocity.  The easiest way to do this is by
    reversing the signs in front of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
    components of the velocity, i.e., to set these to
    (<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>, <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) = (-3.2, 12.2) m/s.
    Notice the velocity and acceleration vectors now!  The vectors are
    shown in Figure 4 below, which shows the ball at the <i>t</i> =
    3.0-s position of the original motion, but with the velocity
    vector reversed.  (Note that the applet resets the time to 0.) 

    <p align="center"><img src="OneBallReversed.gif"></p>

    <p align="center"><b>Figure 4</b></p>

	 <p>Compared to the drawing in your Notebook, the velocity vector
    in Figure 4 is reversed, as expected, but the acceleration vector
    looks quite different from that in your Notebook.  Can you explain
    why?

	 <p>For the motion to be reversible, the acceleration vector should
    <b>not</b> change.  The fact that it changes quite a bit upon
    velocity reversal indicates that reversing the velocity does not
    reverse the motion.  PLAY the applet, and observe the motion.  You
    should see a trajectory like the lower trajectory in Figure 4.  It
    is quite different from the initial trajectory.

	 <p>Generally speaking, motions cannot be reversed when they are
	 affected by dissipative friction, as is the case here.  In the
	 macroscopic world, dissipative friction is everywhere to some
	 degree.  So macroscopic motions, and macroscopic processes in
	 general, tend to be irreversible.

	 <p><b>Question 2</b>.  When a block slides on a horizontal table,
	 the block's motion will come to a stop.  Is this motion
	 reversible?  What would the reversed motion look like?
