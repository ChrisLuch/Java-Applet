<div class="title">Help - Projectile Motion: One Ball</div>

<p><div class="sectionheading">The applet shows a ball performing
projectile motion with or without air resistance</div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">


<p>The simulation assumes that the acceleration of the ball
consists of two parts: one due to gravity and one due to air
resistance.  The former is constant, the latter has magnitude
proportional to the square of the ball's speed and direction opposite
to the ball's velocity.

<p>Expressed in symbols, the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components of the
ball's acceleration, <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>a<sub>y</sub></i>,
are equal to:

<p><div align="center"><i>a<sub>x</sub></i> =
-(<i>C</i>/<i>m</i>)<i>v</i><i>v<sub>x</sub></i>

<img src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> and <img src="small.gif"
height="1" width="20">

<i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = -<i>g</i> -
(<i>C</i>/<i>m</i>)<i>v</i><i>v<sub>y</sub></i>,
</div>

<p>where <i>C</i> is the drag coefficient, <i>m</i> the ball's mass,
<i>v</i> the ball's speed, <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> and
<i>v<sub>y</sub></i> the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>-components of the
ball's velocity, and <i>g</i> the magnitude of the acceleration due to
gravity.

<p>The <i>x</i>-axis is horizontal and points to the right, and the
<i>y</i>-axis is vertical and points upward.

<p>These two equations can be expressed by the one vector equation

<p align="center"><img src="a.gif" align="bottom"> = <img src="g.gif"
align="absbottom"> - (<i>C</i>/<i>m</i>) <i>v</i> <img src="v.gif"
align="bottom"> .</p>

<p>The drag coefficient <i>C</i> for an object determines the
magnitude of the force of air resistance on the object,

<p align="center"><img src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>res</sub> = -
<i>C</i> <i>v</i> <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> .</p>

<p><i>C</i> depends on the shape and size of the object, not directly
on the mass of the object.  

<p>Often, a change in an object's mass will be accompanied by a change
in the object's size and therefore the value of <i>C</i>. In the
applet, however, changing the mass has no effect on <i>C</i>.  You may
imagine that the object is hollow and that increasing its mass is
accomplished by filling some of the interior of the object.
