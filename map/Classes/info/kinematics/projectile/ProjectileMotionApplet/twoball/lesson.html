      <b>Prerequisites</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should be familiar with the concepts of velocity and
      acceleration, at the vector level, and have a working
      knowledge of the kinematical equations for motion with
      constant acceleration in one and two dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Learning Outcomes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students will learn that, in the absence of air resistance,
      projectile motion of an object can be described as a
      superposition of two motions: a motion with constant velocity
      equal to the object's initial velocity and a uniformly
      accelerated motion starting from rest with acceleration due
      to gravity. They will learn to use this understanding to make
      calculations on projectile motion and will get practice in
      working with the kinematical equations of motion with
      constant acceleration, in one and two dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should know how the applet functions, as described
      in Help and ShowMe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in
      the following text are to be done in the applet. You may need
      to toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if
      your screen space is limited.

      <b>Question 1</b>. Suppose Ball 1 (red) is dropped from an
      elevated position from rest and Ball 2 (orange) is thrown
      horizontally from the same level as Ball 1. Which ball will
      hit the ground (<i>x</i>-axis) first if air resistance is
      negligible?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. One might be tempted to say that Ball 1 would
      reach the ground first because it is starting to move down
      right away while Ball 2 is starting out horizontally. Let's
      first investigate this "experimentally" with the applet. Then
      in Point 2 let's confirm the observations by calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      RESET the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set the positions and velocities of the two balls to
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>1</sub> =
      (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>2</sub> = (0, 40.0) m. <img src=

      The applet will display a configuration as in Figure 1 below.

    <p>
      PLAY the motion, and observe which ball reaches the
      <i>x</i>-axis first. Display the balls' paths if you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does it look like both balls reach the <i>x</i>-axis at the
      same time? Confirm this by stepping through the motion and
      measuring the times required for each ball to reach the
      <i>x</i>-axis. Also observe their vertical (<i>y</i>)
      components of velocity when the balls reach the
      <i>x</i>-axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. At <i>t</i> = 2.85 s, <i>both</i> balls are at
      <i>y</i> = 0.16 m with the same velocity component
      <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> = -27.9 m/s. At <i>t</i> = 2.86 s both
      balls are at <i>y</i> = -0.12 m, which is below the
      <i>x</i>-axis, and have the velocity component
      <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> = -28.0 m/s. Interpolating between the
      two times gives approximately for the moment when <b>both</b>
      balls reach the <i>x</i>-axis:
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>t</i> = 2.856 s, <img src="small.gif" alt="space"

         alt="space" height="1" width="20"> <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> =
         -27.96 m/s. <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1"
         width="40"> (2)
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment</u>. The two balls reach the <i>x</i>-axis at the
      same time and with the same <i>y</i>-component of velocity!
      Thus, their vertical motions are identical. You can confirm
      this by observing the values of <i>y</i> and
      <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> at in-between time points. They will
      always be the same for the two balls. Of course, the
      horizontal (<i>x</i>) components of velocity of the two balls
      are different. That of Ball 2 is equal to 15 m/s throughout
      while that of Ball 1 is 0. The motion of Ball 2 can be
      characterized as follows.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Ball 2 moves as if it carried out two motions at the same
      time: a horizontal motion with constant velocity
                  <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align=
                  "bottom">(0) and a vertical motion of free fall
                  identical to that of Ball 1, which is dropped
                  from rest. The horizontal and vertical motions
                  are independent of each other. Modifying the
                  horizontal velocity does not affect the vertical
                  motion.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This is illustrated in Figure 2 below. The net displacement
      <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align="bottom"> of Ball 2 in
      going from the start of the motion to the position shown in
      Figure 2 is the vector sum of the ball's horizontal
      displacement <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align=
      "bottom">(0) <i>t</i> and vertical displacement (<img src=
      "g.gif" alt="vector g" align="absbottom">/2)
      <i>t</i><sup>2</sup>. These two displacements are progressing
      simultaneously as Ball 2 is moving along the orange
      trajectory.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the linear and quadratic time dependencies of these
      displacements indicate, the horizontal displacement proceeds
      with constant velocity equal to <img src="v.gif" alt=
      "vector v" align="bottom">(0) and the vertical displacement
      with constant acceleration equal to <img src="g.gif" alt=
      "vector g" align="absbottom">.

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Repeat the measurements above with a
      horizontal velocity for Ball 2 different from 15 m/s. Do the
      results come out the same?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Repeat Exercise 1 with air resistance.
      Take <i>C</i> = 0.002 kg/m, and the mass of Ball 2 equal to
      0.1 kg. Observe the times it takes Ball 2 to reach the
      <i>x</i>-axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be able to observe that the times are different
      for different horizontal velocities. This demonstrates that
      when there is air resistance, the horizontal motion does
      affect the vertical motion. Thus, the assumption of no air
      resistance is critical for the indented statement above to be
      true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. How do you calculate the time required for
      Ball 2 to reach the <i>x</i>-axis when there is no air
      resistance?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Without the knowledge gained above, this might
      seem like a difficult two-dimensional problem. However,
      knowing that the vertical motion of Ball 2 is just like that
      of Ball 1 reduces this to a straight-forward one-dimensional
      problem for a motion with constant acceleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equations in the Appendix <a href=
      "#ConstantAcceleration">Equations For Motion With Constant
      Acceleration</a> will provide the answers. Since the
      acceleration of Ball 1, due to gravity, is downward and the
      velocity of Ball 1 here is always downward as well, we can
      make our lives simpler by choosing the direction of the
      <i>y</i>-axis to be downward in the calculation, thus using a
      direction <b>opposite</b> to that used by the applet and
      shown in Figure 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, since all quantities are going to be positive, let's
      use magnitudes in place of components for the calculation.
      Thus, instead of <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> and
      <i>a<sub>y</sub></i>, we'll use <i>v</i> and <i>a</i>,
      respectively. Also,
    </p>

      <i>v</i>(0) = 0, <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1"

      Adjust the initial velocity of Ball 1 so that Ball 1 is
      "aimed" at Ball 2. This is the case if the initial velocity
      components of Ball are in the same ratio as the corresponding
      coordinates of the position of Ball 2, i.e., if
      <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>/<i>v<sub>y</sub></i> = 40/50. This is
      the case for the following choice of initial velocity of Ball
      1:
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      (<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>, <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>)<sub>1</sub> =
      (20.0, 25.0) m/s. <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1"

      Figure 3 below illustrates the initial conditions (7) and
      (8).

    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can test that the initial velocity (8) is aimed straight
      at Ball 2 by setting the magnitude <i>g</i> of the
      acceleration due to gravity equal to 0 and PLAYing the
      motion. Ball 1 will move along the straight red line shown in
      Figure 3 that goes through Ball 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      If both balls move without air resistance and if <i>g</i> =
      9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>, will Ball 1 hit Ball 2 or will they miss
      each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Try to find the answer "experimentally" with
      the applet. (In Question 2 below, the question will be
      answered theoretically.) Make sure that the drag coefficient
      <i>C</i> of Ball 2 is set to zero in the following
      experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure that <i>g</i> is set to 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may be tempted to think that, with <i>g</i> not equal to
      zero, velocity (8) will not lead to a collision between the
      balls, because Ball 2 will move away from the spot towards
      which Ball 1 is aimed. However, you should find that the
      balls will in fact collide. They will collide at the point
      where the curved red and the vertical yellow trajectories in
      Figure 3 intersect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Change the initial velocity of Ball 1 to
      another one that differs from velocity (8) in magnitude only.
      To be aiming directly at Ball 2, the ratio of initial
      velocity components <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>/<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>
      must equal 40/50 = 4/5. You should find that the balls will
      collide whatever the magnitude of the initial velocity of
      Ball 1, as long as this velocity is aimed at Ball 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. Why does the initial conditions
      illustrated in Figure 3 lead to a collision between the two
      balls?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The answer is contained in the equations for
      projectile motion listed in the Appendix on <a href=
      "#ConstantAcceleration">Equations For Motion With Constant
      Acceleration</a>. We need Equation (A4). Setting <img src=
      "a.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom"> = <img src="g.gif"
         alt="vector g" align="absbottom"> in that equation gives
         the equation for the displacement <img src="d.gif" alt=
         "vector d" align="bottom"> of an object performing
         projectile motion:
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <img src="d.gif" alt="vector d" align="bottom">(<i>t</i>) =
      <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">(0)<i>t</i> +
      (<img src="g.gif" alt="vector g" align="absbottom">/2)
      <i>t</i><sup>2</sup>. <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
         height="1" width="20"> (9)
    </p>
    <p>
      This equation says that the displacement at time <i>t</i>is
      the sum of two terms, <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
         align="bottom">(0)<i>t</i> and (<img src="g.gif" alt=
         "vector g" align="absbottom">/2) <i>t</i><sup>2</sup>. In
         words, this equation amounts to the following <i>Principle
         of Projectile Motion</i>. (This name is not in general
         use, but let's use it here when referring to the following
         statement.)
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <b>Principle of Projectile Motion</b>. The projectile motion
      of an object subject to no air resistance is a superposition
      of two motions: a motion with a constant velocity equal to
      the object's initial velocity and a motion with constant
      acceleration <img src="g.gif" alt="vector g"
                  align="absbottom"> starting from rest.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 1</u>. The time instant referred to in "initial
      velocity" and "starting from rest" in this statement is the
      time instant <i>t</i> = 0 in Eq.(9). For a given projectile
      motion, any time instant can be chosen to be the initial one.
      Eq.(9) will always apply, but the initial velocity
         <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">(0) will
         have different values if the time <i>t</i> = 0 refers to
         different instants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 2</u>. The term "projectile motion" applies to the
      motion of an object in a uniform gravitational field. Such a
      field exists to a very good approximation within a region of
      space extending a few kilometers horizontally and vertically
      from a given point on the earth's surface. Motions extending
      over a larger range, in which the earth's curvature and the
      decrease of the value of <i>g</i> with elevation become
      significant, are called "ballistic motions".
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 3</u>. The Principle of Projectile Motion is
      equivalent to the following description of projectile motion.
      Sometimes one, sometimes the other may be more useful.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The projections of projectile motion onto the horizontal and
      vertical axes - imagine them performed by two shadow balls -
      are motions with constant velocity and constant acceleration,
      respectively. The acceleration of the shadow ball moving on
      the vertical axis is downward and, on earth, has magnitude
      <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      What does the Principle of Projectile Motion imply when Ball
      1 has its initial velocity aimed at Ball 2 as in Figure 3?
      The implication is illustrated in Figure 4 below.
    </p>

    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 4</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose an amount of time <i>t</i> elapses until Ball 1
      reaches the straight-down trajectory of Ball 2. During this
      time interval, Ball 1 undergoes the straight-line
      constant-velocity displacement <img src="v.gif" alt=
      "vector v" align="bottom">(0)<i>t</i> that if it existed by
      itself would take the ball to the starting point of Ball 2.
      In addition, simultaneously with the straight-line
      displacement, there is the straight-down free-fall
      displacement (<img src="g.gif" alt="vector g" align=
      "absbottom">/2) <i>t</i><sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This combimation of two displacements takes Ball 1 exactly to
      where Ball 2 is at time <i>t</i>, because Ball 2 also has
      undergone a downward displacement of (<img src="g.gif"
         alt="vector g" align="absbottom">/2) <i>t</i><sup>2</sup>
         during this time interval. The two simultaneous
         displacements of Ball 1 are shown in blue and the downward
         displacement of Ball 2 is shown in mustard color in Figure
         4. This completes the explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 3</b>. How much time elapses until the two balls
      collide?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The Principle of Projectile Motion is again
      the key to the answer. Of the two motions contributing to the
      projectile motion of Ball 1, only the motion with the
      constant velocity <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align=
      "bottom">(0) has a non-zero <i>x</i>-component that will move
      the ball towards the vertical fall line of Ball 2. Since
      <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = 20.0 m/s and since Ball 1 has to make
      a horizontal displacement &Delta;<i>x</i> = 40.0 m to reach the vertical
      trajectory of Ball 2, the amount of time <i>t</i> required is
    </p>

      <b>Question 4</b>. Set a target at (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) =
      (40.0, 10.0) m on the vertical trajectory of Ball 2. The
      position of the target is illustrated in Figure 5 below. What
      initial velocity must Ball 1 have in order to collide with
      Ball 2 at this target? You may want to try a few velocities
      with the applet. In what direction should the initial
      velocity of Ball 1 be?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. The direction of the initial velocity of Ball
      1 should be aimed at Ball 2, just like in Questions 1 and 2
      and for the same reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find the magnitude of the initial velocity, or the
      <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components of the initial velocity,
      let's first determine how much time it takes for Ball 2 to
      fall down to the target.
    </p>
    <p>
      This problem is identical to the problem that had to be
      solved in connection with Question 2 of the previous section
      "The Effect Of Horizontal Velocity On Time Of Fall". Even the
      magnitude of the vertical displacement is the same here as
      there, namely, 40 m (from 50 m down to 10 m). Thus the time
      required for both balls to reach the target is given by
      result (5)
    </p>

      <i>t</i> = 2.857 s . <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
         height="1" width="40"> (11)
    </p>
    <p>
      Ball 1 is moving with constant horizontal velocity
      <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0). In order for the ball to make a
      horizontal displacement &Delta;<i>x</i>
      = 40 m in a time <i>t</i> = 2.857 s, <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0)
      must be equal to
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0) = &Delta;<i>x</i>/t = 40/2.857 = 14.0 m/s .
         <img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40">
         (12)
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pointed out earlier, that if Ball 1 is to be aimed at
      Ball 2 initially, the ratio
      <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0)/<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>(0) of the
      initial velocity components of Ball 1 must be 4/5 or
      <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>(0)/<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0) = 5/4. Thus,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>(0) = (5/4)<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(0) =
      (5/4)x14.0 = 17.5 m/s . <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40"> (13)
    </p>
    <p>
      Eqs.(12) and (13) give the initial velocity of Ball 1 for the
      two balls to collide at the target.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's verify this by means of the applet. REWIND the applet,
      set the initial velocity of Ball 1 to values (12) and (13)
      and STEP the motion forward to <i>t</i> = 2.80 s. Ball 1
      should be very close to Ball 2. Now reduce the time step to a
      size of 0.01 s, and step forward to <i>t</i> = 2.85 s. Ball 1
      should be at <i>x</i> = 39.91 m, and the balls should be
      almost totally overlapping. Both balls have elevation
      <i>y</i> = 10.05 m. Move forward one more step to <i>t</i> =
      2.86 s. Ball 1 will have overshot its mark slightly and be at
      <i>x</i> = 40.05 m. Both balls will have elevation <i>y</i> =
      9.95 m. Thus, the time required is indeed somewhere in
      between 2.85 s and 2.86 s, as predicted by the calculated
      value (11). Figure 5 below shows the initial positions and
      velocities of both balls and the trajectories of the two
      balls intersecting the target.

      <u>Axes and Components</u>. In the following equations for
      the motion of a particle with constant acceleration it is
      assumed that an <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> coordinate system has been
      chosen and that the particle has the same acceleration
      everywhere, with constant <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components
      <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>a<sub>y</sub></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Sign Changes</u>. In the diagram in Figure A1 above, the
      direction of the acceleration vector is such that both the
      <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components of the vector are positive.
      In another situation, the direction of the vector may be
      different, so that one or both of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
      components may be negative. (Or the direction of the vector
      may be as shown, but the directions of the <i>x</i> and
      <i>y</i> axes may have been chosen differently, again causing
      one or both components of the vector to be negative.) The
      equations below apply to all such situations. No signs in
      these equations need to be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>2D vs. 1D</u>. The following equations are formulated for
      the 2D case, motion in two dimensions. However, they also
      apply to 1D motion, motion along a straight line. In this
      case, it will often be convenient to choose either the
      <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> axis to be along the line of motion.
      Assuming the motion is along the <i>x</i> axis, you will need
      only the equations for the <i>x</i> components. All <i>y</i>
      components in any of the equations will be zero. Similarly,
      if the motion is restricted to the <i>y</i>-axis, just use
      the <i>y</i> equations and ignore the <i>x</i> equations.
