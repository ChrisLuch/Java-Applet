      Setting the Ball's Initial Position and Velocity

      <p>
        <b>Exercise 1 (Initial Position)</b>. Reset <img src=
        "Reset.gif" alt="Reset" align="top"> the applet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Press the Data button <img src="Data.gif" alt="Data"
           align="top"> to display the Data box. It displays the
           ball's <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> position coordinates. They
           are updated when you drag the ball.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click on the ball, and drag it to the initial position
        (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = (20.0, 10.0) m, as shown in Figure 1
        below. You may find this easier to do if you display the
        grid by pressing the Grid toggle button <img src="Grid.gif"
        alt="Grid" align="top">. (The grid is not shown in Figure
        1.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It also helps to adjust one coordinate at a time. Drag the
        ball to <i>x</i> = 20.0 m without worrying about the
        <i>y</i>-coordinate. Then, hold down the Shift key while
        dragging the ball. Now the ball will move only vertically,
        and it will be much easier to adjust its initial
        <i>y</i>-coordinate to 10.0 m. The <i>x</i>-coordinate will
        remain unchanged while the Shift key is held down.
      </p>

        <b>Figure 1</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice the shadow balls on the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes.
        They move with the ball and are projections of the ball
        onto the two axes. Their positions represent the ball's
        <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Exercise 2 (Initial Velocity)</b>. The magenta arrow
        represents the ball's velocity. Adjust the initial velocity
        so that its magnitude is 20 m/s and its direction forms an
        angle <font face="symbol">q</font> with the positive
        <i>x</i>-axis equal to 60<sup>o</sup>. Do this by typing
        these values in the third and fourth velocity data fields,
        shown at the bottom of Figure 1, and then press the ENTER
        key on the keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice how the display of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
        components of the ball's velocity is automatically adjusted
        to <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = 10.0 m/s and <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>
        = 17.3 m/s. You can enter values in any of the four
        velocity data fields. When you press ENTER, the values in
        the other fields are adjusted automatically so that they
        are consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can adjust the initial velocity also by dragging the
        tip of the velocity vector. The four velocity data fields
        will be adjusted accordingly.

      <p>
        <b>Exercise 1</b>. REWIND the applet, display the Data box,
        and make sure that the ball's initial position and velocity
        are as in the previous section. These values are listed
        below. Otherwise, RESET the applet and then adjust the
        applet to these values.

      <p>
        PLAY the motion. Display the ball's path by pressing the
        Trace toggle button <img src="Trace.gif" alt="Trace"
           align="top">.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the ball has disappeared from the applet window,
        REWIND <img src="Rewind.gif" alt="Rewind" align="top"> the
        applet and click PLAY once more to watch the motion again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Observe how the shadow ball on the <i>x</i>-axis moves to
        the right with constant velocity. Observe how the shadow
        ball on the <i>y</i>-axis performs an up-and-down motion
        like a ball thrown straight up
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Exercise 2</b>. REWIND the applet, and press the
        Components toggle button <img src="Components.gif" alt=
        "Components" align="top"> to display the horizontal and
        vertical components of the velocity vector. PLAY the motion
        again and PAUSE it on the way up. Figure 2 below
        illustrates what you might see.

        <b>Figure 2</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Exercise 3</b>. REWIND the applet. This time, STEP
        <img src="Step.gif" alt="Step" align="top"> through the
        motion by clicking the Step button repeatedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Observe that the horizontal component of the velocity
        vector remains constant and, correspondingly, that the
        value of <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> in the data panel stays
        constant at 10.0 m/s. The vertical component of the
        velocity is continually decreasing in magnitude on the way
        up, changes direction at the top, and then is continually
        increasing in magnitude on the way down. Correspondingly,
        the values of <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> in the data panel are
        continually decreasing. (Even when they are negative they
        are decreasing. E.g., -10 is <b>less</b> than -5.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Exercise 4</b>. REWIND the applet. This time, change the
        <i>x</i>-component of the ball's velocity to 20 m/s without
        changing the <i>y</i>-component. Then press Play. Observe
        that the ball is now moving more quickly in the horizontal
        direction, but that its vertical motion is unaffected.
      </p>
    <p>
      To observe this in detail, REWIND the applet and then STEP it
      forward to the time at which you paused the motion in Exercise
      2.  Here, this is at <i>t</i> = 0.87 s.  Figure 3 below shows
      the applet at <i>t</i> = 0.87 s.  The vertical position of the
      ball is <i>y</i> = 21.34 m, compared to <i>y</i> = 21.36 in
      Figure 2, and the <i>y</i>-component of velocity is 8.8 m/s in
      both Figures 2 and 3. Also, the two trajectories have the same
      height.
     </p>
     <p>
      The slight discrepancy of 0.02 m in the value of <i>y</i> in
      Figures 2 and 3 is the result of a round-off in the
      <i>y</i>-component of the velocity.  When the applet calculates
      <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> from <i>v</i> and <font
      face="symbol">q</font> as in Exercise 2, it works with the exact
      value of <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>, which to four decimals is 17.3205
      m/s, but displays <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> only to one decimal as
      17.3 m/s in the data field.  In Exercise 4, when the value of
      <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> is changed to 20.0 m/s and ENTER is
      pressed, the applet takes the value of <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> =
      17.3 m/s that is displayed in the Data field to be exact.

      <p align="center">

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Exercise 5</b>. As a final element of the motion,
        observe the ball's acceleration. Do so by selecting the
        Vectors toggle button <img src="Vectors.gif" alt="Vectors"
        align="top"> and checking Acceleration in the panel that
        opens up. The acceleration vector will be shown as an
        orange arrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Replay the previous two motions, and observe the
        acceleration vector each time. To replay the motions, click
        REWIND and set the initial velocity component in the
        <i>x</i>-direction equal to either 10.0 m/s or 20.0 m/s,
        without changing the initial <i>y</i>-component. Then PLAY
        the motion. Observe that the acceleration vector is
        constant throughout each motion and is the same for both
        motions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Replay the two motions once more, but this time display the
        components of the velocity vector. Since the
        <i>x</i>-component of the velocity is constant, all changes
        in the velocity are due to those in the <i>y</i>-component.
        Observe the behaviour of the velocity vector and of its
        <i>y</i>-component during the motion. The tips of both
        should be moving downward at a constant rate, when the ball
        is on its way up, right at the top, and when it is on its
        way down. Remember that acceleration is the rate at which
        the tip of the velocity vector is moving.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this simulation where there is no air resistance, the
        ball's acceleration is equal to the acceleration due to
        gravity. You can vary the magnitude <i>g</i> of the
        acceleration due to gravity, and therefore the magnitude of
        the ball's acceleration, between 0 and 20 m/s<sup>2</sup>
        by means of the g-slider. Replay the two motions for
        another value of <i>g</i>, and again observe the
        acceleration and the motions of the tip of the velocity
        vector and its <i>y</i>-component.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also observe that a smaller value of <i>g</i> results in a
        higher trajectory.

        <b>Exercise 1</b>. Rewind the applet, set
        <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> to 20 m/s, and make sure the
        <i>y</i>-component of the initial velocity is still 17.3
        m/s. Step <img src="Step.gif" alt="Step" align="top">
        through the motion by clicking the Step button repeatedly
        until you reach the same elapsed time as in Figure 3,
        namely, <i>t</i> = 0.87 s. Adjust the Time Step slider to
        large time steps at first, say, 0.20 s, and then to 0.01-s
        time steps as you approach <i>t</i> = 0.87 s..
      </p>
      <p>
        Compare the position and velocity values displayed by your
        applet to those shown in Figure 3 above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fine-tuned stepping through a motion is useful in
        determining the time required for the ball to reach a
        certain position, e.g., its maximum height, the time
        required to drop back down to the <i>x</i>-axis, or the
        time required to reach a target. (About targets, see the
        next section.)
