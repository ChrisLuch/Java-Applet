  Car on a Level Corner</h1>
<p><span class="general">The simplest case to case to consider involves a car 
  turning at a normal, flat intersection. Here the bank angle is zero degrees 
  so make sure that the angle slider on the applet is set at 0<sup>o</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="general">As you learned earlier, there are three forces that are 
  important in understanding the motion of a car as it rounds a corner:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="general">the gravitational force or weight of the car acting 
    straight down</span></li>
  <li><span class="general">the normal force or response of the road against the 
    car acting at right angles to the road surface</span></li>
  <li><span class="general">the force of friction</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="general">It is easy to see in this case that the frictional force is 
  the only force that can act inward to supply the force needed to deflect the 
  car from its original direction of motion into a circular turn. Let's investigate 
  this a little closer by looking at the force needed to deflect the car moving 
  at 15 m/s around a corner of radius 80 m. Consider these steps:</p>
<h2>Get the acceleration</h2>
<p><span class="general">Remember that the acceleration of a body moving in a 
  circular path is given by the expression for centripetal acceleration:</span></p>
