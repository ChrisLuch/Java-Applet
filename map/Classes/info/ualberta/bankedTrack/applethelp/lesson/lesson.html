<p><span class="general">What keeps your car on the road when turning a corner? 
  Why do you skid when you hit an icy patch? Why are the corners of most highway 
  interchanges sloped or banked? These are some of the questions that will be 
  explored in this lesson. In particular you will learn about: </span> </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="general"> the normal force and the role it plays in the physics 
    of a car in a turn</span></li>
  <li><span class="general"> the frictional force and how it acts </span></li>
  <li><span class="general"> the force(s) needed to deflect the car in a circular 
    path around a corner </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="1"></a>Getting to Know the Applet - Car on a Banked Road</h2>
<p><span class="general">Spend a little time &quot;playing&quot; with the applet. 
  Try adjusting the speed of the car, coefficient of friction and angle of the 
  roadway (the &quot;bank angle&quot;). Observe under what conditions the car 
  will either skid inward or outward and what you need to do to counteract this.</span></p>
<p><span class="general">Once you have run the applet a few times you should explore 
  the forces acting on the car. Toggle the force button and show the free-body 
  diagram. Again observe how the forces change with varying speed, coefficient 
  of friction or bank angle. When you are ready, please answer the following:</span></p>
<ol>
  <li><span class="general">Explain why the free-body diagrams only show three 
    forces acting on the car (We are ignoring air resistance here)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span class="general">What force or forces cause the car to round the corner 
    and in what direction do these forces act?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span class="general">During an outward skid, does a force cause the car 
    to skid outward? If so, identify this force?</span></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="2"></a>Car on a Level Corner</h2>
<p><span class="general">The simplest case to consider involves a car turning 
  at a normal, flat intersection. Here the bank angle is zero degrees so make 
  sure that the angle slider on the applet is set at 0&deg;.</span></p>
<p><span class="general">As you learned earlier, there are three forces that are 
  important in understanding the motion of a car as it rounds a corner:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="general">the gravitational force or weight of the car acting 
    straight down</span></li>
  <li><span class="general">the normal force or response of the road against the 
    car acting at right angles to the road surface</span></li>
  <li><span class="general">the force of friction</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="general">It is easy to see in this case that the frictional force is 
  the only force that can act inward to supply the force needed to deflect the 
  car from its original direction of motion into a circular turn. Let's investigate 
  this a little closer by looking at the force needed to deflect the car moving 
  at 15 m/s around a corner of radius 80 m. Consider these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li value="4"><span class="general"><b>Get the acceleration</b></span><b> </b>: 
    <span class="general">Remember that the acceleration of a body moving in a 
    circular path is given by the expression for centripetal acceleration:</span> 
    <span class="general"><img src="bank_eq1.gif" width="154" height="56" align="absmiddle">. 
    Find the magnitude of the acceleration that the car will undergo and specify 
    the direction in which the car accelerates.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </span></li>
  <li class="general">If we assign a mass of 1000 kg to the car, calculate the 
    size of the force needed to deflect the car in this circular path (Hint: Use 
    Newton's 2nd Law)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li class="general">In question #5 you calculated the size of the force needed 
    to deflect the car in a circular path. This force is produced by the force 
    of friction between the tires and the road. The road &quot;pushes&quot; the 
    car inward, allowing it to deflect. As long as we can develop enough frictional 
    force we can safely turn the corner. Experiment with the applet and adjust 
    the coefficient of friction. Note how the frictional force changes as you 
    do this. What is the smallest value (approximately) that the coefficient of 
    friction can be to prevent skidding?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><span class="general">Since we know that the force of friction is responsible 
    for deflecting the car inward can equate the force of friction and the inward 
    force. This gives us:<img src="bank_eq21.gif" width="228" height="55" align="absmiddle"> 
    and since on a level surface <img src="bank_eq22.gif" width="68" height="26" align="absmiddle">, 
    we get<img src="bank_eq23.gif" width="103" height="55" align="absmiddle">. 
    This can be simplified to give <img src="bank_eq24.gif" width="66" height="58" align="absmiddle">. 
    Calculate the minimum coefficient of friction for which the car can safely 
    turn the corner. Verify this using the applet.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span class="general">For normal, dry road conditions <font face="Symbol">m</font> 
    = 0.80. Under these conditions what is the fastest safe speed for turning 
    a corner of radius 60.0 m? Does the mass of the car matter?</span></li>

<h2><a name="3"></a>Car on a Vertical Corner! </h2>
<span class="general">What happens if, instead of no bank angle you enter a corner 
banked at 90&deg;! This is definitely in the &quot;don't try this at home&quot; 
category but is a situation sometimes seen at carnivals and exhibitions!</span>
