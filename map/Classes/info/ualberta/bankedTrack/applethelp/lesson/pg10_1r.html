<p><span class="rightanswer">The Normal force will depend on both the bank angle 
  and the speed of the car. For example, the faster you go, the more the car will 
  press down into the road. The Normal Force is the road's reaction back against 
  the car. By the same token, the frictional force will adjust with the Normal 
  Force. However, the Frictional Force will always be less than or equal to the 
  static Frictional Force. Thus, you will occasionally see the Frictional Force 
  remain fixed in size even though N is increasing. </span></p>
