  Car on a Vertical Corner (continued)</h2>
<p><span class="general">Look at the free-body diagram now and notice which force 
  is the inward force. The Normal Force - which is the force that the road exerts 
  on the car - is directed toward the center. So, we can very easily write this 
  as:</span></p>
<p><img src="bank_eq7.gif" width="190" height="56"> </p>
<p><span class="general">Also notice that N depends on the square of the velocity 
  and inversely on the radius of the turn. The faster you go, the greater the 
  force exerted by the road.</span></p>
<p><span class="general">Now, the key question - How fast do you have to go in 
  order to stay &quot;plastered&quot; on the vertical road surface? To answer 
  this again use the applet and look at how the Frictional Force also changes 
  in response to the changing Normal Force. This suggests the answer to our question. 
  The car will not skid as long as the frictional force is equal and opposite 
  to the Weight of the vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="question">Question</p>
<p class="general">What is the equation that would relate the Frictional Force, 
  Normal Force and Weight for the case in which the car does not skid in a vertical 
  turn?</p>
