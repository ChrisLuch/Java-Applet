    Atwood Pulley. Among the concepts that can be studied are the tensions in 
    supporting strings as well as energy and energy conservation concepts.</p>

          but it does provide sufficient information for you to calculate the 
          acceleration of the masses. The information needed to do this is the 
          time t and the distance traveled by mass 1. This data is given in the 
          upper left corner of the drawing panel. As an example, adjust the size 
          of the masses to be 300 g and 700 g respectively (<img src="fig9.png" width="356" height="42" align="absmiddle">). 
          Next press the play button (<img src="fig2a.png" width="19" height="20" align="absmiddle">) 
          and wait. The masses begin to move. Wait until the animation stops. 
          The displacement of mass 1 and the time taken for this appear in the 
          upper left corner of the panel (see bottom figure). </span></li>
        <li><span class="general">In this case the time of motion was 0.760 s

          example, in the previous discussion of acceleration we determined that 
          mass 1 was accelerating upward at 3.92 <span class="general"> m/s<sup>2</sup>.</span> 
          If we use the FBD for mass 1 (shown on the left) and if we assign up
