              Selection Tool <img src="SelectionTool.gif" alt=
              "Selection Tool" align="top">
       </div>
        <p>
          The Selection Tool lets you select any of the circuit
          elements. To use the tool, select it by clicking on it.
          Then click on the circuit element to select that element.
          An information panel below the circuit will display
          information about the selected circuit element and will
          allow you to change parameters defining the element.
        </p>
        <p>
          E.g., if your applet has a circuit with a light bulb,
          like the circuit shown in the snapshot at the top, and if
          you click on the light bulb while the Selection Tool is
          selected, the Tool Information (13) in the snapshot at
          the top will be replaced by information about the light
          bulb, as in the following snapshot.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <img src="BulbInfoPanel.gif" alt="BulbInfoPanel">
        </p>
        <p>
          The greyed-out values are values calculated by the applet
          that cannot be changed directly. The items in the white
          data fields, Nominal Voltage and Nominal Power in this
          case, can be changed by entering new values in the data
          fields (either by typing them or using the up/down arrows
          next to the data field) and subsequently pressing the
          Calculator button at the top of the information panel.
          The button is inactive in the preceding snapshot. It
          becomes active as soon as a new value is entered into one
          of the active data fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          For additional information on how to change the
          parameters defining a circuit element, see Point 4,
          Resistor Tool, below.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you click on a grid point while the Selection Tool is
          selected, the applet displays the electric potential at
          this point. In the following snapshot, the top right
          point in the circuit is selected in this manner. The
          potential at the selected point can be set to any value
          you like by by typing a new value in the Potential data
          entry field or using the up/down arrows next to the data
          field.

          When the Eraser Tool is selected, clicking on any circuit

              Wire Tool <img src="Wire.gif" alt="Wire" align="top">
        </div>
        <p>
          When the Wire Tool is selected, one can create a wire
          segment by clicking with the mouse on a grid point,
          dragging horizontally or vertically to another grid
          point, and then releasing the mouse button. Wires cannot
          be created in a diagonal direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drawing a wire over an existing circuit element, e.g., a
          light bulb, will replace that circuit element by a wire
          segment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quite generally, if a Tool for drawing a circuit element
          is selected, then clicking with the mouse between two
          adjacent grid points will place the circuit element
          between these grid points and replace whatever other
          circuit element may already exist there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Wire Tool works differently from the other Circuit
          Element Tools: placing a wire segment between two grid
          points requires dragging the mouse from one point to the
          other, not just clicking in the space between the grid
          points as is required for the other circuit elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Note</b>. The resistance of a wire segment between two
          adjacent grid points is very, very small, but not zero.
          This resistance cannot be varied by the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tool Information below the circuit area gives the
          resistance of a wire segment between two neighboring grid
          points. See the image at the top which shows the applet
          with the Wire Tool selected.
        </p>

        <a name="Resistor"></a> 
        <div class="sectionheading"><li>
              Resistor Tool <img src="Resistor.gif" alt=
              "Resistor Tool" align="top">
        </div>
        <p>
          When the Resistor Tool is selected, one can place a
          resistor between any two adjacent grid points by clicking
          in the space between the grid points. The grid points
          must be in a horizontal or vertical direction from each
          other, not in a diagonal direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The resistance of the resistor to be placed in the
          circuit can be set in the Resistor Tool Information panel
          below the circuit area:
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <img src="ResistorToolInfo.jpg" alt=
          "Resistor Tool info panel">
        </p>
        <p>
          Set the resistance to the value you want by typing the
          value in the data field or using the up/down scroll
          arrows to the right of the data field. Then click at the
          place in the circuit where you want the resistor to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use the up/down scroll arrows, place the cursor in
          front of the digit you want to change. Then use the
          arrows.
        </p>
        <p>
          To change the resistance of a resistor in the circuit,
          there are two options:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            select the Resistor Tool <img src="Resistor.gif"
                alt="Resistor" align="top">, set the resistance
                value in the Resistor Tool information panel to the
                value you want, and click on the existing resistor;
                the existing resistor will be replaced with a
                resistor that has the new resistance value;
          </li>
          <li>
            select the Selection Tool <img src="SelectionTool.gif"
            alt="Selection Tool" align="top">, then click on the
            resistor whose resistance you want to change, type the
            resistance value you want in the Resistance data field
            in the Resistor information panel below the circuit
            area, and finally click the calculator icon to
            implement the new value and to recalculate the circuit.
            The following snapshot illustrates the Resistor
            Information panel. 
            <p align="center">
              <img src="Resistorpanel.jpg" alt="Resistor Panel">

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Distinguish between the Resistor Tool information panel
          and the Resistor information panel. The preceding two
          images illustrate the two panels. You get the former if
          you select the Resistor Tool and the latter if you select
          the Selection Tool and then select a resistor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The steps described here to change a resistance apply
          correspondingly to other circuit elements and will not be
          repeated below when those elements are described.
        </p>
        <p>
          For information on the values displayed in the Resistor
          information panel, see Point 7, Light Bulb Tool, below
          which displays the same kinds of values.

        <a name="Battery"></a>

              align="top">
        </div>
        <p>
          When the Battery Tool is selected, one can place a
          battery between any two horizontally or vertically
          adjacent grid points by clicking in the space between the
          grid points.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Battery Tool information panel below the circuit area
          has two data entry fields for setting the emf and
          internal resistance of the battery. Set these to the
          values you want. Then insert the battery in the circuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a battery has been inserted into a circuit, you can
          select it after clicking the Selection Tool. The Battery
          information panel will be displayed at the bottom. This
          panel also lets you change the internal resistance and
          emf of the battery. You need to click the Calculator
          button at the top of the panel to implement the values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Changing the parameters of a battery already existing in
          the circuit is accomplished like changing the resistance
          of a resistor. See under Resistor Tool above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both the Battery Tool information panel and the Battery
          information panel have a Switch Polarity button. Clicking
          that will switch the battery's polarity. In the case of
          the button on the Battery Tool information panel,
          clicking this button will have an effect only after
          inserting the next battery into the circuit. This is
          consistent with the way all changed settings in a Tool
          information panel are implemented.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          When the Switch Tool is selected, one can place either an
          open or a closed switch into the circuit, depending on
          whether the Open-Switch radio button in the Switch Tool
          information panel is selected or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just selecting or unselecting the Open-Switch radio
          button in the Switch Tool information panel after a
          switch has been placed in the circuit will not affect the
          state of the switch. Only when a new switch is placed in
          the circuit will the state of the radio button have an
          effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          To change the state of an existing switch, proceed in
          analogy to changing the resistance of a Resistor. See
          under Resistor Tool above.

        <p>
          To insert a light bulb into the circuit, select the Light
          Bulb Tool, set the nominal voltage and nominal power of
          the light bulb (these are the values stamped on a bulb
          when you buy one in the store) to the values you want,
          and click between two horizontally or vertically adjacent
          grid points.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following snapshot shows the Light Bulb Tool panel.

        <p align="center">
          <img src="BulbToolPanel.gif" alt="Bulb Tool Panel">
        </p>
        <p>
          If some circuit parameters get changed, e.g., the emf of
          a battery, so that a light bulb burns out (bulb's
          interior shown black), the light bulb can be replaced
          with a new one. First, however, the problem must be fixed
          that caused the bulb to burn out. E.g., the battery must
          be replaced with another one with a smaller emf. Once
          that is done, select the Light Bulb Tool and click on the
          Change-Burnt-Out-Bulbs button in the Tool panel. A new
          bulb will be inserted into the circuit, with nominal
          voltage and power as specified in the Light Bulb Tool
          panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          To replace an existing bulb in the circuit with another
          one with different design voltage or power, proceed as
          replacing a resistor. See Point 4, Resistor Tool, above.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you select a bulb in a circuit, by clicking on it
          after having selected the Selection Tool, the Light Bulb
          information panel below the circuit area will give you
          information about the bulb. This panel is illustrated in
          the following snapshot.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, the panel lists six values. Four of them
          are greyed out and cannot be directly changed. They are
          calculated by the applet. However, the two values in the
          white data fields can be changed. (See Point 4, Resistor,
          for details.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The values listed have the following interpretation.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>Resistance</u>. Resistance of the bulb.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Current</u>. Current in the bulb.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Voltage Across Bulb</u>. Potential difference
            between the two terminals of the bulb.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Power</u>. Power dissipated in the bulb.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u>Nominal Power</u>. Power rating stamped on the bulb.
            If the bulb is operated at the nominal voltage, the
            nominal power will be the power dissipated in the bulb.
          </li>
          <li>

              The resistance value entered in this panel will apply
              the next time a resistor is placed in the circuit.
              The value entered here affects the operation of the
              <b>Tool</b>. It does <b>not</b> affect the resistance
              of any resistors already in the circuit.

              <u>Resistor Information Panel</u>. When a specific
              resistor already existing in the circuit is selected
              (by clicking on it after selecting the Selection Tool
              <img src="SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection Tool"
              align="top">), the parameters relevant to that

            <p>
              If the resistance value in the data entry field is
              changed and the calculator icon clicked, the
              resistance of the selected resistor is changed
              accordingly and the entire circuit recalculated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only values in a white data entry field can be
              changed. In the case of resistors, only the
              resistance can be changed. The values in the grey
              data fields are calculated values that depend on the
              other parameters in the circuit. Calculated values
              cannot be changed directly.
