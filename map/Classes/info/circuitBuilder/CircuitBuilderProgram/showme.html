      Building a Circuit With Some of the Tools
    </div>
    <p>
      Let's construct a simple circuit and then change some of the
      parameters of the circuit elements.  Carry out the following six
      Exercises in sequence, and carry out only the suggested
      operations.  That way the descriptions below will match what you
      see in the applet.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The six Exercises are organized to illustrate the functions of
      different Tools.  A Tool is accessed by selecting one of the
      buttons on the left of the applet.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a name="Wire"></a><u>Wire Tool</u>. Select the Wire Tool <img
        src="Wire.gif" alt="Wire Tool" align="top"> by clicking on
        it. Construct a rectangular wire loop six grid segments wide
        and five grid segments tall as follows.
        <p>
          Click on a grid point, drag horizontally to the sixth
          grid point, and release the mouse button. Click on the
          last grid point connected, drag vertically to the fifth
          grid point, and release the mouse button. Then draw the
          remaining two sides of the rectangle in similar fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The loop should have the shape shown in Figure 1 below.
        </p>
        <p align="right">

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a name="Battery"></a><u>Battery Tool</u>. Select the Battery
        Tool <img src= "Battery.gif" alt="Battery Tool" align="top">
        and click in the middle segment of the left vertical branch of
        the circuit to insert a battery there. The circuit should look
        as shown in Figure 1 below.  <p align="center"> <img
        src="ShortCircuit.gif" alt="Short Circuit">
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <b>Figure 1</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The wires are shown in red because the circuit is a
          <i>short circuit</i>, which means that there is very
          little resistance in the circuit. This results in a very
          large current and intense heating of the wires. The red
          color is intended to indicate this heating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice the simulated current. The little yellow dots move
          in the direction from the positive pole of the battery
          (long bar of the battery symbol) to the negative pole.
          Since the positive pole is at the bottom of the battery
          in Figure 1, the current direction is counter-clockwise.
          The current direction from the positive to the negative
          pole (or, more generally, from high to low electric
          potential) is the <i>conventional</i> current direction.
          Positive charge carriers would move in this direction.
        </p>
        <p align="right">
          <a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" alt="Back to Top"

      </li>
      <li>
        <a name="Display"></a><u>Display Tool</u>. What is actually
        moving in a metal wire is negatively charged electrons. Their
        direction of motion is opposite to the conventional current
        direction.  To reset the applet so that it simulates the
        direction in which the electrons move, select the Display Tool
        <img src="Display.jpg" alt="Display Tool" align="top"> and
        select "Electron" from the Animation-of-Current drop-down menu
        on the Display Tool information panel below the circuit
        area. That will result in a current direction from the
        negative to the positive battery pole.
        <p>
          You can also turn the current animation off by selecting
          "None". Figure 2 shows the drop-down menu in the Display
          Tool information panel.

          When the drop-down menu in the Display Tool information
          panel is not opened up, the panel looks as in Figure 3
          below.

          The "Minimum Current to Animate" is the threshold current
          for a circuit element below which the current in that
          element will not be animated. The "Maximum Current Before
          Short" is the maximum current in a wire segment for which
          the segment will be shown in black. If the current in a
          segment is larger than that, the segment will be shown in
          red as in Figure 1 above. You can reset these threshold
          values by typing new values in the data fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          Click "Hide All Values" and observe that the 5-V label of
          the battery disappears. Click "Show All Values" to make
          it reapper.
        </p>
        <p>
          The radio button "Display Values When Adding Object" acts
          only on objects to be added. Deselect this button, and
          then add a resistor to the circuit, by selecting the
          Resistor Tool <img src="Resistor.gif" alt="Resistor Tool"
          align="top"> and clicking on a wire segment in the
          circuit. The resistance value will not be displayed. Then
          select the Display Tool and click "Show All Values". The
          resistance of the resistor will be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that the wires change to black when the resistor
          is inserted. The short circuit exists no longer. Restore
          the short circuit by replacing the resistor with a wire
          element. To do so, select the Wire Tool and drag over the
          resistor from the grid point on one side of the resistor
          to the grid point on the other side.

        <a name="Select"></a><u>Selection Tool</u>. The applet lets
        you switch the polarity of the battery. To do so, click on the
        Selection Tool <img src="SelectionTool.gif" alt="Selection

        to select it, then click on the Switch-Polarity button on the
        Battery Information panel below the circuit area.
        <p>
          Notice how the current direction is reversed when the
          battery polarity is reversed.

        <a name="Bulb"></a><u>Light Bulb Tool</u>. Select the Light
        Bulb Tool <img src= "Bulb.jpg" alt="Bulb Tool" align="top">,
        and click in the middle segment of the vertical branch on the
        right to insert a light bulb there. The light bulb should burn
        and the short circuit should cease to exist, so that the wires
        are shown in black. Compare to Figure 4 below.  <p

        </p>
        <p>
          Select the Selection Tool, and then select the light bulb in
          the circuit by clicking on it. Notice that the Light Bulb
          information panel below the circuit area indicates that the
          nominal voltage of the light bulb is 10 V. (For a
          store-bought bulb, the "nominal voltage" is the voltage
          written on the bulb.) See Figure 5 below.

          <b>Figure 5</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the battery has an emf of only 5 V. Therefore,
          the light bulb is running at too low a voltage and,
          indeed, the applet shows it to be quite dim (short yellow
          rays).
        </p>
        <p>
          Reset the battery emf to 10 V. To do so, click on the
          battery with the mouse after selecting the Selection Tool.
          The Battery information panel will open up, with an emf data
          entry field at the bottom. See Figure 6 below.  Change the
          emf from 5 V to 10 V in the EMF data entry field, and then
          click the calculator icon. Figure 6 shows the panel after
          the emf has been reset to 10 V.  Observe that the bulb now
          burns brighter.

        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that some data fields in the Battery information
          panel are in grey, others in white. The ones in grey
          indicate calculated values that cannot be set in this panel,
          because they depend on other parameters. The ones in white,
          the internal resistance and the emf of the battery, can be
          changed in this panel by typing new values in these data
          fields or by using the up/down arrows next to the data
          fields. To implement the new values, click the calculator
          icon.  Don't make any changes other than the ones requested
          here before completing all six Exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Select the light bulb again and change its nominal voltage
          from 10 V to 5 V so that the 10-V battery will be
          applying <b>too much</b> voltage to the bulb. Observe
          that now the bulb burns even brighter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The applet is designed so that a bulb will burn out when
          the voltage applied to it is four times or more the
          nominal voltage of the bulb. Try to burn out the bulb this
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          To replace the burnt-out light bulb, you can select the
          Light Bulb Tool, which will open the Light Bulb Tool
          panel shown in Figure 7 below. For details, please see
          Number 7 under Help.

        <a name="Resistor"></a><u>Resistor Tool and Switch
        Tool</u>. In the previously constructed circuit, set the
        battery emf to 10 V and the nominal voltage and power of the
        light bulb to 10 V and 10 W, respectively.  The light bulb
        will have a resistance of 10 <font face=
        "symbol">W</font>. Check this by selecting the Selection Tool and
        clicking on the bulb. The Light Bulb information panel will provide
        this information.
        <p>
          Then add a circuit branch parallel to the light bulb as
          shown in Figure 8 below. First draw the wires with the
          Wire Tool selected. This will result in a short circuit
          in the parallel branch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then insert an open switch into the new branch. Do so by
          selecting the Switch Tool <img src="Switch.jpg" alt="Switch
          Tool" align= "top"> and then clicking on the wire segment
          where you want to insert the switch. Make sure the "Open
          Switch" radio button in the Switch Tool panel is selected
          before inserting the switch. Once the open switch is
          inserted, the short circuit is broken and the wires should
          again be in black, without any current.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally insert a 10-<font face="symbol">W</font> resistor
          into the parallel branch, by selecting the Resistor Tool
          <img src="Resistor.gif" alt="Resistor Tool" align="top">,
          making sure the resistance in the Resistor Tool panel is
          set to 10 <font face="symbol">W</font>, and clicking on
          the wire segment where you want the resistor to be. The
          final circuit should look as in Figure 8 below.

          Will the bulb burn less bright than before?

        <p>
          Find out by selecting the Selection Tool, clicking on the
          switch, and then unclicking the "Open Switch" radio
          button in the Switch information panel. The switch will
          close. You should find that there is no change in the
          bulb's brightness and that there is now current in the
          branch containing the resistor.

      <u>Potential</u>. If you still have the circuit in your
      applet that is shown in Figure 8, erase the parallel branch
      containing the resistor and switch. Do this by selecting the
      Eraser Tool <img src="Eraser.gif" alt="Eraser Tool" align=

      branch.

    <p>
      Make sure the battery emf is set to 10 V, and change the
      battery polarity if necessary so that the positive terminal
      (long bar) of the battery is on top. Make sure the nominal
      voltage and power of the light bulb are set to 10 V and 10 W,
      respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the Selection Tool, and click on the grid point at the
      top right corner of the circuit directly above the bulb.  The
      applet will display the electric potential at this point.  It
      should read 0 V. This value can be set arbitrarily. Set it to +5
      V using the data field in the Point information panel.  You
      should get the display shown in Figure 9 below.

      What potential do you expect to have at some circuit point
      below the bulb? Click at such a grid point and observe. You
      should find -5 V if the polarity of the battery is as shown
      in Figure 9. The potential <b>difference</b> across the bulb
      should be equal to the battery terminal voltage: 5 V - (-5 V)
      = 10 V.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Potential Difference</u>. You can determine the potential
      difference across a circuit element with a voltmeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connect a voltmeter in parallel with the bulb as shown in
      Figure 10 below.

    <p>
      The voltmeter should indicate 10 V.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the internal resistance of the voltmeter is set to
      infinity. This corresponds to an ideal voltmeter in which
      zero current is in the loop containing the meter and the
      meter has zero disturbing influence on the conditions in the
      circuit that it is supposed to measure. Real voltmeters have
      a large, but finite resistance. You can simulate this by
      entering a finite resistance value in the Voltmeter Tool
      panel before inserting the meter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Current</u>. The applet tells you what the current is in a
      circuit element if you select the Selection Tool and click on
      the element. Do this for a wire segment in the main branch of
      the circuit containing the bulb. The Wire information panel
      should look as shown in Figure 11 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    <p>
      It indicates that the current in the segment is 1 A.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note the last row in the panel labeled "Current Direction".  The
      three buttons in this row do <b>not</b> let you switch the
      simulated current from conventional to electron current as is
      done by the Display Tool. Instead, the two buttons with arrows
      let you assign a direction to a wire element that will be taken
      as the positive direction in performing calculations involving
      currents. Clicking the button with the icon "-" removes the
      direction indicators.  Observe what happens when you alternately
      click the three buttons.  The actual current direction animated
      by the applet is unaffected by this wire direction.
    </p>

      To measure the current in a wire segment, insert an ammeter into
      this section. Select the Ammeter Tool and click on a wire
      segment in the main branch of the circuit. The result should
      look as shown in Figure 12 below.

      The ammeter reads 1 A, confirming the earlier determination.
      Note the very low internal resistance of the ammeter
      indicated in the Ammeter Tool panel. An ideal ammeter would
      have zero resistance, thus causing zero disturbance of the
      conditions present in the circuit. Real ammeters will usually
      have larger resistance values than the applet's default
      resistance of 10<sup>-9</sup> <font face="symbol">W</font>.
      You can change the internal resistance by entering another
      value in the data field of the Ammeter Tool panel before
      inserting the meter into the circuit.
