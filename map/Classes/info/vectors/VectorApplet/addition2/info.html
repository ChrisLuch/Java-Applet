  Vector Tool</a></div>

  <p>To draw a vector, select the Vector tool <img src="vector.gif"
  align="top">; then click in the applet window and draw with the
  mouse.  You can change the vector by dragging either its tail or its
  tip.  You can move the vector without changing it by clicking it
  somewhere near its middle and dragging it.

  <p>To draw a second vector, repeat the procedure, beginning with the
  selection of the Vector tool.</li>

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="DottedLine"><img src="dottedline.gif" align="top">
  Dotted Line Tool</a></div>

  <p>To draw a dotted line, select the Dotted-Line tool <img
  src="dottedline.gif" align="top">; then click in the applet window
  and draw with the mouse.

  <p>You can change a dotted line by dragging either its tail or its
tip.  You can move the line without changing it by clicking it
somewhere near its middle and dragging it.

  <p>The Dotted-Line tool does not become active until Page 3 when you
  are asked to draw the resultant of the two vectors.  It can help you
  in constructing the resultant by the parallegram method, as
  illustrated in the figure at the top.</li>

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="Delete"><img src="Delete.gif" align="top">
  Delete Tool</a></div>

  <p>You can delete any vector or dotted line that you have drawn by
  selecting the Delete tool <img src="Delete.gif" align="top"> and
  then clicking on the vector or dotted line.</li>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif"

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="Resultant">Answer</a></div>

  <p>The correct resultant vector (sum) will be drawn automatically (in
  green) when you go to Page 4.  The program will let you advance to
  Page 4 only after you have drawn your resultant (in blue) on
  Page 3 by means of the vector tool.

  <p>You can drag either the green or the blue resultant vectors by
  clicking on them somewhere near their midpoints and then dragging
  them.</li>
