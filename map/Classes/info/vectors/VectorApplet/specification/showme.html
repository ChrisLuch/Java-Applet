Vector</a></div>

  <p>When the applet is loaded, it will already display a vector.
  You should see a vector similar to the one shown below, although
  with somewhat different magnitude and slightly different direction.

  <p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsPolar.jpg"></p>

  <p>Make sure that the radio button labeled "Polar (positive)" is
  selected, as in the snapshot.

  <p><b>Exercise 1</b>. Change the vector to a vector of magnitude
  close to 200 and with a direction angle close to 200<sup>o</sup>, by
  working with the arrow.  (You will probably not be able to get these
  values exactly, but you should be able to get a vector in a
  magnitude range from 199 to 201 and an angle range from
  199<sup>o</sup> to 201<sup>o</sup>.

  <p>To change the arrow, click either on its tip or tail and drag.
  You may need to move the arrow to another location, without changing
  its magnitude or direction.  To do so, click near the middle of the
  arrow and drag.

  <p>When done, you should have a display similar to that shown in the
  following snapshot. The two data fields in the control panel display
  the magnitude of the vector and the angle.

  <p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecs200.jpg"></p>

  <p>Note that the magnitude shown in the data field is measured in
  pixels.

  <p><b>Exercise 2</b>. Change the vector to a vector of magnitude
  140.00 and angle 130.75<sup>o</sup> by working with the data fields
  in the control panel.  Type this pair of values in the two data
  fields, then press ENTER on the keyboard.  You should see the
  display shown in the next snapshot.

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="FourWays">Four Ways of Specifying a Vector</a></div>

<p>The applet works with vectors in two dimensions.  Two numbers are
needed to specify a vector in two dimensions.  There is no unique way
to choose this pair of numbers.  The applet offers you four different
kinds of number pairs that all can be used to specify a vector in two
dimensions.  The four possibilities are accessed by clicking the
appropriate radio button in the control panel.  

<p>The following exercises will let you work with each of these
possibilities.

<p><ol>

<li><a name="Polar(pos)"><u>Polar (positive)</u></a>.

<p><b>Exercise 3</b>.  Click the radio button labeled "Polar
(positive)", as in the following snapshot.  

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsPolar.jpg"></p>

<p>In this mode, the vector is specified by its polar coordinates:
magnitude and direction angle.  The direction angle is taken between
the vector and the 'East' direction, indicated by a dotted line.  All
angles are positive between 0 and 360<sup>0</sup>, increasing in the
positive (counter-clockwise) sense starting at the reference
line. Notice the arc indicating the angle.

<p>The magnitude of the vector shown in the control panel is in
pixels. This is true in all four modes.</li>

<p>Exercise 2 above already asks you to set a vector using this mode.
In the present Exercise, let's do something different.  Position the
tail end of the vector as near to the center of the applet window as
possible, by clicking on the vector somewhere near its middle and
dragging.  Then click on the tip of the vector and adjust the vector's
magnitude to close to 150.  Finally, by dragging the vector's tip in a
counter-clockwise direction, change the vector so that its direction
angle keeps on increasing while the vector's magnitude stays roughly
equal to 150.

<p>Observe that the angle will eventually reach 360<sup>o</sup> and
then restart at 0<sup>o</sup> as you continue dragging the tip
counter-clockwise.</li>

<p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<li><a name="Polar(posneg)"><u>Polar (positive and negative)</u></a>.

<p><b>Exercise 4</b>.  Click the radio button labeled "Polar (pos &
neg)", as in the following snapshot.  Notice that the angle has a
negative value, -35.79<sup>o</sup>.

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsPolarneg.jpg"></p>

<p>Again, position the tail end of the vector as near to the center of
the applet window as possible.  In the data fields, set the magnitude
and angle equal to 150 and 0, respectively.  You should get a display
like in the following snapshot, except that here the tail end of the
vector is not quite in the middle of the applet window.

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecs0deg.jpg"></p>

<p>Drag the vector's tip in a counter-clockwise direction while
keeping the vector's magnitude roughly equal to 150.  Observe that the
angle keeps on increasing up to 180<sup>o</sup>, at which point it
suddenly jumps to -180<sup>o</sup> and then goes on decreasing to
0<sup>o</sup> until you are back at the starting point shown above.
Then change the vector away from 0<sup>o</sup>, this time rotating it
in the negative (<b>clockwise</b>) direction.  Observe that the angles
are becoming more negative up to -180<sup>o</sup>, at which point the
angle jumps to +180<sup>o</sup> and then decreases from there on.

<p><b>Exercise 5</b>.  Set a vector with magnitude equal to 150 and
angle equal to -120<sup>o</sup>.  Then click the Polar (positive)
button.  The angle in the data field should change to 240<sup>o</sup>.
Then switch back to Polar (pos & neg).  Notice how the arc indicating
the angle between the vector and the dotted reference line jumps.</li>

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsposneg.jpg"></p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<p>

<li><a name="Navigational"><u>Navigational</u></a>.

<p><b>Exercise 6</b>.  Click the radio button labeled "Navigational",
as in the following snapshot.  The angle is shown as
215.79<sup>o</sup> NofW (North of West). 

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsNav.jpg"></p>

<p>Set the vector in your applet to the same angle and compass
direction.  To change the compass direction, click on the compass
direction that is displayed in the control panel of your applet.
This will open up a drop-down menu.  Select "NofW" from this menu.

<p>Notice that when "NofW" is chosen the dotted line runs 'west' from
the tail end of the vector.  Angles are now defined starting from this
west direction and are measured positive from west towards north,
i.e., in the clockwise sense.  Angles can increase up to
360<sup>o</sup> continuing clockwise from the west direction.  E.g.,
the angle in the snapshot above is 215.79<sup>o</sup>.  Notice how the
arc indicates this angle starting from the west direction and going
clockwise from there to the vector.

<p>On a sheet of paper, draw your present vector and then draw its
angle corresponding to the direction "SofE".  Also predict the
magnitude of the angle.  Then check your prediction by selecting
"SofE".  The following snapshot shows the angle.</li>

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsSofE.jpg"></p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<p>

<li><a name="Cartesian"><u>Cartesian <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
components</u></a>.

<p><b>Exercise 7</b>.  Click the radio button labeled "Cartesian
(<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>)", as in the following
snapshot.

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsCart.jpg"></p>

<p>The vector <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> is specified by its
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> (scalar) components
(<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) relative to a pair of
horizontal (<i>x</i>) and vertical (<i>y</i>) axes.  The
<i>x</i>-component is shown in green, and the <i>y</i>-component in
yellow.

<p>Change the vector by dragging either its tip or its tail end and
observe how the components change, both their graphical
representations and their values in the data fields.

<p>Try to change the vector by dragging in such a way that either only
its <i>x</i> or its <i>y</i> component changes.

<p>Observe in what quadrant the vector must be for its components to
be positive or negative.</li>
