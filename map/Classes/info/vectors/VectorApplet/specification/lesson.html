<p>

<div class="sectionheading">The applet draws a two-dimensional vector
that has been specified numerically</div>

<hr noshade color="#C0C0C0">

<p><b>Prerequisites</b>

<p>Students need to have a basic knowledge of angles, and for the last
part of the lesson need to be able to use the Pythagorean theorem and
basic trigonometry.

<p><b>Learning Outcomes</b>

<p>Students will develop an understanding of different ways of
specifying vectors in two dimensions: by magnitude and direction (in
three different ways) or by components.

<p><b>Instructions</b>

<p>Students should know how the applet functions, as described in Help
and ShowMe.

<p>The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in the
following text are to be done in the applet. You may need to toggle
back and forth between instructions and applet if your screen space is
limited.

<div class="sectionheading"><a name = "MagnitudeDirection">The Magnitude and
Direction of a Vector</a></div>

<p>To specify a vector in two dimensions, one needs to specify two
numbers (scalars).  There are many possibilities for doing this.
Let's start by using a vector's magnitude and direction and compare
different ways of doing that.  

<p>There is only one way to specify the magnitude or absolute value of
a vector.  However, there are a variety of ways to specify direction.
Direction is often specified in terms of an angle, but there are
different ways of choosing an angle for a given vector.  Here we will
consider three possibilities.

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<ol>

<a name="Polar(pos)"></a><p><li><u>Polar (positive)</u>. Choose the
"Polar (positive)" mode in the control panel of the applet and enter
150 for the magnitude and 240<sup>o</sup> for the angle.  You should
get the display shown in Figure 1 below.

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecs240.jpg"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

<p>In this mode, an angle is measured from a reference line, shown
dotted and pointing east, in the positive (counter-clockwise) sense
that is indicated by the arc.  Angles can range from 0 to
360<sup>o</sup>.  360<sup>o</sup> is equivalent to 0<sup>o</sup>.</li>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<a name="Polar(posneg)"></a><p><li><u>Polar (positive &
negative)</u>. In the mode that is called "Polar (pos & neg)" in the
applet, angles are defined differently.  The same reference line
is used, pointing horizontally to the right.  However, both positive
and negative angles are used, positive angles for vectors pointing
somewhere above and negative angles for vectors pointing somewhere
below the horizontal axis.  Starting from 0<sup>o</sup>, the angle
increases (decreases) to 180<sup>o</sup> (-180<sup>o</sup>) as the
vector rotates in the positive (negative) sense.  180<sup>o</sup> and
-180<sup>o</sup> both specify a vector pointing horizontally to the
left.

<p><b>Question</b>.  What would be the angle for the vector in Figure
1 according to the "Polar (pos & neg)" method?  Draw the angle with an
arc in your Notebook.

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The answer is -120<sup>o</sup>.  See the diagram in
Figure 2 below.

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsneg120.jpg"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

<p>Verify this by selecting the "Polar (pos & neg)" mode in your applet.

<p><b>Exercise</b>.  Use the applet to set vectors that point into the
first, second, third, and fourth quadrants.  For each vector, select
the Polar (positive) mode first.  Predict what the angle should be in
the Polar (pos & neg) mode, and then check your answer by selecting
that mode.</li>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<a name="Navigational"></a><p><li><u>Navigational</u>. Angles can also
be specified relative to compass directions. Click the applet's radio
button labeled "Navigational", and choose "NofE" (North of East) from
among the eight compass directions on the drop-down menu.  Assuming
the vector is still set to that from Figures 1 and 2, you should see
the display in Figure 3 below.

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsNofE.jpg"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 3</b></p>

<p>"North of East" means that the angle is measured starting from the
east direction and going towards the north direction, but not
necessarily stopping there.  In the present example, the angle goes
all the way past the west direction.

<p><b>Question</b>.  What do you expect the angle will be for the same
vector if you choose "SofE" (South of East)?  Make a prediction and
then check it.  You should get the display in Figure 4 below.

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsSofE120.jpg"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 4</b></p>

<p>Note that the angle is +120<sup>o</sup>, not -120<sup>o</sup>.
In the Navigational mode, angles are by definition positive and range
from 0 to 360<sup>o</sup>.

<p><b>Exercise</b>.  Predict the values for the angle for each of the
remaining six navigational settings for the present vector.  Then use
the applet to check your predictions.</li>

</ol>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif" border ="0"
align="top"></a></p>

<p><div class="sectionheading"><a name="Cartesian">Cartesian
  <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> Components</a></div>

<p>If you have changed the vector, reset it to that shown in any of
Figures 1 to 4.  Then click the radio button labeled "Cartesian
(<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>)".  You should see the
display in Figure 5 below.

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsCartesian.jpg"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 5</b></p>

<p>The projections of the vector onto the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes,
shown in green and yellow, respectively, are called the <i>scalar
components</i> of the vector.  They are called <b>scalar</b>
components because they are numbers.  The scalar components are equal
to the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of the tip of the vector if
the tail end of the vector is at the origin of the coordinate system,
as it is here.

<p>The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> scalar components of a vector <img
src="v.gif" align="bottom"> are denoted <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> and
<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>, respectively.  In the present case, this pair of
components has the value

<p align="center">(<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) =
(-75,-129.90) <img src="small.gif" width="40" height="1"> (1)</p>

<p>You can use the notation
(<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) to denote the vector <img
src="v.gif" align="bottom">, because the vector is fully specified in
terms of its two scalar components.  Thus, when you are required to
calculate a vector <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> you can give your
final answer in the form of Equation (1) above.  This is quite
alright.  There is no need to calculate the magnitude and direction of
the vector.  The magnitude and direction contain no more information
than the components.

<p>Or you could state your final answer in the form

<p align="center"><img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> = (-75,-129.90) . <img
src="small.gif" width="40" height="1"> (2)</p>

<p>However, when describing a vector by its two components, it must be
understood from the context how the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes are
defined.  Otherwise, you must explicitly state how they are defined.

<p><b>Question</b>.  Given the magnitude and direction of a vector,
how can one calculate the vector's
(<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) components, for a given
pair of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes?

<p>Let's answer this by doing the calculation for the present vector.
The first thing to do is to make a diagram showing the relevant
quantities.  Such a diagram is shown in Figure 6 below.

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsCompcalc.jpg"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 6</b></p>

<p>The diagram shows a right-angle triangle containing the vector <img
src="v.gif" align="bottom"> as its hypotenuse, with the other two
sides equal to <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>, or
rather, equal to their magnitudes |<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>| and
|<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>| (since <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> and
<i>v<sub>y</sub></i> are both negative in the present case).  The
angle <font face="symbol">a</font> defines the orientation of <img
src="v.gif" align="bottom">.  We need to know this angle.

<p>Let's assume <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> is given according to
mode "Polar (positive)", as in Figure 1.  Then the angle extending
from the positive <i>x</i>-axis to <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> in
the positive sense is equal to 240<sup>o</sup>.  This implies <font
face="symbol">a</font> = 60<sup>o</sup>.  The magnitude <i>v</i> of
the vector is 150.

<p>Basic trigonometry gives |<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>|/<i>v</i> = sin <font
face="symbol">a</font> whence

<p align="center">|<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>| = <i>v</i> sin <font
face="symbol">a</font> = 150 x sin 60<sup>o</sup> = 129.90 .  <img
src="small.gif" width="20" height="1"> (3)
</p>

<p>Figure 6 shows that <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> is negative.  Therefore,

<p align="center"><i>v<sub>y</sub></i> = -129.90 . <img
src="small.gif" width="40" height="1"> (4)</p>

<p>Similarly, from |<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>|/<i>v</i> = cos <font
face="symbol">a</font> it follows that

<p align="center">|<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>| = <i>v</i> cos <font
face="symbol">a</font> = 150 x cos 60<sup>o</sup> = 75.00 . <img
src="small.gif" width="20" height="1"> (5)</p>

<p>Figure 6 shows that <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> is negative.  Therefore,

<p align="center"><i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = -75.00 . <img
src="small.gif" width="40" height="1"> (6)</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  Given the values of the scalar components of <img
src="v.gif" align="bottom"> as in Equations (4) and (6), how can one
calculate the magnitude and direction of <img src="v.gif"
align="bottom">?

<p><b>Answer</b>.  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right-angle
triangle in Figure 6, we get 

<p align="center"><i>v<sup>2</sup></i> =
<i>v<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup></i> + <i>v<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup></i> =
(-75)<sup>2</sup> + (-129.9)<sup>2</sup> = 22,499 <img src="small.gif"
width="20" height="1"> (7)</p>

whence

<p align="center"><i>v</i> = 150.00 . <img src="small.gif" width="40"
height="1"> (8)</p>

<p>Applying the definition of the tangent to the right-angle triangle
in Figure 6 gives

<p align="center">tan <font face="symbol">a</font> =
|<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>|/|<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>| = 129.9/75 = 1.732 <img
src="small.gif" width="40" height="1"> (9)</p>

whence

<p align="center"> <font face="symbol">a</font> = 60<sup>o</sup> <img
src="small.gif" width="40" height="1"> (10)</p>

whence

<p align="center"><font face="symbol">q</font> = 60<sup>o</sup> S of W
= 240<sup>o</sup> N of E. <img src="small.gif" width="40" height="1">
