  <li><a name="Vector">Changing the Vector</a></div>

  <p>When the applet is loaded, it will already display a vector.  You
  can change the vector either by changing the arrow or by changing
  the values in the data field at the bottom of the applet. 

  <p>To change the arrow, click either on its tip or tail and drag.
  To move the arrow without changing its magnitude or direction,
  click near the middle of the arrow and drag.

  <p>The two data fields in the control panel display the magnitude of
  the vector and the angle between the vector and the dotted reference
  line.  (This is assuming you are still in the default display mode.
  See Point 3 below for the other modes.)

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsvector.jpg"></p>

<p>Instead of changing the vector by dragging the arrow, you can
change it by typing a different pair of values in the two data entry
fields, followed by pressing ENTER on the keyboard.  </li>

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="Refline">Reference Line </a></div>

  <p>The dotted line is a reference line relative to which the angle
  specifying the vector is measured.  The angle is indicated by an
  arc.</li>

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="Format">Four Ways of Specifying a Vector</a></div>

<p>The applet works with vectors in two dimensions.  Two numbers are
needed to specify a vector in two dimensions.  The applet lets you
choose from four different kinds of pairs of numbers to specify a
vector.</p>

<ul>

<li><u>Polar (positive)</u>.  

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsPolar.jpg"></p>


<p>The vector is specified by its polar coordinates: magnitude and
direction angle.  The direction angle is taken between the vector and
the 'East' direction, indicated by a dotted line.  All angles are
positive between 0 and 360<sup>0</sup>, increasing in the positive
(counter-clockwise) sense starting at the reference line.

<p>The magnitude of the vector is in pixels, in all four methods.</li>

<p>

<li><u>Polar (pos & neg)</u>. 

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsPolarneg.jpg"></p>

<p>Same as Polar (positive), but the angles are taken to be in the
range from -180<sup>0</sup> to 180<sup>0</sup>.  The angle is negative
if the vector points to a point below the horizontal axis, as in the
example above.  It is positive if the vector points to a point above
the horizontal axis.</li>

<p>

<li><u>Navigational</u>.  

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsNav.jpg"></p>

<p>Same as for Polar (positive), but the angles are taken relative to
one of the four compass directions, either in the clockwise or
counter-clockwise sense.  In the present example, the angle is
specified by "N of W", which means the angle is measured between West
(dotted line) and the vector, the angle being defined as going in the
direction from West to North, i.e., clockwise.

<p>There are eight such modes of specifying an angle, from east of
north (E of N), north of east (N of E), all the way to west of north
(W of N).

<p>The mode can be selected from a drop-down menu that becomes
available when the Navigational method is chosen.  All angles range
from 0 to 360<sup>0</sup>.</li>

<p>

<li><u>Cartesian (<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>)</u>.  

<p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsCart.jpg"></p>

<p>The vector <img src="v.gif" align="bottom"> is specified by its
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> (scalar) components
(<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) relative to a pair of
horizontal (<i>x</i>) and vertical (<i>y</i>) axes.  The
<i>x</i>-component is shown in green, and the <i>y</i>-component in
yellow.</li>

</ul>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><img src="top.gif"
border="0"></a></p>

<p>

  <div class="sectionheading">
  <li><a name="DataFields">Data Fields</a></div>

  <p align="center"><img src="VectorSpecsDatafields.jpg"></p>

  <p>The two data fields show the number pair that specifies the
  vector.  A given vector is specified by a different number pair in
  each of the four modes described in Point 3 above.  The way the two
  numbers in each pair are to be interpreted is indicated by the
  preceding symbolic description.  E.g., in the present example, the
  symbolic expression (<i>v</i>,<i><font face="symbol">q</font></i>)
  precedes the two data fields.  Thus, in this case, the first entry
  is equal to <i>v</i> and the second entry equal to <i><font
  face="symbol">q</font></i>.

  <p>You can change the vector by typing new values into the data
  fields, followed by pressing ENTER on the keyboard, or by dragging
  the tip or tail of the vector.  In the latter case, the data entry
  fields are updated automatically as you change the vector.</li>
