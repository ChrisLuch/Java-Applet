      <b>Prerequisites</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the section on units, students should be familiar with
      the units of basic physical quantities. For the sections on
      Kepler's laws, no special physics background is required. For
      the concluding section on some of the underlying physics and
      on the special unit system used in the Lesson, students
      should be familiar with the concepts of force, acceleration,
      speed, angular speed and the radian measure of angles, and be
      familiar with Newton's second law, Newton's law of universal
      gravitation, and acceleration in uniform circular motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Learning Outcomes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students will develop an understanding of Kepler's three laws
      of planetary motion and will deepen their understanding of
      some of the related dynamics and kinematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Students should know how the applet functions, as described
      in Help and ShowMe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions in
      the following text are to be done in the applet. You may need
      to toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if
      your screen space is limited.

      Observe that the various quantities are displayed in units
      involving the units "AU" and "Year". These are convenient
      units in an astronomical context.
    </p>
    <p>
      The AU is the <i>astronomical unit</i>. It is a unit of
      distance and is equal to the semi-major axis of the earth's
      orbit around the sun. 1 AU = 1.496&times;10<sup>11</sup> m.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Year is the time it takes the earth to make one
      revolution around the sun relative to the fixed stars. This
      is also called the the <i>sidereal year</i>. 1 Year = 365.26
      mean solar days. The sidereal year must be distinguished from
      the calendar year which is equal to 365 or 366 mean solar
      days, depending on the particular year. It must also be
      distinguished from the <i>tropical year</i> and the
      <i>anomalistic year</i> which do not concern us in this
      applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Make a dimensional analysis of all
      quantities listed in Figure 1, and determine if the units
      shown are dimensionally correct. E.g., speed has the
      dimensions of length/time. This is consistent with the unit
      AU/Year displayed for speed in Figure 1.

    <div class="sectionheading">
      Kepler's Three Laws of Planetary Motion
    </div>
    <p>
      Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) worked out three laws of
      planetary motion. These laws describe the manner in which the
      planets move around the sun. They do not explain <b>why</b>
      the planets move in this fashion. That explanation was
      provided later by Isaac Newton (1642-1727).
    </p>
    <p>
      Kepler's three laws were based on observations by Tycho Brahe
      (1546-1601). They amounted to a great simplification and
      increased accuracy in the description of the planets' motions
      compared to the earlier Copernican model. This advance was
      brought about when Kepler realized that planets were moving
      in elliptical orbits, rather than on epicycles of circles as
      in the Copernican model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kepler's laws are now known to be true only to an
      approximation, but a very good one. The observed deviations
      of the planets' motions from Kepler's laws can for the most
      part be explained in terms of Newton's laws of motion applied
      to the planets in combination with his universal law of
      gravitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Newtonian analysis shows that Kepler's laws would be true
      exactly if the gravitational force exerted on the planets by
      the sun were the only force acting on the planets. However,
      the planets also exert gravitational forces on each other,
      and it is these additional small forces that cause the
      planets' motions to be slightly different from those
      predicted by Kepler's laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newton's theory can explain these deviations from Kepler's
      laws, except for one remaining small discrepancy which was
      accounted for early in the twentieth century by Einstein's
      theory of general relativity.

      respectively. PLAY the motion.

    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. Just eye-balling the way the planet
      (green) is moving around the sun (yellow), how would you
      describe the shape of the orbit and the location of the sun
      relative to the orbit?
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on the most precise observations available at the time,
      made by the astronomer Tycho Brahe, Kepler described the
      orbits of all planets in his first law.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <b>Kepler's first law</b>. The orbit of a planet around the
      sun is an ellipse, with the sun located at one of the two
      focal points of the ellipse.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 1</u>. An ellipse is a curve such that for any
      point P on this curve the sum of the distances
      <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>r<sub>2</sub></i> from P to two
      fixed points F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> is constant. The
      fixed points F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> are called the
      <i>focal points</i> of the ellipse. The sum of the two
      distances <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>r<sub>2</sub></i> obeys
      the equation
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>r<sub>2</sub></i> = 2<i>a</i>
      <img src="images/small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width=
      "40"> (2)
    </p>
    <p>
      where 2<i>a</i> is the length of the major axis of the
      ellipse, the longest diameter of the ellipse. Figure 2 below
      illustrates these quantities.

      Kepler's Second Law

      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Continuing from the previous section,
      REWIND the applet. Display the sectors of equal area by
      clicking the Area Sweep button <img src="images/Sweep.gif"
      alt="Area Sectors" align="top">.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the time values from the data box, measure the times
      required for the planet to traverse several of these sectors
      of equal area, one sector at a time. What do you observe?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>. Kepler, based on Brahe's observations,
      provided an answer to this question in his second law.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <b>Kepler's second law</b>. In equal time intervals, the
      radius vector from the sun to a planet sweeps across equal
      areas.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 1</u>. One can also state this law by saying that
      a planet's areal speed is constant. <i>Areal speed</i> is
      defined as the <b>limit</b> of the ratio <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>A</i>/<font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>t</i> as <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>t</i> goes to zero. Here <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>A</i> is the area swept over by the
      radius vector from the sun to the planet during the time
      interval <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>. We'll use the
      symbol <i>dA</i>/<i>dt</i> for areal speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 2</u>. Most books use the term "areal velocity"
      rather than "areal speed" to refer to <i>dA</i>/<i>dt</i>.
      For consistency's sake, since <i>dA</i>/<i>dt</i> is a
      positive scalar quantity, not a vector, let's call it "areal
      speed".

      Kepler's Third Law
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. Continuing from the previous section, hide
      the sectors of equal area. Measure the period of the planet.
      Repeat this for another orbit with the same semi-major axis,
      but different eccentricity. Repeat this for yet another orbit
      with different semi-major axis, and again for a fourth orbit
      with the same semi-major axis as the last one but different
      eccentricity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, measure the period for two pairs of orbits. The orbits
      of each pair have the same semi-major axis but different
      eccentricity. Based on your observations, answer the
      following questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1</b>. How does varying the eccentricity affect
      the period?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 2</b>. For each orbit, what is the value of the
      ratio <i>T</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>a</i><sup>3</sup> where
      <i>T</i> is the period?
    </p>
    <p>
      Kepler, based on Brahe's observations, answered these
      questions in his <b>third law</b>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      For all planet orbits, the square of the period is
      proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <u>Comment 1</u>. In the units of AU and Year that we are
      using, the proportionality constant is numerically equal to
      1, i.e., if <i>T</i> is in Year and <i>a</i> in AU, then
      numerically the following equation holds:
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>T</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>a</i><sup>3</sup>, <img src=

          PLAY the motion, and observe how the radius vector sweeps
          through a larger angle in a given time interval when the
          planet is closer to the sun than when it is farther away
          from the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Exercise 2</b>. REWIND the applet, and display the

          sun and a minimum when the planet is farthest from the
          sun?
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Exercise 3</b>. Measure the period <i>T</i> of the
          planet, and then determine the areal speed by dividing
          the area <i>A</i> of the ellipse by <i>T</i>. Since the
          areal speed is constant, one can determine its constant
          value this way. When done, compare your value to that
          shown in the applet's data table.

          <font face="symbol">w</font> and the radius <i>r</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Exercise 4</b>. The areal speed <i>dA</i>/<i>dt</i> can
          depend on only these two <b>dimensional</b> quantities: the
          radius <i>r</i> from the sun to the planet and the angular
          speed <font face="symbol">w</font> with which this radius
          sweeps over the orbital area. Clearly, the larger
          <i>r</i> is the more area will be swept over in a given
          amount of time and the larger <font face= "symbol">w</font>
          is the more area will be swept over in a given amount of
          time. With this in mind, one can imagine a number of ways in
          which <i>dA</i>/<i>dt</i> could depend on <i>r</i> and <font
          face="symbol">w</font>. E.g., <i>dA</i>/<i>dt</i> could be
          equal to

        </ul>
        <p>
          where <i>c</i> is a dimensionless quantity that could still
          vary from point to point along the orbit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make a dimensional analysis to determine which combination
          of powers of <i>r</i> and <font face="symbol">w</font> is
          the only possibility in the expression for
          <i>dA</i>/<i>dt</i>. Note that the dimensions of
          <font face="symbol">w</font> are 1/time because the
          radian measure of an angle can be treated as a
          dimensionless number.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Exercise 5</b>. The combination <i>r</i><sup>2</sup><font
            face= "symbol">w</font> is the only one that has the same
            dimension as <i>dA</i>/<i>dt</i>.  Now investigate whether
            the factor <i>c</i> in front of <i>r</i><sup>2</sup><font
            face= "symbol">w</font> is a constant.
        </p>
		  <p>
				Do this by evaluating the product
            <i>r</i><sup>2</sup><font face= "symbol">w</font> at three
            or more points along the orbit and check if it is
            constant. Values of <i>r</i> and <font
            face="symbol">w</font> are displayed in the applet's data
            box.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you find <i>r</i><sup>2</sup><font face=
          "symbol">w</font> to be a constant, evaluate <i>c</i> by
          using the value of <i>dA</i>/<i>dt</i> from Exercise 3.
          Therefore, what is <i>dA</i>/<i>dt</i> equal to in terms of

        <p>
          <u>Hint</u>. The area <i>A</i> of a circle of radius

          be interacting with the planet. (In reality, other planets
          also exert forces on a given planet, but these forces are a
          lot weaker than the force exerted by the sun.) According to
          Newton's law of universal gravitation, the force exerted by
          the sun on the planet is directed towards the sun and has

        <div class="sectionheading"><li>Kepler's Three Laws for the
        Case of Uniform Circular Motion</div>.
        <br>
          Kepler's three laws can be derived by applying Newton's
          second law to the planet with the gravitational force
          exerted by the sun as the force acting on the planet. The
          mathematics involved in the derivation is easiest if one
          uses calculus. (Newon, in his Principia, did the
          derivation entirely in geometrical terms, even though he
          was one of the inventers of calculus!) A derivation for
          general elliptical orbits will not be given here.

        <p>
          For the case of circular orbits, the derivation of
          Kepler's three laws is not difficult and does not need
          calculus. Let's go through the derivation for circular
          orbits.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Kepler's First Law</u>. What needs to be shown is that
          a planet can revolve around the sun in a circular orbit
          with the sun at the center of the orbit. (The two focal
          points coincide with the center of the circle when the
          eccentricity is zero.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The argument begins with Newton's second law applied to
          the planet, as in Equation (13) above. Suppose a circular
          orbit of radius <i>r</i> is possible and that the planet
          moves in it with constant speed <i>v</i>. Then we know
          from the kinematics of uniform circular motion that the
          acceleration is directed towards the center of the
          circle. Thus, Equation (13) is satisfied as far as the
          directions of the vectors on both sides of the equation
          are concerned if the sun is at the center of the circle
          and the planet's speed is constant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Equation (13) must be satisfied also with respect to the
          magnitudes of both sides of the equation. The magnitude of
          its left-hand side given by Expression (11).  From the
          kinematics of uniform circular motion, we know that the
          magnitude of the acceleration is equal to
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <i>a</i> = <i>v</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>r</i>. <img src=

          (15)
        </p>
        <p>
          Equation (13) can be satisfied if the speed <i>v</i> has the
          right value. This proves that circular planetary motion is
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          For future reference, let's work out what the speed
          <i>v</i> must be to make the magnitudes of the two sides
          of Equation (13) equal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking magnitudes of both sides of Equation (13),
          dividing both sides by <i>m</i>, and using for <i>a</i>
          Expression (15) gives

          We could solve this equation for <i>v</i> if we had to
          and calculate the speed necessary to keep a planet moving
          in a circle of radius <i>r</i> around the sun.

          This is Kepler's third law for circular motion. The
          square of the period is proportional to the cube of the
          radius. The proportionality constant is the same for all
          possible orbits. It is determined by the mass of the sun,
          apart from the universal gravitational constant.

          applies in all cases. Of course, <i>r</i> must then be

          For this equation to be correct, the numerical value of
          <i>GM</i>/(2<font face= "symbol">p</font>)<sup>2</sup> must
          be 1 when using AU and Year as units. Including units,

          <b>Exercise 3</b>. Use either Equation (21) or (22) to work
          out the mass of the sun. Use 1 AU =

    <div class="sectionheading">
      Derivation of Expression for Areal Speed
    </div><br>
     <u>Introductory comments</u>. The expression for the areal
    speed <i>dA</i>/<i>dt</i> of a particle in terms of the radius
    <i>r</i> and the angular speed <font face="symbol">w</font> is
    basically a matter of geometry and has nothing to do with the
    dynamics, i.e., forces, governing the particle's motion.
    Therefore, the expression that is now going to be derived is
    very general and by no means restricted to just planetary
    motion. 
    <p>
      All quantities involved in the expression, radius, angular
      speed, and areal speed, are relative to a reference point. In
      Figure A2 below, this point is point S, the location of the
      sun, but the reference point could be chosen anywhere else as
      well.

    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Derivation</u>. The derivation is based on the geometry
      illustrated in Figure A2. The symbols in Figure A2 are
      explained following the identical earlier Figure A1. It will be
      assumed that you know the definitions of the radian measure of
      an angle, and of angular speed and areal speed as presented in
      the preceding section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The area <font face="symbol">D</font><i>A</i> of the triangle
      SPP' can be approximated by the area of the triangle SPQ. (The
      word "triangle" is used here because the arcs PP' and PQ
      approach straight lines as <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>
      and <font face="symbol">Dq</font> go to zero.) In making this
      approximation, the area of the small triangle PP'Q is neglected.
      In the limit as <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> and <font
      face="symbol">Dq</font> go to zero, the error due to this
      approximation vanishes. Reason: in this limit, the area of
      triangle PP'Q becomes negligible in comparison to that of SPQ.
    </p>
    <p>
      The length <i>b</i> of the base PQ of the triangle SPQ is
      equal to <i>r</i><font face="symbol">Dq</font> if
         <font face="symbol">Dq</font> is in radians. This follows
         from Definition (A1) of the radian measure of angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      As <font face="symbol">Dq</font> goes to zero, the base PQ
      approaches a straight line, and the triangle SPQ with curved
      base PQ approaches an isosceles triangle with a straight
      base. Also, the height of this triangle, extending from the
      midpoint of the base to point S, becomes indistinguishable
      from the side <i>r</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The area of a triangle is equal to
      &frac12;&times;base&times;height. Therefore, in the limit as
      <font face="symbol">Dq</font> goes to zero, we can evaluate
      the area of the triangle SPQ as
      &frac12;&times;<i>r</i><font face=
      "symbol">Dq</font>&times;<i>r</i>. Thus, when approaching
      this limit, we can use

    </p>
    <p>
      Nowhere in this derivation did we use the fact that the
      particle is moving in an ellipse. Therefore, Expression (A6)
      for the areal speed of a particle is valid for any curve and
      any motion along that curve. The point S in general is an
      arbitrary fixed reference point. The value of the areal speed
      at a given instant, as those of <i>r</i> and <font face=
      "symbol">w</font>, will depend on the choice of point S, but
      the form of Relation (A6) will not.
