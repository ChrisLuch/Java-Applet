<p>The applet simulates the motion of a planet around the sun assuming
there are no other planets that exert forces on the given planet.  In
reality, the presence of other planets causes slight perturbations of
the motion simulated by the applet.

<p>In the applet, the sun is assumed to be fixed in an inertial frame
while the planet is revolving around the sun.  This is a very good
approximation since the mass of the sun is much greater than that of
any planet.  (The sun's mass is about 1000 times greater than that of
the largest planet, Jupiter.) </p>

<p>In reality, both the sun and all of its planets are revolving
around their common center of mass, which is at rest in an inertial
frame, the center-of-mass frame.  Since the sun is so much more
massive than its planets, the center of mass of the solar system is
much closer to the sun than to any of the planets so that the small
motion of the sun around the center of mass can be neglected to a very
good approximation.
