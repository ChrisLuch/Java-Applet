      This page is designed to get you started using the applet.
      The applet should be open. The step-by-step instructions on
      this page are to be done in the applet. You may need to
      toggle back and forth between instructions and applet if your
      screen space is limited.

      Drag the box to another location on the screen. Its contents
      are illustrated in Figure 1 below (but most likely with
      values different from those in your case).

    <p>
      Observe that the various quantities are displayed in units
      involving the units "AU" and "Year". These are convenient
      units in an astronomical context.
    </p>
    <p>
      The AU is the <i>astronomical unit</i>. It is a unit of
      distance equal to the semi-major axis of the earth's orbit
      around the sun. 1 AU = 1.496&times;10<sup>11</sup> m.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Year is the time it takes the earth to make one
      revolution around the sun relative to the fixed stars. This
      is also called the the <i>sidereal year</i>. 1 Year = 365.26
      mean solar days. The sidereal year must be distinguished from
      the calendar year which is equal to 365 or 366 mean solar
      days, depending on the particular year. It must also be
      distinguished from the <i>tropical year</i> and the
      <i>anomalistic year</i> which do not concern us in this
      applet.

    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET <img src=
      "../planet1/images/Reset.gif" alt="RESET" align="top"> the
      applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click anywhere in the area of the orbit, and drag the
      sun-planet system to the lower left corner of the applet
      window. Display the data box, and drag it so that it does not
      overlap with the planet's orbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The planet-sun system can be dragged even while the motion is
      in progress. This is useful if the motion would otherwise
      take the planet out of the applet window. PLAY the motion,
      and drag the system while the motion is in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. Moving the entire sun-planet system has no
      effect on the shape of the orbit. What does effect the shape
      of the orbit is the planet's initial position <b>relative</b>
      to the sun and the planet's initial veloocity. The applet
      does not allow you to control either quantity directly.
      Instead, you can control the shape of the orbit by setting
      the orbit's eccentricity <font face="symbol">e</font> and
      semi-major axis <i>a</i>. These quantities are defined in
      connection with Figure 2 below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set the Eccentricity and Semi-major Axis sliders to
      <font face="symbol">e</font> = 0.400 and <i>a</i> = 2.0 AU.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orbit is now elliptical and should look as shown in
      Figure 2 below.
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    <p align="center">
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The longest diameter, the <i>major axis</i>, is indicated by
      a horizontal white line. The applet does not allow you to
      vary the orientation of the major axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance from the center "C" of the ellipse to the edge
      of the ellipse along the major axis is referred to as
      <i>semi-major axis</i>. It is denoted by the symbol <i>a</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance from the center C to one of the two focal points
      of the ellipse (the sun is located at one focal point) is
      denoted by the symbol <i>e</i>. The ratio <i>e</i>/<i>a</i>
      is called the <i>eccentricity</i>. Its symbol is
         <font face="symbol">e</font>. Thus,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <font face="symbol">e</font> = <i>e</i>/<i>a</i>.

      Display the planet's velocity vector <img src=

      relative to the fixed stars by selecting the Vectors button.
      This opens up the vector panel. Select the appropriate
      checkbox. See the illustration in Figure 3 below. The
      velocity vector will be shown in magenta, as in the earlier
      Figure 2.

      <b>Figure 3</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>. The eccentricity and the semi-major axis
      completely determine the shape of the orbit. Display the data
      box. Among the data values you will find
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the distance of the planet from the sun, <i>r</i> = 1.20
        AU,
      </li>
      <li>
        the speed of the planet, <i>v</i> = 6.79 AU/Year.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There is no freedom in choosing these values once the
      eccentricity and the semi-major axis have been set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>. Vary the eccentricity and the semi-major
      axis so that <i>r</i> and <i>v</i> take on the values
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>r</i> = 1.43 AU, <img src="../planet1/images/small.gif"

    </p>
    <p>
      You may find this hard to do because both <i>r</i> and
      <i>v</i> vary simultaneously when you vary either the
      eccentricity or the semi-major axis. You can achieve the
      settings (2) for <font face="symbol">e</font> = 0.350 and
      <i>a</i> = 2.2 AU.
