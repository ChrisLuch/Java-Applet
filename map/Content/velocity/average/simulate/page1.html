        <p><b>Preparation</b>: Velocity/Average/Explain It.

        <p>Average velocity is defined as the ratio of displacement and time
        elapsed.  The applet on Page 2 displays these quantities and
        calculates the corresponding average velocity.

        <p>For details on how to use the applet see Help and ShowMe under
        Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.  A Lesson on average velocity
        and average speed is available there as well.  A useful listing of
        relevant notation and definitions is at the beginning of the Lesson.
