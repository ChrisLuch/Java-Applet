    <p><b>Things to Understand about Average Velocity</b>.

    <p>1.  Average velocity is not the same as average speed.  

    <ul>

    <li>Average velocity is a vector and has direction. Average speed is a
    scalar and does not have direction.</li>

    <li>The <b>magnitude</b> of the average velocity, which <b>is</b> a
    scalar, is <b>not</b> equal to the average speed in general.</li>

    </ul>

    <p><b>Exercise</b> (to illustrate the second bullet). For the average
    velocity obtained in the Exercise on Page 2, calculate the magnitude
    |<img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub>| of the
    average velocity using the components <i>v<sub>x,av</sub></i> and
    <i>v<sub>y,av</sub></i> and the Pythagorean formula,

    <p align="center">
    <img src="AvVelMagn.gif" alt="Equation for Magnitude of Average Velocity">
    </p>

    <p>Compare this magnitude to the average speed, <i>v<sub>av</sub></i>.
    Is it equal to, less than or greater than the average speed?  Can you
    explain the numbers you observe?</p>

    <p>The magnitude of the average velocity is in general different from
    the average speed.  Therefore, we must use different symbols for the
    two quantities.  The notation <i>v<sub>av</sub></i> is used only for
    average speed while the more elaborate notation |<img src="v.gif"
    alt="vector v" align="bottom"><sub>av</sub>| is used for the magnitude
    of the average velocity.</p>
