  <div class="title">Velocity</div>

  <p>The following definition of velocity will be for a mass point.
  See Comment 3 at the end about what it means to talk about the
  "velocity of an extended object".

  <p><b>Definition of velocity in words</b>:

  <blockquote>Velocity is the time-rate-of-change of position.</blockquote>

  <p><b>Definition of velocity in symbols</b>:

  <p align="center">
    <img src="VelDefn.gif" alt="Definition of Velocity">
  </p>

  <p>In this definition, <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom"> denotes the velocity at time <i>t</i> and <img
  src="r.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom"> the position vector of
  the mass point.  The symbol <font face="symbol">D</font><img
  src="r.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom"> denotes the change in
  position (displacement) between the instant at time <i>t</i> and a
  later instant at time <i>t</i> + <font
  face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>,

  <p align="center">
    <font face="symbol">D</font><img src="r.gif" alt="vector r"
  align="bottom"> = <img src="r.gif" alt="vector r"
  align="bottom">(<i>t</i> + <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>) -
  <img src="r.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom">(<i>t</i>).
  </p>

  <p>The symbol <i>d</i><img src="r.gif" alt="vector r"
  align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> is calculus notation for the more explicit
  notation with the limit symbol.  When the notation
  <i>d</i><img src="r.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> is
  used in physics, it is useful to think of <i>d</i><img src="r.gif"
  alt="vector r" align="bottom"> and <i>dt</i> as very small
  quantities and of the symbol <i>d</i><img src="r.gif" alt="vector r"
  align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> as the ratio of these small quantities.

  <p>Velocity is a vector quantity, arising from ratios that have a
  vector in the numerator and a scalar in the denominator.  The
  direction of the velocity vector at a given instant is the direction
  in which the tip of the position vector is moving at that instant,
  which is along the tangent to the mass point's path at that instant.
  See the following illustration which shows the path of a mass point
  in blue, three position vectors (in blue) pointing to three
  different positions of the mass point, and the mass point's velocity
  vectors (in magenta) at these three points.

  </p>

  <p>The magnitude of the velocity is called <i>speed</i>.  Speed is a
  scalar quantity denoted either by <i>v</i> or |<img src="v.gif"
  alt="vector v" align="bottom">|.

  <p>The SI-unit of velocity is m/s.

  <p><u>Comment 1</u>.  The ratio <font face="symbol">D</font><img
  src="r.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom">/<font
  face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> behind the limit operation in the
  definition of velocity is called <i>average velocity</i>.  With this
  concept, the definition of velocity can be reworded as follows.

  <blockquote>The velocity at time <i>t</i> is the limit of the
  average velocity over a time interval extending from time <i>t</i>
  to time <i>t</i> + <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> when <font
  face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> goes to zero.</blockquote>

  <p><u>Comment 2</u>. When a motion is along a straight line, say,
  the <i>x</i>-axis, most of the time one will be working with the
  <i>x</i>-component <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> of the velocity, instead of
  the vector <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> and will
  be referring to <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> as "velocity" instead of
  "<i>x</i>-component of velocity", for brevity's sake.  One may even
  drop the subscript <i>x</i> and write just <i>v</i> instead of
  <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>, again for brevity's sake.  However, one should
  explain that <i>v</i> denotes velocity, not speed, unless this is
  clear from the context.

  <p><u>Comment 3</u>.  When an extended object is moving, its parts
  may be moving with different velocities, e.g., the object may be
  rotating or the object may be vibrating.  In such cases, one cannot
  just speak of "the velocity of the object".

  <p>In many cases, however, it will be possible to assume the object
  to be rigid and non-rotating.  In such cases, all parts of the
  object have the same velocity and it makes sense to speak of
  <b>the</b> velocity of the object.  In other cases, e.g., when the
  object is rotating in addition to performing some motion as a whole,
  one will mean the velocity of the center of mass of the object when
  speaking of the object's velocity.  This should be made clear,
  however, unless it is clear from the context.
