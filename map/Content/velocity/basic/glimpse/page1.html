  <p>The two cars in the picture may be going at the same speed of 80
  km/h, but they don't have the same <b>velocity</b>, because they are
  going in opposite directions.</p>

 <p align="center">velocity = speed + direction</p>

  <p>Speed is a scalar quantity, but velocity is a vector quantity.
  Before studying velocity you need to be somewhat familiar with
  vectors.</p>
