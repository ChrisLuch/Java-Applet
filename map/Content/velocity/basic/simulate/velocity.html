        <div class="title">Activities on Velocity vs. Position</div>

        <p>It is assumed in the following that you start with the applet's
        default settings.  If you have already made some changes in the
        applet, click RESET before you start the following activities.  In
        particular, make sure that the Position Space radio button is selected
        at all times during these activities.

        <p><b>Activities</b>

        <p><ol>

        <li>Select the Position Path button to display the car's path in the
        following motion.  Create a motion of the car by clicking in the
        Velocity Dial and dragging the velocity vector in the dial.

        <p>Click Rewind and select the Velocity button to display the velocity
        vector in magenta.  

        <p>Play the motion, and observe the orientation of the velocity vector
        at different points along the car's path.  To observe this more
        clearly, hide the car's image by deselecting the Car button.  You can
        also Pause the motion and then Step through it to observe the
        orientation of the velocity vector at leisure.

        <p>If the car's motion goes beyond the bounds of the window, you may
        need to drag the car's path back into view.  To do so, simply click
        anywhere in the window and drag.

        <p>Do you observe that at all points along the car's path the velocity
        vector is tangential to the car's path?</li>

        <p><li>Continuing from Activity 1, click Rewind and display the blue
        position vector in addition to the velocity vector.  Again, it is best
        for the following to hide the car's image.  

        <p>Play the motion or Step through it, and observe the motion of the
        tip of the position vector and the direction in which the velocity
        vector points.

        <p>You should find that the velocity vector always points in the
        direction of motion of the tip of the position vector.

        <p>Step through the motion also while the blue position path is hidden.
        Before every step, try to predict the new location of the tip of the
        position vector.  

        <p>Remember that the direction of the velocity vector at a given
        instant is the direction in which the tip of the position vector is
        moving at that instant.  If you take a <b>finite</b> step into time,
        the displacement of the tip of the position vector during that step
        will only approximately coincide with the direction of the velocity
        vector at the beginning of that time step.

        <p>The observations in Activities 1 and 2 can be summarized in the
        following lesson.

        <blockquote>The velocity vector at a given instant points in the
        direction in which the tip of the position vector is moving at that
        instant, which is the direction of the tangent to the mass point's path
        at that instant.</blockquote></li>

        <p><li>Reset the applet, and repeat Activities 1 and 2 for a different
        motion.</li>

        <p><li>Reset the applet, and create a motion with constant velocity by
        clicking in the Velocity Dial at one spot without moving the mouse.

        <p>Click Rewind and Step through the path.  Use the definition of
        velocity to predict the car's motion as follows.

        <p>Before each step, predict the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of
        the car's location at the end of the step from the car's location and
        velocity at the beginning of the step.  The relevant data are
        available in the Data box, which you can display by selecting the Data
        button.  The box can be dragged to a convenient location.  The size of
        the time step is 0.24 s.  </li>

        <p><li>Reset the applet, and repeat the preceding Activity, but this
        time make the car move along a curved path by varying the velocity.
        Again, predict the car's location after each time step.

        <p>Note that when the velocity is not constant and you know the
        velocity only at the beginning of the time step, you can predict the
        car's location at the end of the time step only approximately because
        of the unknown changes in the velocity during the finite time
        step.</li>
