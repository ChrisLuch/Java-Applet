  <p><b>Lesson To Be Learned</b></p>

  <blockquote>

  <p>An object's velocity, the car's in our simulation, is a vector
  whose <b>direction</b> at any given instant is the direction in which the
  object is moving at that instant.</p>

  <p>The <b>magnitude</b> of an object's velociy is a scalar equal to
  the object's speed, indicating how fast the object is moving at a
  given instant.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>Every car has a speedometer to show the magnitude of the car's
  velocity.  It is not so common to find a compass in a car to
  indicate the direction of the car's velocity.  Do you think that
  cars should have a velocity dial like here that combines both the
  functions of a speedometer and a compass?  Of course, such a dial
  could only serve as an <b>indicator</b> of the car's velocity, not
  as a <b>controller</b> of the velocity.</p>
  
  <p>On Page 4, a few other features of the applet will be
  pointed out that may be kind of fun to play with while you are
  thinking about the lesson above.</p>
