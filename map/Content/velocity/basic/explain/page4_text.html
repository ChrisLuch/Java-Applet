  <div class="title">Velocity</div>

  <p>Select the Pos(ition) Path check box to show the car's path (in
  blue), and then move the car with varying speed along some curved
  path.  Stop the motion, and click the REPLAY button.  This will
  reset the car to its start position, but will not erase the car's
  path.  Now unselect the Car check box, and then click the PLAY
  button.  You will see the velocity vector move along the car's
  previous path without the car being visible.  View the motion both
  in velocity space (Velocity Space selected) or position space
  (Velocity Space selected).</p>

  <p><b>Observe</b> that the velocity vector is tangential to the
  path, at all times, and that its magnitude is always proportional to
  the speed with which the vector (actually, the car) is moving along
  the path.</p>

  <p>You can slow down the motion by stepping through it, rather than
  playing it continuously.  To do so, click the STEP button rather
  than the PLAY button.  Stepping through the motion will also make it
  easier to observe that the distance travelled by the car in one step
  (equal time interval) is proportional to the magnitude of the
  velocity vector.</p>
