      <p>The sum of the two vectors, in green, points from the common tail ends of the two vectors to the opposite corner of the parallelogram.</p>

      <p>The sum of two vectors is sometimes referred to as their <i>resultant</i>.

      <p>Suppose the two vectors are forces. 
         Then the resultant (sum) of the two forces is a single force that has the same effect as the two forces acting simultaneously.</p>

      <p>Now, in your notebook, explain the parallelogram method of vector addition.
