<p>The velocity of an object at an instant of time is defined
mathematically as the limit of an average velocity.  The definition is
analogous to that of instantaneous speed.  See
Speed/Instantaneous/Explain It.</p>

<p>First one calculates the average velocity over a time interval
<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> containing the given instant.
Then one shrinks <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> down to zero
size so that it reduces to the given instant.  The limiting value of
the average velocity obtained as <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>
goes to zero is defined as the value of the instantaneous velocity at
the given instant.  Expressed symbolically,</p>

\textbf{A few general points}

\par
\vspace{3 mm} 

Instead of saying 'instantaneous velocity' one says 'velocity' for
short.  Velocity is a vector quantity that is usually denoted by the
symbol $\mathbf{\vec{v}}$.  Its SI-unit is m/s.

\par
\vspace{3 mm}

One abbreviates the limit above by the symbol
$d\mathbf{\vec{r}}/dt$.  Thus,

\par

\[$\mathbf{\vec{v}}$ = \frac{d$\mathbf{\vec{r}}$}{dt} .\]

\par

Mathematically, $d\mathbf{\vec{r}}/dt$ is only a symbol, not
to be interpreted as the ratio of two quantities $d\mathbf{\vec{r}}$
and \textit{dt}.  Physically, however, i.e., experimentally, we have
to think of $d\mathbf{\vec{r}}/dt$ as the ratio of two
(small) quantities.  The reason is that experimentally one cannot
measure displacements and time intervals of vanishing size.
Experimentally, small but finite space and time intervals is all that
can be measured.

\par

These facts are the same as in the definition of instantaneous speed
and will not be discussed further in this session.  The remaining
pages in this session will instead focus on what is different about
velocity, namely, its vector nature.
