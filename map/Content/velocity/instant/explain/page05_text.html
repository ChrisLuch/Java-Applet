\textbf{Thinking About This}

\par
\vspace{3 mm}

$\mathbf{\vec{r}}$ is the symbol for the position vector.
$\mathbf{\vec{r}}(t)$ denotes the position vector at time $t$.  The
expression on the right involving the limit defines what is meant,
mathematically, by the 'time-rate-of-change of the position vector'.

\par
\vspace{3 mm}

$\mathbf{\vec{r}}$(t + \Delta t) - $\mathbf{\vec{r}}$(t) is the
displacement during the time interval from $t$ to $t + \Delta t$.
Thus, the expression behind the limit symbol is just the average
velocity during this time interval, so that the definition of velocity
above, as the one on Page 1, amounts to a limit of an average
velocity.  The only real difference between the definitions of velocity
given here and on Page 1 is that here we talk about a change in the
position vector where on Page 1 we talk about displacement.

\par
\vspace{3 mm}

Note that it does not matter where the origin of the position vector
is chosen for the definition above to be true.  The reason is that the
change in the position vector is determined by the motion of the
vector's tip.  The motion of the tip does not depend on where the
vector's tail end (origin) is fixed.

\par\vspace{3 mm}

You can observe this using the simulation on Page 4 as
follows. Produce a motion and replay it as before.  Then shift the
origin of the position vector by selecting 'Grid', clicking anywhere
in the applet window, and dragging with the control button (Ctrl)
depressed.  You can then unselect 'Grid' if you like.  Now replay the
motion.  The car's path and motion are unchanged.  Only the origin of
the position vector has been moved.  The velocity vector is still in
the direction of motion of the tip of the position vector.

\par\vspace{3 mm}

On the next page, it will be shown, by considering the limit above,
that the magnitude of the velocity is equal to the speed.
