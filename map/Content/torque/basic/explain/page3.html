<div class="title">Torque and Rotation</div>

<p>In general, when one or several forces are acting on a rigid
object, the resulting motion is a combination of

<div class="subtitle">TRANSLATION + ROTATION</div>

<p>where by TRANSLATION is meant the motion of the CM and by ROTATION
a rotation around the CM.  The CM plays a very special role in
describing the general motion of a rigid object.  (If an object is not
rigid, additional vibrational motions of the object are possible that
change the object's shape.  Think of a drop of fluid, for
example.)</p>

<p>Let us study the effect of just a single force, as simulated here.

<p>In the present setup, where the single force applied to the object
 is downward, the CM carries out a parabolic translational motion that
 is just like that of an object in the earth's downward gravitational
 field (so-called projectile motion).  Quite generally, parabolic
 motion of the CM is the result of a constant net force acting on an
 object, and an initial velocity that is not in the direction of the
 net force.</p>

<p>The object shown here oscillates as its CM moves on a parabolic
path.  An object moving in the earth's gravitational field does not
oscillate.  Why not?

<p>Reset the applet and drag the force vector so that it acts at a
 different point, but change neither the magnitude nor the direction
 of the force.  Then PLAY the simulation again.  The CM will move
 along the same parabolic path no matter where the force is acting on
 the object!</p>

<p>However, the oscillatory (rotational) aspect of the motion
<b>does</b> depend on where the force is acting.  Drag the force
vector so that it acts at the CM, and observe the resulting motion.</p>

<p>You should again observe parabolic translational motion, but this
time without any rotation, just as in projectile motion in the earth's
gravitational field.  Why are there no oscillations this time?  Note
that the action of the earth's gravitational force on an object is
such that the force can be thought of as acting at the object's CM.
Still, why does a force that is acting at the CM not produce any
rotation?
