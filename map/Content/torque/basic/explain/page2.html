<div class="title">Torque and Rotation</div>

<p>The simulation is now set up so that a single downward force is
acting at one corner of the rectangular object.  The initial velocity
of the object is upward and to the right.  PLAY the simulation and
observe the motion. You can interrupt the motion by clicking the
PLAY/PAUSE button and then resume the motion by clicking the button
again.
</p>

<p>The object performs two motions at once:

<p>

<ul>
  <li>a <i>translational</i> motion (parabolic) of the center of mass
  (CM)

  </li> <li>a <i>rotational</i> motion, which is oscillatory in this
  case, around the CM.</li>

</ul>
