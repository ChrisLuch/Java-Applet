<div class="title">Torque and Rotation</div>

<p>Each force acting on an object has a torque associated with it.
The sum of all torques is called the <i>net torque</i>.  If the net
torque is non-zero, the state of rotation of the object will change.
The net torque determines the object's angular acceleration, both its
magnitude and sign.  The net torque is directly proportional to the
angular acceleration, just as the net force acting on the object is
directly proportional to the acceleration of the CM.
</p>

<p>PLAY with the simulation and explore the relationship between
forces, and where they are acting, and the resulting rotational
motions.  Observe the value of the net torque.
</p>

<p>Apply forces that are in directions other than vertical and observe
under what conditions the torque is positive or negative and observe
the corresponding angular acceleration of the object.  Does a positive
torque always tend to rotate the object counter-clockwise (positive
angular acceleration)?</p>

<p>You can change the object's shape and the location of the CM by
clicking on the CM and then dragging it with the mouse.  You can move
the entire object to another location by dragging the object at a
point other than the CM.</p>
