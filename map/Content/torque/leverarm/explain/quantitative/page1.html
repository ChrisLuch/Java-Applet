<div class="title">Calculating a Lever Arm</div>

<p><b>Preparation</b>Torque/Lever Arm/Explain It/Qualitative.
</p>

<p><b>Experiment</b> with the simulation until you are sure you know
how to find the lever arm.  You can vary the force (mustard-colored
vector) by dragging its tip, change the point at which the force is
acting (red dot at the tail end of the force vector) by dragging the
vector, and you can drag point O.
</p>

<p>The simulation assumes there is a rotation axis perpendicular to
the screen through O.  The blue line marks the distance <i>r</i> from
the rotation axis to the point at which the force is acting.  This
line is in general <b>not</b> the lever arm.
</p>

<p>To display the lever arm (in green), select LEVER ARM. The lever
arm is the perpendicular distance from the rotation axis onto the line
along which the force is acting (shown as a dotted line).
