<div class="title">The Lever Arm</div>

<p>The beam can rotate about point O.  A 100-kg iron ball is
suspended from the beam.  Where must the upward 200-N force act so
that it will lift the ball?
</p>

<p>This is a matter of adjusting the lever arm, shown in green.  To
adjust the lever arm, drag point B at which the force is acting either
right or left.  
</p>

<p>Upon clicking RELEASE, the system will be released and you can see
if the 200-N force has sufficient torque to lift the ball.  To try
another position, click RESET.
