<div class="title">The Lever Arm</div>

<p><u>Final Suggestions</u>
</p>

<p>1.  To practise finding the lever arm, go to Torque/Lever
Arm/Simulate It.
</p>

<p>2.  Do you want to know how to calculate the lever arm and the
torque?  Go to Torque/About an Axis/Explain It/Quantitative.
</p>

<p>3.  Use the simulation on the left to check your understanding
of the lever arm.  To do so, change the following by dragging:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>position of rotation axis</li>
  <li>force vector (drag its tip)</li>
  <li>point at which force is applied.</li>
</ul>

<p>The corresponding lever arm will always be shown in green.
</p>

<p>4.  In your notebook, write down your own explanation of what
a lever arm is and how you can construct it.
