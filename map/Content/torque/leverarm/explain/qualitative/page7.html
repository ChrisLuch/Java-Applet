<div class="title">The Lever Arm</div>

<p>A <b>non-zero</b> force will have <b>zero</b> torque about an axis
if its lever arm is zero.  You can use the simulation on the left to
find siutations in which the lever arm is zero.
</p>

<p>Click either the up or down arrows next to ROTATE FORCE or ROTATE
POINT.
</p>

<p>ROTATE FORCE will cause the force vector to change in direction.
ROTATE POINT will cause the point at which the force is acting to move
in a circle around the rotation axis.
</p>

<p>There are many arrrangements in which the lever arm is zero.  Try
to find some of them.
