<h4><center>Calculating a Torque</center></h4>

<p><b>Scalar Component Method</b>



<p>Imagine a pair of x,y coordinate axes drawn with point O as their
origin.  If you click SHOW AXES, these axes will be displayed.


<p>Suppose you know the components of the displacement vector <b>r</b>,
pointing from the origin O to the point A at which the force is
acting, and the components of the force <b>F</b> relative to these axes,

<p><b>r</b> = (x,y), <b>F</b> = (F<sub>x</sub>,F<sub>y</sub>).


<p>Then you calculate the torque relative to O by using the equation

<p align="center"><font face="symbol">t</font> = <i>xF<sub>y</sub></i>
- <i>yF<sub>x</sub></i> .

<p>Calculate the torque from the given values using this equation.
Click CHECK VALUE to compare answers.

<p>Repeat the exercise for a different force and reference point.
