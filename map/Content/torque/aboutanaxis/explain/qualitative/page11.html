<p><b>Net torque and net force</b></p>

<p>If several forces act on the object, each one contributes a torque
relative to point O.  The sum of these torques is the <i>net
torque</i>.  If the net torque is zero, the object will not start
rotating.
</p>

<p>Torques and forces are related, but they are different quantities.
It is possible to have two forces acting on an object so that the net
force is non-zero while the net torque is zero.  Vice versa, it is
possible to have two forces acting on the object such that the net
force is zero while the corresponding net torque is non-zero.  The
latter arrangement is called a force <i>couple</i>.  <b>Try</b> to
create some force couples.
</p>

<p>Now, in your Notebook, explain the difference between forces and
torques, when a torque is positive, zero, or negative, and what
determines the magnitude of a torque.
