<div class="title">Torque About an Axis</div>

<p><b>What variables does a torque depend on?</b></p>

<p>The torque due to a force depends on 
</p>

<ol>

<li>the magnitude of the force</li>

<li>the direction of the force</li>

<li>the reference point</li>

<li>the point at which the force is acting.</li>

</ol>

<p>It has been stated earlier that the torque depends on the magnitude
of the force and the lever arm.  Items 2 to 4 together determine the
lever arm.  Let's investigate them separately.  You have already
experimented with Item 3 on Page 4.  Here, let us investigate items 2
and 4.</p>

<p>Draw a single force vector and, keeping the reference point
 <b>fixed</b>, change either the direction of the force (by dragging
 its tip) or the point at which the force is acting (by dragging the
 entire vector at its midpoint).
</p>

<p>Observe the resulting motions. You should be able to achieve
 positive, zero, or negative torques by making either of these
 changes.  <b>Try it</b>.
