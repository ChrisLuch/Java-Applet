<div class="title">Torque About an Axis</div>

<p>We'll start exploring what torques are on the next page.  Here,
let's have a look at the simulation.
</p>

<p>The square object can rotate about an axis through O that is
perpendicular to the screen.  The mustard-colored arrow represents a
force acting on the object.  The force acts on the object at the point
at the tail end of the force arrow.
</p>

<p><b>Click</b> the PLAY button to start the rotation.  The motion
  will stop when the configuration is such that the net torque acting
  on the square object is zero.  You can interrupt the motion by
  clicking the PAUSE button.
</p>

<p>To change any settings, e.g., a force or the point at which the
force is acting, click the RESET button first.  To change a force,
drag the tip of the force vector.  To change the point at which the
force is acting, drag the entire vector near its midpoint.

</p>

<p>You can have up to three forces act on the square object.  To add a
force, click one of the three buttons A to C and then click inside the
square and draw the force with the mouse.
</p>

<p>You can erase a force vector by selecting the eraser and then
clicking on the vector.  If you select the Lever Arm button, the lever
arms for all forces will be displayed.

<p>The motion simulated here is not realistic.  It is only intended to
show the <b>sense</b> of rotation (clockwise or counter-clockwise)
caused by the torque(s) acting on the object.  For details on the
reality of the motion, see Page 6.
