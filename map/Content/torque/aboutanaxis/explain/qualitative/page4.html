<div class="title">Torque About an Axis</div>

<p><b>Magnitude of torque</b>. The torque created by a force is larger
if the force is larger.  However, the torque is determined not only by
the force itself, but also by the lever arm.  Given the force and
where it is acting, the lever arm, and with it the torque, depends on
the location of point O.
</p>

<p><b>Try the following</b>.  Make a single force act on the square
and drag point O to a new location, which can even be outside the
square.  Notice how the torque changes as you move point O.  Then
click the PLAY button.
</p>

<p>Observe both the rate of rotation and the sense of rotation,
clockwise or counter-clockwise, for different choices of O.  The
simulation is designed so that the rate of rotation is proportional to
the torque, although it is not realistic in other respects.

</p>

<p><b>Important lesson: The torque depends on the location of point
O<b>.
