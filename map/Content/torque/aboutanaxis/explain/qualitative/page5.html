<p><b>Rotation Axis or Reference Point?</b>
</p>

<p>We have been talking about both the reference point O and the
rotation axis through O, and the vector torque has been hinted at as
well.  This page will try to explain the connections between these
concepts a bit more and will explain some general aspects of motions
involving rotation.</p>

<p>For the material in Vector Torque under Get Information you need to
understand the concept of the vector product.</p>

<ul>

<li>To deal with rotations in three dimensions, one defines a quantity
called <i>vector torque</i>.  It is defined relative to a reference
<b>point</b> O, not relative to an axis.  The reference point can be
chosen arbitrarily, and the vector torque depends on the choice of
this point.
</li>

<li>Imagine three orthogonal axes through the reference point O.  The
vector torque will have three scalar components relative to these
axes.  If an object is rotating about an axis parallel to one of these
axes, only the torques about this axis are needed to deal with the
motion.</li>

<li>Any motion of a rigid body can always be thought of as a
combination of a rotation of the body about some axis (in general
rotations, this axis will change orientation from one moment to the
next) and a translation of the body.  (A translation is a motion in
which all parts of the body undergo the same displacement.)</li>

<li>If the velocity vectors of all parts of a rigid body lie in one
plane, then the rotation axis is perpendicular to the plane and the
translation is in the plane.  The rotation can be thought of as a
rotation about ANY axis perpendicular to the plane.  If one imagines
the rotation to be around a different (parallel) axis, only the
overall displacement (translation) of the object will be affected, but
the amount of rotation is independent of which axis is taken as the
rotation axis.</li>

<li>To deal with the dynamics of a rotational motion of the kind
described in the preceding bullet, one needs to use the net torque
about an axis as described in that bullet.  Any such axis will
do.  The axis can even be outside the given object, as in our
simulation.  Point O is the point where the axis intersects the
screen.</li>

<li>Although the torque about an axis takes on a different value when
the original axis is replaced by another axis parallel to it, and the
numbers in the subsequent calculations change as well, the value of
anything that can be observed will be unaffected by these changes.
This is as it ought to be.  Clearly, observable quantities cannot be
affected by arbitrary choices of reference axes, coordinate axes,
etc.</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that the motion in our simulation is such that the imagined
reference axis through O is treated as a FIXED axis, i.e., the point O
is not being translated.  If the rotation axis through O were not
fixed, the torques about this axis would still have the values shown
here, but the resulting motions of the square object would be
different.
