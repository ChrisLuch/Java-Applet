<div class="title">Torque About an Axis</div>

<p>On Pages 1 and 5, it was stated that the torque is really defined to be a
vector, but that there are situations in which one needs only one
component of this vector.  Let us review what these situations are.
</p>

<p>They are as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>rotational motions like those simulated here, around a fixed axis,
and </li>

<li>somewhat more general motions in which an object is rotating
about an axis of fixed direction in which the axis is undergoing
translational motion.  A round object rolling down an incline is an
example of the latter kind of motion.</li>

</ul>

<p>In situations like these, the forces very often will lie in the
plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, as in our simulation.  The
corresponding torques can then be calculated as explained on Page 9.
For more detail on how to calculate the torques in these situations
see Torque/About An Axis/Explain It/Quantitative.</p>

<p>For information about more general situations in which the torque
<b>vector</b> is required, go to Torque/Torque Vector/Explain It.
