<p><b>The physical significance of the reference point</b>.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>. If torques (about an axis) are defined so that
they depend on the location of point O (the axis is always assumed to
be perpendicular to the screen), does that mean there are observable
physical phenomena that depend on the choice of this point?
</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  Not at all!.  Whatever is observed in the
laboratory cannot possibly depend on an arbitrary choice of a
reference point.  Calculations with torques will always yield the same
observable results no matter how one chooses the reference point.
</p>

<p>Torques do depend on the reference point.  However, one does not
observe torques in the laboratory.  What one observes are rotations,
angular accelerations, etc.  The value of an angular acceleration of a
rotating object does <b>not</b> depend on the choice of the reference
point.
