  <p>The diagram shows a ball that has been moved from the initial
  position <img src="r.gif" align="bottom"><sub>i</sub> =
  (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>i</sub> = (10.0,-15.0) m to the final
  position <img src="r.gif" align="bottom"><sub>f</sub> =
  (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>f</sub> = (-20.0,-10.1) m along the curved
  path shown in blue. The <i>displacement</i> of the ball is a
  <b>vector</b> pointing from the initial to the final position.  It
  is represented in the diagram by a green arrow.

  <p>The symbol for displacement is <img src="d.gif"
  align="bottom">. The displacement of an object is a measure of how
  much the position of the object has changed, and, as the diagram
  illustrates, it is equal to the change in the object's position
  vector,

  <p align="center"><img src="d.gif" align="bottom"> = <img
  src="r.gif" align="bottom"><sub>f</sub> - <img src="r.gif"
  align="bottom"><sub>i</sub>.</p>

  <p>The magnitude (absolute value) <i>d</i> of the displacement is
  equal to the straight-line distance from the initial to the final
  position (represented by the length of the green arrow in the
  diagram above).  If you write the letter <i>d</i> without an arrow
  above it, it denotes this magnitude, not the displacement
  <b>vector</b>.  If you mean the vector, don't forget to include the
  arrow above the letter.

  <p>In the case illustrated above, the magnitude <i>d</i> of the
  displacement has the value

  <p align="center"><i>d</i> = 30.4 m .</p>

  <p>This straight-line distance between the initial and final
  position of the ball must be distinguished from the <i>distance
  traveled</i> by the ball, which is measured along the actual path
  taken by the ball, the blue curve in the diagram.  Here, the
  distance <i>s</i> traveled is equal to

  <p align="center"><i>s</i> = 33.6 m .</p>

  <p>The distance traveled is greater than the magnitude of the
  displacement whenever the path traveled is not straight and
  uni-directional.
