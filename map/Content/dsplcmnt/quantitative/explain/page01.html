  <div class="title">Displacement vs. Distance Traveled</div>

<p><b>Preparation</b>: Displacement/Position Change/Explain It.</p>

<p>The applet on Page 2 lets you place a ball at an initial position
of your choice and drag it to a new position. The applet shows the
displacement of the ball and the path taken by the ball along which
the distance traveled is measured.

<p>Details on how to use the applet are available under Applet Help
from the applet's Help menu.

<p>Suggested Activities to be performed with the applet are available
in the Related Items panel in the lower left-hand corner.

<p>Calculations related to Item 5 of the Activities are provided on
Pages 3 to 5.  Also see the Lesson available from the Help menu under
Applet Help.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b>. Displacements are <b>vectors</b>.  In fact, they
are the prototype for <b>all</b> vectors.  What one can do with
displacement vectors, one can do with all vectors.  It is helpful when
working with vectors in general to imagine them as displacements.
This makes things more concrete.

<p>About the general properties of vectors, and displacement vectors
in particular, go to Mathematics/Vectors.

<p>In contrast to displacement, distance and distance traveled are
<b>scalar</b> quantities.
