<h3> <Center>Answers to the July 19, 1996 Questions</Center></h3>

<p><b>Question (a)</b>.  Diagram (e) below shows three pairs of
vectors a* and b*.  For each case, find the sum of these two vectors.
In the case of pair (iii), both vectors have their tail ends at the
dot.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The following three diagrams, (f.i), (f.ii), and
(f.iii), show the the sum a* + b* and how it is constructed, in each of
the three cases.  The two vectors are joined so that the head of the
first vector, a*, is attached to the tail of the second vector, b*.
The resultant, i.e., a* + b*, always points from the free (unattached)
tail to the free (unattached) head.  The resultant is shown in
red.</p>

<p>Note that in diagram (f.iii) the vectors are drawn side-by-side,
rather than superimposed on each other.  This way, one can see each
vector more clearly.  Remember that if the arrow representing a vector
is shifted the vector represented by the arrow does not change as long
as the length and direction of the arrow remain the same in the
process.</p>

<p><b>Question (b)</b>.  Show that vector addition is commutative,
i.e., that a* + b* = b* + a*, for any two vectors a* and b*.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  Diagrams (g.i) and (g.ii) show that the same vector
results when the head of a* is joined to the tail of b* as when the
head of b* is joined to the tail of a*.  Thus, a* + b* = b* + a*.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>. Diagram (g.iii) shows that the resultant a* + b* is
one of the two diagonals in a parallelogram whose sides consist of the
two vectors a* and b*, namely, the diagonal that originates at the
point where a* and b* are joined tail-to-tail.  Thus we have a second
method for finding the sum of two vectors: join the two vectors
tail-to-tail, complete the parallelogram of which the two vectors form
two sides, and then draw the diagonal from the point where the two
vectors are joined tail-to-tail to the opposite corner of the
parallelogram.  This is called the parallelogram method of finding the
sum of two vectors.</p>
 
<a name="A8c">
<p><b>Question (c)</b>.  Show that vector addition obeys the
associative law, i.e., that (a* + b*) + c* = a* + (b* + c*).</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  Diagrams (h.i) and (h.ii) below illustrate the
additions on the left-hand and right-hand sides, respectively, of the
equation above.  You can see that the green vector, which is the
overall resultant, is the same in both cases.</p>

<p>The reason why this is so is apparent from diagram (h.iii).  When
working out (a* + b*) + c* or a* + (b* + c*), one is effectively
joining the three arrows in the manner illustrated in diagram (h.iii),
i.e., head of a* to tail of b* and head of b* to tail of c*.  This
produces a unique resultant from the tail of a* to the head of c*.</p>

<a name="A8d">
<p><b>Question (d)</b>.  There exists a vector called the 'null
vector' and denoted 0 (without an arrow above the symbol 0; this null
vector is not, however, the same as the number 0; this notation is,
therefore, not ideal).  When the null vector is added to any given
vector a* the result is again that vector, i.e., a* + 0 = a*.  Find
the arrow that would represent the null vector.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  An arrow of zero length, i.e., a point, when added to any other arrow will not change that arrow.  This is therefore the null vector.  The null vector cannot be drawn on a diagram because a point is of zero size.</p>
  
<a name="A8e">
<p><b>Question (e)</b>.  For any given vector a*, there exists another
vector denoted -a* such that a + (-a*) = 0.  (Here, 0 denotes the null
vector because the sum of two vectors is again a vector.)  Draw a
vector a* and find the corresponding vector -a*.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  Diagram (i) below shows that when an arrow that has
the same length as a* but opposite direction is added to a* the result
will be the null vector because the tail of a* and the head of the
reversed a* are at the same point (if a* and the reversed a* are drawn
on top of each other, not side-by-side as in the diagram).  Thus, -a*
is obtained by reversing a*.<p>
