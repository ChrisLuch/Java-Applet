<p>Physics 205, Physics 215, Astronomy 211 - A swimming pool can be
filled with two water pipes.  Pipe A alone is able to fill the pool in
one hour.  Pipe B alone is able to fill the pool in two hours.  Pipes
A and B together are able to fill the pool in </p>

<p>(a) 1.5 h</p>

<p>(b) 30 min</p>

<p>(c) 20 min</p>

<p>(d) 40 min</p>

<h4>August 23, 1996</h4>

<p>Physics 205, Physics 215, Astronomy 211 - Assume the moon is a
perfect sphere.  Somebody puts a rope tightly around the equator of
the moon so that no space is left between the rope and the moon's
surface.  Then he cuts the rope, inserts 1 m of rope between the two
ends of the cut rope, and redistributes the rope around the equator so
that it has an equal distance everywhere from the surface of the
moon.  <b>(Circle properties.  Algebra.)</b></p>

<p>The distance between the rope and the moon now is</p>

<p>(a) enough for a cat to squeeze through under the rope</p>
<p>(b) just barely enough for a mouse to squeeze through under the rope</p>  
<p>(c) not nearly enough for a mouse to squeeze through</p>
<p>(d) impossible to say without knowing the moon's diameter.</p>

<h4>August 16, 1996</h4>

<p>Physics 205, Physics 215, Astronomy 211 - For this question you need
to use the definition of average speed.  The definition is as
follows.</p>

<center><img src = "images/A11G1.gif"></center>

<p>Suppose somebody drives from city A to city C via city B without
stopping.  The distance d from city A to city B is equal to the
distance from city B to city C.  Suppose also that the driver
maintains an average speed of 80 km/h between cities A and B, but
wants her average speed for the entire trip from city A to city C to
be 100 km/h.  What must be her average trip during the second part of
the journey, from city B to city C?<b> (Algebra)</b>.</p>

<p>This problem is not as easy as it may look.  The answer is
<b>not</b> 120 km/h.  Do the problem in two ways.</p>

<p><b>(a)</b> Assume that d = 40 km.  Work out the time for the trip
from A to B.  Then work out the total travel time, given the overall
average speed and total distance from A to C.  From these two times
you can find the travel time for the part of the trip from B to C.
Now you can calculate the average speed for this part of the trip.</p>

<a href="http://www.phas.ucalgary.ca/~hlaue/bkgda/a12.html">Answer</a>.

<p><b>(b)</b> Now do the entire calculation in symbols, assuming no
special value for the distance d.  Show that the answer is independent
of d.</p>

<h4>August 9, 1996</h4>

<p>Physics 215 - For this week's question, you need to have a bit of
background on vectors.  You may not have studied vectors before.  In
that case, look up <a
href="http://www.phas.ucalgary.ca/~hlaue/vectors.html"> vectors</a>
for a brief introductory lesson that will provide the necessary
background including an explanation of the notation used here.  You
should also review the July 19 and August 2 questions.</p>

<p><b>(a)</b>. The following diagram (i) shows a vector a* and two
stippled axes.  Find a vector b* along axis 1 such that c* = a* + b*
is along axis 2.  <b>(Vectors)</b>.</p>

<a href="http://www.phas.ucalgary.ca/~hlaue/bkgda/a11.html">Answer</a>.

<p><b>(b)</b>.  The following diagram (ii) shows the same vector a* as
in diagram (i) and two stippled axes, one of which is different from
that in diagram (i).  Again, find a vector b* along axis 1 such that
c* = a* + b* is along axis 2.  <b>(Vectors)</b>.</p>

<a href="http://www.phas.ucalgary.ca/~hlaue/bkgda/a11.html#A11b">Answer</a>.

<p><b>(c)</b>.  Suppose the angle between vector a* and axis 1 is
equal to 20 degrees.  Suppose also that the length of an arrow
represents the magnitude of the corresponding vector.  Take the
magnitude a of vector a* to be equal to 10.  Calculate the magnitudes
of vectors b* and c* = a* + b* in cases (i) and (ii).  Write your
answers in the form of equations using the appropriate symbols.<b>
(Trigonometry)</b>.</p>
