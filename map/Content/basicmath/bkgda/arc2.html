<h4>August 2, 1996</h4>

<p>For this week's question, you need to have a bit of background on
vectors.  You may not have studied vectors before.  In that case, look
up <a href="http://www.phas.ucalgary.ca/~hlaue/vectors.html">
vectors</a> for a brief introductory lesson that will provide the
necessary background including an explanation of the notation used
here.  You should also review the July 19 question.</p>

<p>Parts (i), (ii), and (iii) of the following diagram each show the
same vector a* and two axes, labelled 1 and 2.  The two axes are
different in each case.  In each case, construct two vectors, a1* and
a2*, such that a1* is oriented along axis 1 and a2* along axis 2 and
such that a1* + a2* = a*.<b>  (Vectors)</b>.</p>

<p><b>(a)</b> The difference between two vectors a* and b* is defined
as a* - b* = a* + (-b*).  For each of the three pairs of vectors shown
in diagram (e) of the July 19 question, parts (i) to (iii), determine
the difference a* - b*.  The diagram is reproduced below.</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> In the answer to part (b) of the July 19 question, it
was pointed out that one can add two vectors by joining them tail to
tail, constructing a parallelogram with the two vectors as sides, and
then drawing one of the two diagonals in the parallelogram.  Show that
the difference a* - b* is represented by the other diagonal and
determine the direction one should assign to this diagonal.</p>

<h4>July 19, 1996</h4>

<p>The following questions are related to the addition of vectors.
You may not have studied vectors before.  In that case, look up <a
href="vectors.html"> vectors</a> for a brief introductory lesson that
will provide the necessary background.</p>
  
<p><b>Question (a)</b>.  Diagram (e) below shows three pairs of
vectors a* and b*.  For each case, find the sum of these two vectors.
In the case of pair (iii), both vectors have their tail ends at the
dot.</p>

<a href="http://www.phas.ucalgary.ca/~hlaue/bkgda/a8.html">Answer</a>.

<p>The following questions involve small proofs.  All proofs should be
based on the graphical construction of a vector sum explained
above.</p>

<p><b>Question (b)</b>.  Show that vector addition is
commutative, i.e., that a* + b* = b* + a*, for any two vectors a* and
b*.</p>

<a href="http://www.phas.ucalgary.ca/~hlaue/bkgda/a8.html#A8b">Answer</a>.

<p><b>Question (c)</b>.  Show that vector addition obeys the
associative law, i.e., that (a* + b*) + c* = a* + (b* + c*).</p>

<a href="http://www.phas.ucalgary.ca/~hlaue/bkgda/a8.html#A8c">Answer</a>.

<p><b>Question (d)</b>.  There exists a vector called the 'null
vector' and denoted 0 (without an arrow above the symbol 0; this null
vector is not, however, the same as the number 0; this notation is,
therefore, not ideal).  When the null vector is added to any given
vector a* the result is again that vector, i.e., a* + 0 = a*.  Find
the arrow that would represent the null vector.</p>

<a href="http://www.phas.ucalgary.ca/~hlaue/bkgda/a8.html#A8d">Answer</a>.

<p><b>Question (e)</b>.  For any given vector a*, there exists another
vector denoted -a* such that a + (-a*) = 0.  (Here, 0 denotes the null
vector because the sum of two vectors is again a vector.)  Draw a
vector a* and find the corresponding vector -a*.</p>

<h4>July 12, 1996</h4>

<p>When learning a new subject, it is excellent practice to vary a
question on the subject to which one already knows the answer.  </p>

<p>Last week's question was a variation of the June 28 question that
involved a change in the orientation of the parabolic mirror, but not
an essential change in the physical situation.  This week's question
will be another variation of the June 28 question, but this time it
will be a variation in the physical situation. </p>

<p>Physics 215 - Suppose the parabolic mirror is oriented as in the
June 28 question as in the diagram below.  This time, however, the
rays are incident from the right.  One such ray is shown.  Now the
mirror acts like a convex mirror (mirror bulging towards the incoming
rays) while in the June 28 and July 5 questions it acted like a concave
mirror (it looks like a 'cave' to the incoming rays.)</p>

<center><img src="images/A7G1.gif"></center>

<p>Prove that all rays incident on the mirror parallel to the optical
axis are reflected so that they seem to be coming from one and the
same point on the optical axis, which is again called the focal point.
Find the distance between this focal point and the vertex of the
mirror.  (<b>Geometry.</b>) </p>

<p><b>Hint</b>.  It is not necessary to repeat the calculations that
were done in the June 28 question.  Given the  result
obtained in that case, one can obtain the answer to the present case
by comparing the geometry of the present configuration to that of the
June 28 case.</p>

<h4>July 5, 1996</h4>

<p>When learning a new subject, it is excellent practice to vary a
question on the subject to which one already knows the answer.  </p>

<p>Try this technique by varying the last question, the June 28
question.  One variation is suggested below.  In addition, try to make
a variation of your own and then work out the answer.  </p>

<p><b>Question</b>. Physics 215 - Suppose a parabolic mirror is
oriented as in the diagram below, i.e., turned 90 degrees relative to
the orientation of the mirror in the June 28 question.  You might ask
yourself what equation would now describe the shape of the mirror.
The answer is given in the diagram.  Given this mirror, prove again
that all rays incident on the mirror parallel to the optical axis are
reflected so that they go through one and the same point on the
optical axis, the focal point, which is a distance 1/(4c) away from
the vertex of the mirror.  (<b>Analytical Geometry. Algebra.</b>) </p>
