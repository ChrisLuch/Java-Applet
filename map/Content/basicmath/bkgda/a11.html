<h3> <Center>Answer to the August 9, 1996 Question</Center></h3>

<p>For this week's question, you need to have a bit of background on
vectors.  You may not have studied vectors before.  In that case, look
up <a href="vectors.html"> vectors</a> for a brief introductory lesson
that will provide the necessary background including an explanation of
the notation used here.  You should also review the July 19 and August 2
questions.</p>

<p><b>(a)</b>. The following diagram (i) shows a vector a* and two
stippled axes.  Find a vector b* along axis 1 such that c* = a* + b*
is along axis 2.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  We will decompose all vectors involved into their
component vectors.  The components will be taken along axes 1 and 2.
This allows us to reduce the problem to finding the component vectors
of b*.  This is a simpler problem.</p>

<p>The component method is contained in the set of equations
below.</p>

<center><img src = "images/A10G4.gif"></center>  

<p>Equation (1) is the equation relating the three vectors we are
dealing with in this problem: a*, b*, and c*.  If we write a* as a sum
of its components a1* and a2* and do the same for b* and c* and
substitute all of this into equation (1), we obtain equation (2).
Equation (2) can be satisfied by satisfying equations (3) and (4).
(In fact, this is the only way to satisfy equation (2).)  Equations
(3) and (4) deal with either the 1-components or the 2-components
alone and are therefore easy to deal with.</p>

<p>Let us now find b1* so that equation (3) is satisfied.  Since we
are told that c* is along axis 2, we know that c1* = 0.  Thus,
equation (3) reduces to a1* + b1* = 0.  The following diagram shows
a1* (obtained by drawing a line through the tip of a* parallel to axis
2; parallel projection of a* onto axis 1).  The diagram also
shows the vector b1* that added to a1* gives 0.  It is a vector of
equal magnitude and opposite direction to a1*.</p>

<p>We don't need equation (4) at all for this part of the problem.
Since we are told that b* is along axis 1, we know that b2* = 0.
Thus, b* = b1* + b2* = b1* = -a1*.</p>

<p><b>(b)</b>.  The following diagram (ii) shows the same vector a* as
in diagram (i) and two stippled axes, one of which is different from
that in diagram (i).  Again, find a vector b* along axis 1 such that
c* = a* + b* is along axis 2.</p>

<center><img src = "images/A10G2.gif"></center>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The solution of this part of the question is along
exactly the same lines as that to part (a).  The only difference is
that the 1-component of a* is different because axis 2 is different in
parts (a) and (b).  Projecting parallel to axis 2 to find the
1-component of a* therefore gives different results.  Compare the
following diagram to that at the end of part (a).</p>

<a name="A11c">

<p><b>(c)</b>.  Suppose the angle between vector a* and axis 1 is
equal to 20 degrees.  Suppose also that the length of an arrow
represents the magnitude of the corresponding vector.  Take the
magnitude a of vector a* to be equal to 10.  Calculate the magnitudes
of vectors b* and c* = a* + b* in cases (i) and (ii).  Write your
answers in the form of equations using the appropriate symbols.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  In order to determine the vector c*, we need
equation (4) above.  Since c* is known to be along axis 2, its
1-component is equal to zero.  Thus we need to determine only its
2-component, by using equation (4).  Since the 2-component of b* is
zero, we have c* = a2*.  The following two diagrams illustrate how to
construct a2* in cases (i) and (ii).</p>

<p>The following two diagrams summarize the previous results for cases
(i) and (ii) and also show which angles are equal to 20 degrees.
Remember that b = |a1*|.  (The notation for the magnitude of vector b
is b* and for the magnitude of a1* is |a1*|.)  Using a = 10 and the
trigonometry of right-angle triangles, reviewed in the June 7, 1996
Question, we obtain the results for b and c that are indicated in the
boxed equations in the diagrams below.</p>
