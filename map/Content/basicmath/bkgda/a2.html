</center>

<p><b>Question</b>.

<p>Each of the four triangles above contains a right angle.  The three
sides are labelled a, b, and c in no particular order.  One of the two
angles that is not a right angle is labeled by the Greek letter alpha.
</p>

<p>The three most commonly used trigonometric functions are the sine,
the cosine, and the tangent.  These are the trig functions that you
will find on all scientific pocket calculators.</p>

<p>For each of the four triangles (i) to (iv), express one of the
three sides in terms of one of the other sides and an appropriate trig
function evaluated for alpha.  E.g., in the first row of the table
below, you are asked to write down expressions for side a in terms of
side b and angle alpha.  Fill in all slots in the table.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.</p>

<p>The table when completed should look as follows.  </p>

<p><b>Explanation</b>.  </p>

 
<p>The sine, cosine, and tangent functions are equal to certain
ratios of the sides in a right-angle triangle.  These ratios are
listed in the diagram below.  </p>

<p>The hypothenuse is the side opposite to the right angle.  The
'adjacent' to angle<font face ="symbol"> a </font>is that side of the
triangle that forms one of the two sides of the angle.  (The
hypothenuse forms the other side of the angle.)  The 'opposite' to
angle <font face ="symbol"> a</font> is the side of the triangle
opposite to the angle.  In using trigonometric functions in a
right-angle triangle, your first step should be to find the right
angle and the hypothenuse, and then the adjacent and the opposite to a
given angle in the triangle.  If you are systematic in doing that, not
too much else can go wrong, assuming you know the three equations for
the sine, cosine, and tangent listed above.  These equations must
simply be memorized.  </p>

<p>Three of the entries in the table will now be derived, one
involving the sine, one the cosine, and one the tangent function.
These are the entries in the first row of the table in columns (i),
(ii), and (iv).  The other entries are derived in analogous fashion.

triangle (i):</b> </p>

<p>c is the hypothenuse.  a is the adjacent and b is the opposite to
angle <font face ="symbol"> a</font>.  Thus, </p>
