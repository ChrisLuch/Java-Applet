<h3> <Center>Answer to the August 2, 1996 Question</Center></h3>

<p>For this week's question, you need to have a bit of background on
vectors.  You may not have studied vectors before.  In that case, look
up <a href="vectors.html"> vectors</a> for a brief introductory lesson
that will provide the necessary background including an explanation of
the notation.  You should also review the July 19 question.</p>

<p>Parts (i), (ii), and (iii) of the following diagram each show the
same vector a* and two axes, labelled 1 and 2.  The two axes are
different in each case.  In each case, construct two vectors, a1* and
a2*, such that a1* is oriented along axis 1 and a2* along axis 2 and
such that a1* + a2* = a*.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The vectors that lie along the two axes and whose
sum is equal to the given vector are called 'component vectors'.  As
the following construction will make clear, a given vector has two
uniquely determined component vectors.  The number 'two' applies if we
are dealing with vectors in a two-dimensional space, as in the present
case.  In a three-dimensionals space, any given vector will have three
uniquely determined component vectors, once three axes are specified.
The component vectors of a given vector depend on how the axes are
chosen.</p>

<p>The method that allows us to find the component vectors is the
method of 'parallel projection onto the axes'.  This method will now be
explained for part (i).</p>

<p>The next figure, with diagrams (i.1), (i.2), and (i.3), explains
how to find the component vectors in case (i).  To find the component
vector for axis 1, one has to parallel-project vector a* onto axis 1.
To do this pretend you are shining a beam of parallel light rays that
are all parallel to axis 2 onto vector a*.  (The ray through the tip
of vector a* is indicated by a stippled line).  Then vector a* will
throw a shadow onto axis 1.  This shadow is the component vector along
axis 1.  We will denote it a*1.  See the following diagram (i.1).
What this projection parallel to axis 2 accomplishes is to subtract
the component vector along axis 2.  We are left with the component
vector along axis 1.</p>

<p>Diagram (i.2) above shows the analogous parallel projection along
axis 1.  It subtracts the component along axis 1 and leaves us with
the component vector along axis 2, denoted a*2.  Diagram (i.3) above
shows vector a* and its two component vectors a*1 and a*2.  You can
see that the sum of the two component vectors is equal to a*.  Given
these two axes, there are no other two vectors that lie along these
axes and whose sum is equal to a*.  Try to find some, if you like.</p>

<p>As case (ii) shows, the component vectors for a given vector a* are
different if different axes are chosen.  Diagrams (ii.1), (ii.2), and
(iii.3) show the same parallel-projection process, in step-by-step
fashion, and the resulting component vectors for case (ii).</p>

<p>Diagram (iii.1) below shows the parallel projection and resultant
component vectors for case (iii).</p>
