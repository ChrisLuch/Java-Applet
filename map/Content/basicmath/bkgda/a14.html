<h3> <Center>Answer to the August 30, 1996 Question</Center></h3>

<p>Physics 205, Physics 215, Astronomy 211 - A swimming pool can be
filled with two water pipes.  Pipe A alone is able to fill the pool in
one hour.  Pipe B alone is able to fill the pool in two hours.  Pipes
A and B together are able to fill the pool in </p>

<p>(a) 1.5 h</p>

<p>(b) 30 min</p>

<p>(c) 20 min</p>

<p>(d) 40 min</p>

<p>(e) 3 h.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  Choice (d) is the correct one.</p>

<p>The explanation is as follows.  Pipe A pumps water at the rate 1
pool/hour.  Pipe B pumps water at the rate 1 pool/( 2 hour) = 0.5
pool/hour.  The two pipes together pump water at the rate 1.5 pool/hour.</p>

<p>If x hour are required to fill one pool with both pipes, then we
must have the equation</p>

<p><center>1.5 pool/hour  =  1 pool/(x hour).</center></p>

<p>Thus, cancelling the units on both sides, we get the equation</p>

<p><center>1.5  =  1/x.</center></p>

<p>This equation has the solution x = 2/3.  Since we were working with
hours as time unit, the time required for both pumps together to fill
the pool is (2/3) hour or 40 min.</p>
