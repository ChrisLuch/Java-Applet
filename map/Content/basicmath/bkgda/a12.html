<h3> <Center>Answer to the August 16, 1996 Question</Center></h3>

<p>For this question you need to use the definition of average speed.
The definition is as follows.

<center><img src = "images/A11G1.gif"></center>

<p>Suppose somebody drives from city A to city C via city B without
stopping.  The distance d from city A to city B is equal to the
distance from city B to city C.  Suppose also that the driver
maintains an average speed of 80 km/h between cities A and B, but
wants her average speed for the entire trip from city A to city C to
be 100 km/h.  What must be her average trip during the second part of
the journey, from city B to city C?</p>

<p>This problem is not as easy as it may look.  The answer is
<b>not</b> 120 km/h.  Do the problem in two ways.</p>

<p><b>Part (a)</b> Assume that d = 40 km.  Work out the time for the trip
from A to B.  Then work out the total travel time, given the overall
average speed and total distance from A to C.  From these two times
you can find the travel time for the part of the trip from B to C.
Now you can calculate the average speed for this part of the trip.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The average trip during the second part of the
trip, from city B to city C, must be 133.3 km/h.</p>

<p><b>Explanation</b>.  If t1 denotes the time taken to go from A to B
and v1 the average speed for this trip, then t1 = d/v1 = 40/80 =
0.5 h.</p>

<p>If t denotes the total travel time from A to C and v the overall
average speed, then t = 2d/v = 80/100 = 0.8 h.</p>

<p>Therefore, the time t2 required to go from B to C must be t2 = t -
t1 = 0.8 - 0.5 = 0.3 h.</p>
  
<p>This implies an average speed for the trip from B to C equal to v2
= d/t2 = 40/0.3 = 133.3 km/h.</p>

<p><b>Part (b)</b> Now do the entire calculation in symbols, assuming no
special value for the distance d.  Show that the answer is independent
of d.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>.  Repeating the preceding calculation in symbols,
step by step, gives</p>
