<center><h3> Answer to the July 12 Question</h3></center>

<p>Suppose a parabolic mirror is oriented as in the diagram below,
with rays parallel to the optical axis incident from the right.  One
such ray is shown.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  Prove that all rays incident on the mirror
parallel to the optical axis are reflected so that they seem to be
coming from one and the same point on the optical axis, which is again
called the focal point.  Find the distance between this focal point
and the vertex of the mirror.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The following diagram is the same as the one above,
with a few additions.  Added is a ray incident on the mirror from the
left, as in the June 28 question, that is the same distance away from
the optical axis as the ray incident from the right.  Added also are
the two reflected rays (assuming the mirror reflects on both sides)
and the normal to the mirror at the point where the two incident rays
are reflected.  This normal is shown as a stippled line.</p>

<p>The diagram illustrates that ray i1 incident on the mirror from
the right is reflected in such a manner that the reflected ray, r1,
seems to be coming from point F on the optical axis.  Point F is the
focal point of the mirror already discussed in the answer to the June
28 question.  It is the point through which all rays incident on the
mirror from the left that are parallel to the optical axis will be
reflected.  One such pair of incident and reflected rays, rays i2 and
r2, are shown in the diagram.  The reason why all rays incident from
the right parallel to the optical axis will be reflected so that the
reflected rays seem to be coming from the focal point F will now be
explained.</p>

<p>The angles formed between i1 and the normal and i2 and the normal
are equal because these are opposing angles at the intersection of two
straight lines.  Therefore, the angles between r1 and the normal and
r2 and the normal are equal because the law of reflection
demands that the angles of incidence are equal to the angles of
reflection.  (Since the angles of incidence of the two rays i1 and i2
are equal, the corresponding angles of reflection of rays r1 and r2
must be equal as well.)  This implies that rays r1 and r2 together form
a straight line because r1 and r2 are turned relative to i1 and i2 by
equal amounts.  The fact that r1 and r2 form a single straight line
means that r1 seems to be coming from point F since r2 goes through
point F.</p>
   
<p>We know from the answer to the June 28 question that point F is a
distance f = 1/(4c) away from the vertex of the parabola where c is
the parameter in the equation for the parabola.</p>
