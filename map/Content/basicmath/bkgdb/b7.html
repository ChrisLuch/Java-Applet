<h3> <Center>Answer to the June 13, 1997 Question</Center></h3>


<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>Physics 211 - This question and the one next week will deal with
signs, notation, and terminology. <b>(Analytical Geometry.)</b></p>

<p>The following diagram shows two points, P<sub>1</sub> and
P<sub>2</sub>, on an x-axis.  The x-coordinates of the two points are
denoted x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub>, respectively.</p>

<p><u>Definitions</u>. Suppose an object moves from P<sub>1</sub> to
P<sub>2</sub>, then the <u>displacement</u> of the object is defined
as the change in position, i.e., as the difference x<sub>2</sub> -
x<sub>1</sub>.  This difference is also denoted <font
face="symbol">D</font>x = x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> (read: "delta
x").  This displacement must be distinguished from the <u>distance
travelled</u> by the object, which is equal to the distance between
the two points and which in turn is equal to the absolute value
|x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>|. </p>

<p>Note that a distance between two points and the distance travelled
by an object can never be negative, but that a displacement can be
negative.</p>

<p><u>Question</u>. In the diagram above, the direction of the x-axis
is to the right, i.e., the x-values are increasing as one goes to the
right. (This is indicated by having the x-label of the axis on the
right.) Suppose the points P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub> remain
unchanged, but that the direction of the x-axis is reversed.  What are
the signs of the displacement <font face="symbol">D</font>x =
x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> and of the distance travelled by the
object, |x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>| then?  I.e., indicate which
ones, if any, of these quantities are positive and which ones are
negative.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>The diagram below shows an x-axis pointing to the left, opposite to
that in the diagram above.</p>

<p>Now x<sub>1</sub> > x<sub>2</sub> so that x<sub>2</sub> -
x<sub>1</sub> < 0.  For example, if x<sub>1</sub> = 10, then
x<sub>2</sub> = -4 so that x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> = -4 -10 =
-14 < 0.</p>

<p>Thus, the displacement <font face="symbol">D</font>x = <font
face="symbol">D</font>x is alwyas negative for this orientation of the
x-axis.  However, the distance travelled is still positive, by
definition.  In this specific example, it is equal to 14.  (The
SI-units, meters in this case, have been omitted here.)</p>
