<h3> <Center>Answer to the May 23, 1997 Question</Center></h3>


<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>This question is related to the May 16 question.  Suppose a second
car is moving along the same straight line such that its position x at
time t is given by the equation x = 10t + 60, where t is measured in
seconds and x in meters.  At what time and at what position do the two
cars pass each other?  </p>

<p>Solve this problem both analytically, i.e., by means of a
calculation, and graphically.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>The equations for the position vs. time for the two cars are as
follows.  (The equation for the car in the May 16 question is derived
in the answer to that question.)</p>

<p><center>x = -20t + 20&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1)</center></p>
<br>
<p><center>x = 10t + 60.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2)</center></p>
<br>

<p>At the instant when the two cars pass each other, both cars have
the same x-values and the same t-values.  Therefore, we can find the
common x and t by equating the x in equation (1) to the x in equation
(2) and similarly for t.</p>

<p>Thus, the left-hand sides of equations (1) and (2) are equal.
Therefore, the right-hand sides must be equal as well.  This gives</p>

<p><center>10t + 60 = -20t + 20.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(3)</center></p>

<p>Moving the terms with t to the left-hand side, by adding 20t to
both sides of the equation, and moving the constant terms to the
right-hand side, by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation,
gives</p>

<p><center>10t + 20t =  20 - 60&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(4)</center></p>
or
<center>30t = -40.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(5)</center></p>

<p>Dividing both sides of equation (5) by 30 gives us t,</p>

<p><center>t = -40/30 = -4/3 = -1.33 s.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(6)</center></p>

<p>Substituting this value of t into equation (1) gives</p>

<p><center>x = -20x(-1.33) + 20 = 46.7
m.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(7)</center></p>

<p>You should check that you get the same value for x if you
substitute value (6) for t into equation (2).  This is a consistency
check that shows that we did not make a silly mistake in our
calculation.</p>

<p>Another check that the answers (6) and (7) are correct is obtained
by graphing the two functions (1) and (2).  The intersection point of
the two straight lines is the point where both lines have the same
x-values and the same t-values.  Thus, the intersection point is the
point where the two cars are passing each other.  As you see from the
graph below, this point does indeed have the coordinates (6) and
(7).</p>
