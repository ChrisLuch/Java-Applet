<p><b>Question (a).</b>&nbspThe graph of the equation x = at + b is a
straight line (as long as the t and x axes use linear scales, i.e.,
scales on which equal increments of t and x are represented by equal
distances).  Why is this so?  What kind of an equation relating x to t
would result in a nonlinear graph?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>The graph is a straight line because the variables x and t occur in
the first power.  If x and t occur in the first power, the average
slope of the graph has the same value for all t-intervals.  This is
only possible if the graph is a straight line.  What is meant by
average slope and how can one show that it is constant?</p>

<p>The average slope of a graph of x vs. t over a given interval is
defined as the ratio of (change in x)/(change in t).  Let
t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub> be two t-values and x<sub>1</sub> and
x<sub>2</sub> the corresponding x-values.  The given equation relates
these t and x values as follows:</p>

<p><center>x<sub>2</sub>=at<sub>2</sub>+b</p></center>
<p><center>x<sub>1</sub>=at<sub>1</sub>+b</p></center>

<p>Subtracting the second equation from the first one gives</p>

<p><center>x<sub>2</sub>-x<sub>1</sub>=a(t<sub>2</sub>-t<sub>1</sub>)</center></p>

<p>whence the average slope over the interval from t<sub>1</sub> to
t<sub>2</sub> is equal to</p>

<p><center>average slope =
(x<sub>2</sub>-x<sub>1</sub>)/(t<sub>2</sub>-t<sub>1</sub>) = a =
const.</center></p>

<p>To get a graph that is not a straight line, one only has to choose
the power of x or t or both to be different from one.  For example,
the graph of x = at<sup>2</sup>+b is not a straight line because t is
raised to the second power.  It is a parabola.</p>

<p><b>Question (b).</b>&nbspWhich quantities on the graph in part (a) represent
the quantities a and b?  Illustrate this by drawing the graphs
corresponding to (i) a = 1.5 and b = -2 and (ii) a = -0.5 and b = 1.
Put t on the horizontal axis and x on the vertical axis.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The two graphs are shown below.</p>

<center><img src="images/b/b2G1.gif"></center>

<p>As the calculation in part (a) shows, the parameter "a" is equal to
the slope of the graph.  Indeed, the slope of graph (i) is equal to
1.5.  As t increases from 0 to 2, x increases from -2 to +1.  Thus, as
t changes by 2, x changes by 3, so that slope = (change in x)/(change
in t) = 3/2 = 1.5.  Similarly, the slope of graph (ii) is equal to
-0.5 because as t increases from 0 to 2, x changes from 1 to 0.  Thus,
for a change in t by 2 we have a change in x by -1, so that the slope
is equal to -1/2 = -0.5.</p>

<p>How do graphs (i) and (ii) show the values of b in the two cases?
Substituting t = 0 into the equation x = at + b, gives x = b.  Thus, b
is equal to the value of x corresponding to t = 0.  In other words, b
is equal to the intercept of the graph with the x-axis (since t = 0
for all points along the x-axis.)  Indeed graphs (i) and (ii) intercept the x-axis at x = -2 and x = 1, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Question (c).</b>&nbspFor the two graphs in part (b), what are
the values of the intercepts with the t-axis?  How would you calculate
these intercepts?  Do the calculated values agree with those shown by
the graphs?  What is the physical interpretation of these
intercepts?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>All points on the t-axis have x = 0.  Thus, we must set x = 0 in
the equation x=at+b to find the intercept with the t-axis.  Thus,</p>

<p><center>0=at+b&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwhence&nbsp
&nbsp&nbspat=-b&nbsp&nbsp&nbspt=-b/a.</center></p>

<p>Substituting the given values for a and b, we obtain</p>

<p><center>(i)&nbspt=-(-2)/1.5=1.33&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(ii)
&nbspt=-1/(-0.5)=2.</center></p>

<p>These values agree with the t-axis intercepts on the graphs.</p>

<p>These t-axis intercepts show the times at which the object passes
the point x = 0.</p>

<p><b>Question (d).</b>&nbspNow graph the two cases (i) and (ii) from
part (b) so that x is on the horizontal axis and t is on the vertical
axis.  What are the physical interpretations of the intercepts with
the two axes now?  Do the values of these intercepts as shown by the
graphs agree with the values that can be calculated from the given
equation?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The two graphs are shown below.</p>

<center><img src="images/b/b2G2.gif"></center>

<p>The physical interpretations of the intercepts with the x and t
axes are the same as before and the values of these intercepts are the
same as before, except that the x-intercept is now on the horizontal
and the t-intercept now on the vertical axis.</p>

<p><b>Question (e).</b>&nbspDetermine the slopes of the graphs of x
vs. t and t vx. x obtained in parts (b) and (d), respectively.  How
are these slopes related?  Can you explain why the slopes are related
the way they are?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>Let us do this for graph (i) only.  To repeat the same calculations
for graph (ii) is left as an exercise for you, the reader.</p>

<p>The slope of the x vs. t graph in part (b) is equal to a = 1.5 =
3/2.  The slope of the t vs. x graph in part (d) is equal to 2/3 =
0.67.  (As x increases from -2 to 0, t increases from 0 to 4/3; thus
the slope is equal to (4/3)/2 = 2/3.)  The product of the slopes in
parts (b) and (d) is equal to (3/2)x(2/3)=1.</p>

<p>When plotting a straight-line graph of x vs. t and the
corresponding straight-line graph of t vs. x, the product of the two
slopes is always equal to 1.  Or, equivalently, the slope of the graph
in part (d) is the reciprocal of that of the graph in part (b).  This
can be understood as follows.  When plotting x vs. t, the slope is
equal to (change in x)/(change in t).  This is obviously the
reciprocal of (change in t)/(change in x), which is the slope of the t
vs. x graph.</p>

<p>As an exercise, you may want to solve the equation x=at+b for t and
show that the result is t=(1/a)x-b/a.  This too shows that the slope
of the t vs. x graph is equal to 1/a, i.e., equal to the reciprocal of
the slope of the x vs. t graph.</p>
