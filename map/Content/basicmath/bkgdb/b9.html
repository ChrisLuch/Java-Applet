<h3> <Center>Answer to the June 27, 1997 Question</Center></h3>


<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>Physics 211 - Please refer back to the June 13, 1997 Question, in
particular the definitions of displacement and distance travelled, and
to the June 20, 1997 Question, which has examples of graphs.  These
questions are available in the Question Archive.  <b>(Analytical
Geometry.  Graphs.)</b></p>

<p>Suppose a hiker leaves his camp at time t = 0 in the morning and
returns to his camp two hours later.  Various hypothetical graphs of
distance travelled, s, vs. time elapsed, t, for the hike are shown
above.</p>

<p>Which graph (or graphs) could represent the distance travelled by
the hiker vs. time elapsed?  Give reasons, both for the possible and
the impossible graphs.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>Graph (c) is the only one that could represent the distance
travelled by the hiker vs. the time elapsed.  The four graphs will now
be discussed in alphabetical sequence.</p>

<p><u>Graph (a)</u>. Graph (a) is two-valued, i.e., for a given t, it
gives two values of s.  This is impossible.  When a certain amount of
time t has elapsed, only one distance s can have been travelled.</p>

<p><u>Graph (b)</u>. Graph (b) shows an s that is non-zero at the
start of the motion at t = 0.  That is impossible.  At the start of
the motion, the distance travelled since the start must be zero.</p>

<p>Also, graph (b) shows s to be decreasing at first.  That is
impossible.  The distance travelled is an additive quantity that can
never decrease.  It can remain constant, when the travelling object is
at rest, or it can increase, when the travelling object is moving.
</p>

<p><u>Graph (c)</u>.  This graph is possible: s starts at s = 0 at the
start of the motion at t = 0, and s is increasing all the time.  At
any given time, s has a unique value.</p>

<p><u>Graph (d)</u>.  This graph is impossible because s is decreasing
in the right half of the graph.  See the second paragraph of the
discussion of graph (b).</p>
