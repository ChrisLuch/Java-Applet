<h3> <Center>Answer to the August 8, 1997 Question</Center></h3>

<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>Physics 211 - For the following two graphs of position x vs. time
t, determine the values of the velocity at t = 2 s and t = 4
s. <b>(Graphs.)</b></p>

<p>For graph (a), it should be possible to come up with a fairly
accurate value of the velocity v.  However, for graph (b), one can
determine only a pretty rough value.  In case (b), it may help if you
hold a ruler against the screen.</p>

<p>Hint: Remember that the velocity at a time t is equal to the slope
of the position vs. time graph at that time t.  The slope of a graph
at a given point is equal to the slope of the tangent to the graph at
that point.  In the case of a straight-line graph, the tangent is
identical with the straight line.  In the case of a curved graph, the
tangent at a point is the straight line that touches the graph at that
point, but does not intersect it.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p><b>Graph (a).</b> For a straight line graph, the slope has the same
value everywhere, equal to the ratio rise/run of the straight line.
The velocity values at t = 2 s and t = 4 s are both equal to this
slope.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows graph (a) with a rise-run triangle
(dashed) to calculate the slope.</p>

<p>We make the rise-run triangle as large as possible to get as
accurate a value for the slope as possible.  The "rise" <font
face="symbol">D</font>x is equal to -40 m because x changes from 20 m
to -20 m as we go from left to right along the graph.  The
corresponding run is <font face="symbol">D</font>t = 6 s because t
changes from -1 s to 5 s as we go from left to right along the
graph.</p>

<p>Thus, the slope of the straight line, and therefore the velocity v
at both t = 2 s and t = 4 s, is equal to </p>

<p>

<p><center>v = <font face="symbol">D</font>x/<font
face="symbol">D</font>t = -40 m/6 s = -6.7 m/s.</center></p>

<p>

<p><b>Graph (b).</b> For a curved graph, the slope has different values
at different points of the graph.</p>

<p>At t = 2 s, the x vs. t graph is horizontal.  Thus, the slope and
therefore the velocity is 0 at t = 2 s.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows graph (b) with a tangent drawn at the point
t = 4 s.  The tangent is shown as a solid line.  A rise-run triangle
to determine the slope of this tangent is shown with dashed lines.</p>

<p>As you can see, for a run <font face="symbol">D</font>t of 2 s, as t
changes from 3 s to 5 s, the rise <font face="symbol">D</font>x is
approximately 16 m, as x changes from -20 m to - 4 m.</p>

<p>Thus, the slope of the graph at t = 4 s, and therefore the velocity
at this instant, is equal to</p>

<p>

<p><center>v = <font face="symbol">D</font>x/<font
face="symbol">D</font>t = 16 m/2 s = 8 m/s.</center></p>
