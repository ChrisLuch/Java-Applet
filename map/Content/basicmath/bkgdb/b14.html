<h3> <Center>Answer to the August 1, 1997 Question</Center></h3>


<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>Physics 211 - In the July 18 and 25, 1997 questions you were asked
to start from a displacement vs. time graph and find the corresponding
velocity vs. time graph.  Today you will be asked to do the
opposite.  <b>(Graphs.)</b></p>

<p>Consider once more the four velocity vs. time graphs shown below.<p>

<p>For each of the four cases (a) to (d), draw (i) the corresponding
displacement vs. time graph that has <font face="symbol">D</font>x = 0
at t = 0, (ii) the position vs. time graph that has x = 10 m at t = 0, and
(iii) the position vs. time graph that has x = -10 m at t = 0.</p>

<p>Hint: Review the answer to the July 25, 1997 question.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b></p>

<p>(i) The following diagram shows <font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t
corresponding to the cases (a) to (d).  Note that <font
face="symbol">D</font>x starts with 0 at t = 0 in all four cases, as
stipulated above.  The slope of <font face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t at
any given time t is equal to the value of v at that time that is shown
in the corresponding graph above. </p>

<p>(ii) The following diagram shows x vs. t corresponding to the cases
(a) to (d).  Note that x = 10 m at t = 0 in all four cases, as
stipulated above.  The slope of x vs. t at any given time t is equal
to the value of v at that time that is shown in the corresponding graph
above. The graphs of x vs. t are identical in shape to those of <font
face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t above, but are shifted upward by 10
m.</p>

<p>(iii) The following diagram shows x vs. t corresponding to the cases
(a) to (d).  Note that x = -10 m at t = 0 in all four cases, as
stipulated above.  The slope of x vs. t at any given time t is equal
to the value of v at that time that is shown in the corresponding graph
above. The graphs of x vs. t are identical in shape to those of <font
face="symbol">D</font>x vs. t above, but are shifted downward by 10
m.</p>
