<h4>May 2, 1997</h4>

<p>Physics 211, Astronomy 211 - A car is moving with constant velocity
so that its position coordinate x at time t is equal to x = at + b,
where a and b are constants.  Solve this equation for t. <b>

<h4>May 9, 1997</h4>

<p>Physics 211, Astronomy 211 - This question is concerned with the
graph of the equation x = at + b, from the May 2, 1997 question.
Graphs are used a great deal in physics and other sciences because
they allow you to collect a lot of information in a form that can
easily be visualized.&nbsp<b>(Graphs. Algebra.)</b></p>

<p><b>(a)</b><spacer type="horizontal" size="2">The graph of this
equation is a straight line (as long as the t and x axes use linear
scales, i.e., scales on which equal increments of t and x are
represented by equal distances).  Why is this so?  What kind of an
equation relating x to t would result in a nonlinear graph?</p>

<p><b>(b)</b><spacer type="horizontal" size="2">Which quantities on
the graph represent the quantities a and b?  Illustrate this by
drawing the graphs corresponding to (i) a = 1.5 and b = -2 and (ii) a
= -0.5 and b = 1.  Put t on the horizontal axis and x on the vertical
axis.</p>

<p><b>(c)</b><spacer type="horizontal" size="2">For the two graphs in
part (b), determine the intercepts with the t-axis.  Do the calculated
values agree with those shown by the graphs?  What is the physical
interpretation of these intercepts?</p>

<p><b>(d)</b><spacer type="horizontal" size="2">Now graph the two
cases (i) and (ii) from part (b) so that x is on the horizontal axis
and t is on the vertical axis.  What are the physical interpretations
of the intercepts with the two axes now?  Do the values of the
intercepts as shown by the graphs agree with the values that can be
calculated from the given equation?</p>

<p><b>(e)</b><spacer type="horizontal" size="2">Determine the slopes
of the graphs of x vs. t and t vx. x obtained in parts (b) and (d),
respectively.  How are these slopes related?  Can you explain why the
slopes are related the way they are?</p>

<p><b>May 16, 1997</b></p>

<p>Physics 211, Astronomy 211 - A car is moving with constant speed
along a straight line.  (This is the same as saying the car is moving
with constant velocity.)  Let the straight line be called the x-axis.
Suppose that at t = -4 s the car is at x = 100 m and at t = 2 s the
car is at x=-20 m.  Plot an x vs. t graph of the car's motion, and
derive an equation relating the car's position x to the time
t.&nbsp<b>(Analytical geometry.)</b></p>

<p>Hint: Velocity is defined as (change in position)/(change in time).
Here, the velocity is given to be constant.</p>

<p><b>May 23, 1997</b></p>

<p>Physics 211, Astronomy 211 - This question is related to the May 16
question.  Suppose a second car is moving along the same straight line
such that its position x at time t is given by the equation x = 10t +
60, where t is measured in seconds and x in meters.  At what time and
at what position do the two cars pass each other?&nbsp<b>(Algebra. Graphs.)</b></p>

<p>Solve this problem both analytically, i.e., by means of a
calculation, and graphically.</p>

<p><b>May 30, 1997</b></p>

<p>Physics 211 - (This is a challenge question.  It contains concepts
that you are not expected to have studied before beginning the
course.)  Let us consider once more the car from the May 16 question.
The position x of the car as a function of the time t could be
described by the equation x = -20t + 20.&nbsp<b>(Analytical
Geometry. Graphs.)</b></p>

<p>Suppose you have a reference frame, called the <u>car's frame</u>,
in which this car is at rest, i.e., a reference frame that is moving
at the car's velocity relative to the road.  The frame in which the
road is at rest is called the <u>road's frame</u>.  In the car's
frame, the car's position is constant.  Let x' denote the position
coordinate in the car's frame.  (x is the position coordinate in the
road's frame.)  Let us choose the origin of the car's frame, x' = 0,
so that the constant position of the car in this frame is equal to x'
= 20 m, at all times.</p>

<p>Hint: You can think of the car's frame as an (infinitely) long
ruler rigidly attached to the car, aligned with the direction in which
the car is moving, and moving with the car.  The ruler is used for
measuring the positions of objects.  Thus, to determine the value of
the position of an object in the car's frame at a given time, i.e.,
the object's x'-value at that time, one simply records where on the
ruler the object is at that time.  The car itself is at x' = 20 m on
this ruler.  The origin of the ruler is outside of the car.</p>

<p><b>(a)</b>.<spacer type="horizontal" size="3">Using the same set of
x,t axes as for the x vs. t graph of the motion of the car in the May
16 question, show the x vs. t graph of a second car that is at rest at
the origin of the car's frame, i.e., for which x' = 0 at all
times.</p>


<p><b>(b)</b>.<spacer type="horizontal" size="3">Do the same as in part
(a), but for a car that is at rest at x' = 40 m.</p>

<p><b>(c)</b>.<spacer type="horizontal" size="3">What are the distances
between the three cars (i) in the frame in which the road is at rest
and (ii) in the car's frame?</p>
