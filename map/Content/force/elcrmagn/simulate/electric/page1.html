        <div class="title">One or Several Charged Particles In An Electric
        Field</div>

        <p><b>Preparation</b>: Force/Electromagnetic/Explain It/Electric
        Force.</p>

        <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the motion of a charged particle in
        a uniform electric field.  The applet can also simulate simultaneous
        motions of two or twelve charged particles.

        <p>For details on how to use the applet, please go to Applet Help on
        the applet's Help menu.  There is also a lesson available under Applet
        Help with exercises to be carried out with the applet.
