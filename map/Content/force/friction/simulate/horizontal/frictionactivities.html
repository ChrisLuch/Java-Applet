    <div class="title">Activities on Static and Kinetic Friction Between a
    Block and a Horizontal Table</div>

    <p>
      The following Activities are for the Static and Kinetic Friction
      applet.  Make sure you know how the applet functions by consulting
      Help, Assumptions, and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's
      Help menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 1</b>.  The purpose of Activity 1 is to determine the
      static coefficient of friction <font
      face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub> between the block and the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      RESET the applet. Set the static coefficient of friction to 0.30.
      Pretend you don't know this value and want to determine it
      'experimentally' with the applet.  Do so as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Increase the magnitude of the force applied to the block until the
      block's acceleration becomes non-zero.  Keep the direction of the
      applied force horizontal.  What is the magnitude of the (static)
      friction force just before the block's acceleration becomes
      non-zero?  The information is available from the data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that the static coefficient of friction <font
      face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub> determines the maximum magnitude
      of the static friction force via
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>F<sub>fric,max</sub></i> = <font
      face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub> <i>N</i> <img
      src="small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40">(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      where <i>N</i> is the magnitude of the normal force.  An equation
      for the magnitude of the nomal force can be obtained by applying
      Newton's second law in the <i>y</i>-direction (vertical direction)
      to the block.  When the applied force is horizontal, only the
      normal force and the force of gravity acting on the block have a
      non-zero <i>y</i>-component.  Since <i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = 0,
      Newton's seond law implies that
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>N</i> - <i>mg</i> = 0 <img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40">(2)
    </p>
      whence
    <p align="center">
      <i>N</i> = <i>mg</i> .<img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40">(3)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, <i>m</i> is the mass of the block and <i>g</i> the magnitude
      of the acceleration due to gravity, which is taken to be equal to
      9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> in the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Substitute Expression (3) for <i>N</i> into Eq.(1), and use the
      resulting equation with the given and observed values to calculate
      <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub>.  Compare your result to
      the value set earlier with the slider.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 2</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is to determine
      the kinetic coefficient of friction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continue with the applet in the same state as in Activity 1, i.e.,
      with <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub> = 0.30 and the data
      box open.  Determine the kinetic coefficient of friction <font
      face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub> as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust the magnitude of the applied force so that it is just enough
      to cause the block's acceleration to be non-zero.  This should be
      at <i>F<sub>appl</sub></i> = 14.8 N if the applied force is
      horizontal.  Make sure the force is horizontal.  PLAY/STEP the
      motion up to <i>t</i> = 2.00 s and PAUSE at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the block's displacement in 2.00 s, determine the block's
      acceleration using the equation relating displacement,
      acceleration, and time elapsed for motion with constant
      acceleration.  Compare your result with the value of
      <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> in the data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apply Newton's second law to the block to calculate the
      <i>x</i>-component of the net force acting on the block,
      <i>F<sub>x</sub></i>, from the acceleration and the mass of the
      block.  From this and the value of <i>F<sub>appl,x</sub></i>,
      calculate the value of the <i>x</i>-component of the friction
      force, <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i>.  Compare your result with the
      value in the data box.  There may be a slight difference due to
      round-off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the block is moving in this case, we are dealing with kinetic
      friction.  Use the equation defining the coefficient of kinetic
      friction <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub>,
    </p>
    <p align="center"> 
      <i>F<sub>fric</sub></i> = <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub>
      <i>N</i>, <img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1"
      width="40">(4)
    </p>
    <p>
      combined with Expression (3) for <i>N</i> to calculate <font
      face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub>.  Compare your result with the
      value to which the Kinetic Coefficient of Friction slider is set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 3</b>.  The purpose of this activity is to investigate
      if the force of kinetic friction and the kinetic coefficient of
      friction depend on the applied force.
    </p>
    <p>
      REWIND the applet, and set the magnitude of the applied force to
      20.0 N.  Keep the applied force horizontal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again determine the force of kinetic friction and the kinetic
      coefficient of friction, using the same procedure as in Activity 2.
      Are the results the same as before?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 4</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is to determine if
      the magnitude of the force of kinetic friction is proportional to
      the magnitude <i>N</i> of the normal force or to the weight
      <i>F<sub>grav</sub></i> = <i>mg</i> of the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to distinguish between <i>N</i> and
      <i>F<sub>grav</sub></i>, we must set up a situation in which the
      two quantities have different values.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do so, set the magnitude of the applied force to 15.0 N and the
      direction angle <font face="symbol">q</font> of the applied force
      to 30<sup>o</sup>.  Both from the data box and the free-body
      diagram, you can see that <i>N</i> < <i>F<sub>grav</sub></i> in
      this case.  This time, we'll pretend we know the kinetic
      coefficient of friction: 0.24.  Make sure the slider is set to this
      value.  However, let's pretend we just don't know whether to
      multiply it by <i>N</i> or <i>mg</i> to get the magnitude of the
      force of kinetic friction.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in Activity 1, derive an expression for <i>N</i> by applying
      Newton's second law to the block.  Again, the vertical component
      <i>a<sub>y</sub></i> of the acceleration is 0.  Thus, as in Eq.(2),
      the sum of the <i>y</i>-components of all forces acting on the
      block is 0.  However, in the present case, there are three, not
      two, forces that have a non-zero <i>y</i>-component.  The applied
      force is the third one.  Thus, with <i>F<sub>appl,y</sub></i> =
      <i>F<sub>appl</sub> sin</i> <font face="symbol">q</font>,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>N</i> - <i>mg</i> + <i>F<sub>appl</sub> sin</i> <font
      face="symbol">q</font> = 0<img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40">(5)
    </p>
      whence
    <p align="center">
      <i>N</i> = <i>mg</i> - <i>F<sub>appl</sub> sin</i> <font
      face="symbol">q</font>.<img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40">(6)
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculate <i>N</i> from Eq.(6), and compare the result to the value
      in the data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then use Eq.(4) to calculate the magnitude of the force of kinetic
      friction.  Is the result consistent with the value of
      <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i> displayed in the data box?  
    </p>
    <p>
      Now calculate the block's acceleration <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> by
      applying Newton's second law to the block,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <i>F<sub>appl,x</sub></i> + <i>F<sub>fric,x</sub></i> =
      <i>F<sub>appl</sub> sin</i> <font face="symbol">q</font> - <font
      face="symbol">m</font><sub>k</sub> <i>N</i> =
      <i>ma<sub>x</sub></i>.<img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40">(7)
    </p>
    <p>
      Substitute the given values into Eq.(7), and calculate
      <i>a<sub>x</sub></i>.  Does the result agree with the value in the
      data box?
    </p>
    <p>
      Predict the block's displacement <font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i> during a time interval of 2.00 s.
      Then PLAY the applet, and check if your prediction agrees with the
      displacement you observe.  If it does, then using <i>N</i> rather
      than <i>mg</i> in Expression (4) for the magnitude of the force of
      kinetic friction is the right thing to do.  Using <i>mg</i> instead
      of <i>N</i> in this expression would have resulted in a different
      value for <font face="symbol">D</font><i>x</i>.  You may want to do
      the calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 5</b>.  Design an experiment, to be carried out with
      the applet, that let's you decide whether Expression (1) for the
      maximum magnitude of the force of static friction should have
      <i>N</i> or <i>F<sub>grav</sub></i> on the right-hand side
      multiplying <font face="symbol">m</font><sub>s</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carry out the experiment.
    </p>
