<p align="center"><b>Newton's Third Law</b>

<p>Both experiments, with the two skaters or the two blocks, have the
same outcome: both skaters or both blocks end up moving away from each
other, the less massive object moving faster than the more massive one.

<p>Even though Tracy is trying to push Alex and Alex is not trying to
push Tracy, Alex still ends up pushing Tracy.  This is a law of nature
called <i>Newton's Third Law</i>.

<p><b>Newton's Third Law</b>:

<dir>

<p>If an object A exerts a force on another object B, then object B
also exerts a force on object A.  Moreover, both forces always
have the same magnitude and opposite directions.

</dir>

<p><b>Wanting</b> to exert a force or <b>not</b> has nothing to do
with it.  Neither the two blocks, nor Alex and Tracy, have any control
over the fact that the forces they are exerting on each other are
exactly equal in magnitude.  Although Tracy can exert more or less
force on Alex, Alex will necessarily push Tracy with exactly as much
force as Tracy exerts on him, whether he wants to or not.

<p>A pair of forces resulting from the interaction between <b>two</b>
objects A and B is called an <i>action-reaction</i> pair of forces.
One of these forces acts on object A, the other one on object B.
