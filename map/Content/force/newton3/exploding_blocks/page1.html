 <p>
  The applet is on Page 2.  It shows two skaters pushing off from each
      other or, alternatively, two blocks that are being forced
      apart. It demonstrates the resulting momenta, speeds, and
      kinetic energies of the two skaters or blocks.
 </p>
 <p>
   Detailed information on how the applet functions is available under
   Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.  A lesson on momentum,
   momentum conservation, and related matters is available there as
   well.
