    <div class="title">Activities on Forces and Their Reaction Forces
    Within a Box-Table-Earth System</div>

    <p>
      The following Activities are for the Box-on-Table applet.  Make
      sure you know how the applet functions by consulting Help,
      Assumptions, and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's Help
      menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 1</b>.  The purpose of Activity 1 is to learn to
      identify the Newton's-third law reaction force corresponding to a
      given force.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>.  Review Newton's third law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that a force and the corresponding reaction force
      <b>always</b> act on different objects, <b>never</b> on the same
      object.  Thus, a force and the corresponding reaction force always
      occur in different free-body diagrams.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, an action force and its reaction partner always arise from
      one and the same interaction between two objects.  Thus, if the
      interaction involved is gravitational in nature, both the action
      and the reaction force are gravitational forces.  Or, if the action
      force is a normal contact force, then so is its reaction partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>. RESET the applet.  Set the applet to the
      Reaction Force mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the Force drop-down menus to select the gravitational force
      exerted by the earth on the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      In your Notebook, make a drawing of the box-table-earth system.
      Also, start making free-body diagrams for the box, the table, and the
      earth by drawing a dot for each of these elements of the system,
      labeling the dots "Box", "Table", and "Earth" as in the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both in your drawing of the box-table-earth system and in the
      appropriate free-body diagrams, draw the arrows representing the
      gravitational force exerted by the earth on the box and the
      corresponding Newton's-third-law reaction force.  The tail end of a
      force vector should be placed at the point where the force is
      acting, which effectively is the center of gravity of an object in
      the case of a gravitational force acting on the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the Force drop-down menus to select the gravitational force
      exerted by the earth on the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write down the verbal description of the reaction force.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUBMIT your selection, and compare the applet's response with what
      you have drawn and written.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>.  Continuing from Exercise 2, one of the two force
      vectors included in the applet's free-body diagram for the box, the
      gravitational force vector, is shown selected in green while the
      other vector is unselected and shown in grey.  Select the unselected
      grey vector with the Force drop-down menus, and add this other force
      vector and the corresponding reaction force to your free-body
      diagrams and your drawing of the box-table-earth system.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUBMIT your entry, and compare the applet's response.  Does the
      applet select the previously unselected vector in the free-body
      diagram of the box?  If so, you have correctly identified this force
      by its verbal description.  If not, change your selection and SUBMIT
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does the applet indicate the reaction force that you have in your
      drawings?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 4</b>.  Repeat Exercises 2 and 3 for the forces in the
      free-body diagrams for the table and the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 2</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is to provide
      further practice with Newton's-third-law reaction forces.  This
      time, the applet will randomly select a force and you are expected
      to select the corresponding reaction force.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Select the Reaction Force
      Review mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet chooses a force by selecting both the force vector in
      one of the three free-body diagrams and the verbal description of
      the force via the Force drop-down menus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respond by selecting the corresponding Newton's-third-law reaction
      force either in one of the free-body diagrams or from the Reaction
      Force drop-down menus.  Also add the force chosen by the applet and
      the reaction force chosen by you to your drawings.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUBMIT your response.  If the applet responds with "Correct" in the
      Answer Quality text field, click NEXT and continue with the next
      force.  Otherwise, change your response and SUBMIT again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Continue in this manner until the applet has
      gone through all eight forces indicated in the three free-body
      diagrams.
