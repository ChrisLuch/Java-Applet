    <p>
      The applet on Page 2 shows forces and their Newton's-third-law
      reaction forces acting on the parts of a system consisting of a box
      on a table which is standing on the earth.  The system is pictured
      below.  Of course, the three parts of the system are not
      illustrated to scale.

      Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.

      See "Activities" under Related Items for suggestions on
      investigations on forces and their reaction forces to be carried
      out with the applet.
