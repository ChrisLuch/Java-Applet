  <p>
    When two objects are in direct contact, each object exerts a
    "contact" force on the other one. The component of the contact
    force that is perpendicular to the surface of contact is called
    the <i>normal force</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
	 The component of the contact force that lies in the surface of
    contact is called <i>friction</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    E.g., imagine a block on an incline, as illustrated in the figure
    below.  The normal force exerted by the incline on the block is
    represented by the blue arrow labeled <img src="N.gif" alt="vector
    N" align="bottom">.  The red arrow labeled <img src="F.gif"
    alt="vector F" align="bottom"> represents the friction force.
    (The friction force is directed down the incline, as in the
    figure, when the block is moving up the incline.)
  </p>

  </p>

  <p>
    Contact forces are basically electromagnetic forces between the
    molecules at the surfaces of the contacting objects.  Thus,
    <b>the</b> normal force exerted on the block is the sum of many,
    many tiny normal forces exerted on the molecules of the block at
    the block's surface that is in contact with the incline.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the illustration above, the normal force is shown to be acting
    on the block at the center point of the bottom surface of the
    block.  In situations where torques need to be considered, the
    point where this one total normal force is acting may have to be
    chosen elsewhere.  This point is determined by the requirement
    that the total normal force produce the same torque as the many
    tiny normal forces together.

  <p>
    The friction force <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom">
    illustrated above, like the normal force <img src="N.gif"
    alt="vector N" align="bottom">, is the sum of many tiny friction
    forces distributed all over the surface of contact.
