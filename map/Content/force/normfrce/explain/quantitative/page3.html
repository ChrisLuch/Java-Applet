  <div class="title">Normal Force</div>

<p><b>Explanation</b>.  Let the explanation be in terms of the
situation simulated on the left, and let us do the calculation in the
Lab frame, which is an inertial frame so that Newton's second law
holds in this frame.</p>

<p>The free-body diagram for the 2.0-kg object is shown on the far
left.  Two forces are acting on the object, the downward gravitational
force of magnitude <i>W</i> and the upward normal force of magnitude
<i>N</i>.  The gravitational force is exerted on the object by the
earth, and the normal force is exerted on the object by the springs.
The normal force is a contact force.  Since nothing besides the
springs is in contact with the 2.0-kg object, there are no other
contact forces acting on the object.  (It is true that the air is in
contact with the object, but let us ignore the forces exerted on the
object by the air.)

<p>We can calculate the normal force by applying Newton's second law
to the 2.0-kg object.  Considering the y-components gives</p>

<p>

<div class="equation"><i>N</i> - <i>W</i> = <i>ma</i> </div>

<p>where <i>a</i> is the y-component of the acceleration.  Substituting
<i>W</i> = <i>mg</i> and solving for <i>N</i> gives</p>

<p>

<div class="equation"><i>N</i> = <i>m</i>(<i>g</i> + <i>a</i>) .</div>

<p>Thus, for <i>a</i> = 2.0 m s<sup>-2</sup> and <i>m</i> = 2.0 kg we
get</p>

<div class="equation"><i>N</i> = 2.0 x (9.8 + 2.0) = 23.6 N .</div>

<p>Analogously, for <i>m</i> = 60 kg one gets</p>

<div class="equation"><i>N</i> = 60 x (9.8 + 2.0) = 708 N</div>

<p>which amounts to an equivalent mass of </p>

<div class="equation"><i>m<sub>equ</sub></i> = 708/9.8 = 72.2 kg .</p>
