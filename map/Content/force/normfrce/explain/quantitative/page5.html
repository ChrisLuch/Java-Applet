  <div class="title">Normal Force</div>

<p><b>A bathroom scale measures the magnitude of the normal force
exerted by the scale on the object resting on the scale</b>.  Consider
the diagram on the left.  It shows the motion frozen at an instant
when the block is accelerating upward with an acceleration of
magnitude 2.0 m s<sup>-2</sup>.  The free-body diagram on the far left
shows the two forces acting on the 2.0-kg object.  In addition, the
forces acting on the springs are shown.</p>

<p>The downward forces exerted by the 2.0-kg object on the springs are
represented as a single downward force of magnitude <i>N'</i> acting
on the middle spring.  This is to simplify the diagram.  This downward
force is the reaction force, in the sense of Newton's third law, to
the upward normal force of magnitude <i>N</i> exerted by the springs
on the 2.0-kg object.  Therefore, <i>N'</i> = <i>N</i>, no matter how
the object is accelerating, although the values of <i>N</i> and
<i>N'</i> do depend on the acceleration.</p>

<p>There is an upward force exerted by the table on the springs.  This
force must also have magnitude <i>N'</i>, <b>if</b> the springs are
massless.  We will assume that the mass of the springs is negligible.
The reason that the upward and downward forces exerted on the springs
must have the same magnitudes lies in Newton's <b>second</b> law, as
applied to the springs.  When the springs have zero mass, the product
<i>ma</i> is zero for the springs.  Therefore, the net force acting on
the springs must be zero.  This is only possible if the upward and
downward forces, exerted on the springs by the table and the 2.0-kg
object, respectively, have the same magnitude <i>N'</i>.

<p>Thus, the springs experience forces at both ends of magnitude
<i>N'</i> = <i>N</i>, and the length of the springs adjusts itself
accordingly.  The greater <i>N'</i>, the shorter the springs.  The
length of the springs is translated by a mechanism into the reading
given by the scale.  Thus, the scale reads the magnitude <i>N</i> of
the normal force exerted by the scale on the object resting on the
scale.</p>
