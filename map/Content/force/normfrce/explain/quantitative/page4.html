  <div class="title">Normal Force</div>

<p><b>Observe</b> that the normal force is <b>not</b> equal to the
weight of the object.  For the 2.0-kg object on the left, the normal
force is 23.6 N while the weight is 19.6 N, and for a 60-kg object the
normal force is 708 N while the weight is equal to 60x9.8 = 588 N,
always assuming a 2.0 m s<sup>-2</sup> upward acceleration.</p>

<p>An important lesson for you to learn is that in general the normal
force is <b>not</b> equal in magnitude to the object's weight, because
the normal force is <b>not</b> the reaction force to the gravitational
force, in the sense of Newton's third law.  If these two forces were an
action-reaction pair, their magnitudes would have to be equal no
matter how the object is accelerating.</p>

<p>The normal force <b>varies</b> with the object's acceleration and
must be determined using Newton's <b>second</b> law, as in the
calculation on Page 3.  In contrast, the object's weight always is
19.6 N no matter how the object is accelerating.  The same is true for
the reaction force to the force of gravity acting on the object,
namely, the upward force that the object exerts on the entire earth.
This reaction force always has the same magnitude of 19.6 N equal to
the object's weight, no matter what the object's acceleration is.</p>

<p>Now why does the bathroom scale measure the magnitude of the normal
force and not the object's weight?  This will be explained on Page 5.</p>
