  <p><b>Hint</b>.  Make free-body diagrams for the two blocks.  Note
  that under the given conditions the tension in the string is
  constant all along the string.  The tension is equal to the
  magnitudes of the forces exerted by the string on the two blocks.</p>

  <p>Set up your axes, and then write down the Newton's-Second-Law
  equations as applied to the two blocks.  You only need to consider
  the components in the directions of motion of the two blocks.  You
  should obtain two equations for the tension and the magnitude of the
  acceleration of the blocks.  Solve these equations for the
  tension.</p>
