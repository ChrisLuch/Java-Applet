  <p>Yes, <i>T</i> = <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>.</p>

  <p><b>Explanation</b></p>

  <p>The free-body diagrams for the two blocks in the diagram above
  correspond to the situation in which the blocks are moving.</p>

  <p>Have a look at Tension under Get Information.  There it will be
  explained that the tension in a string is equal to the magnitude of
  the force that the string is exerting on whatever it is attached to.
  Thus the tension in the string to the left of the pulley is equal to
  <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>, the force applied by the string to block 1.
  Similarly, the tension in the string below the pulley is equal to
  <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>, the force applied by the string to block 2.</p>

  <p>The tension in a string running over a frictionless and massless
  pulley is the same on both sides of the pulley, and the tension in
  the string is the same everywhere else in the string since the
  string is massless.  Thus the tension in the string is a constant.
  Let's call it <i>T</i>.  Combining all this we get the result
  that</p>

  <p align="center"><i>T</i> = <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>.</P>
