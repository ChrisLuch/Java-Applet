  <div class="title">String Tension in Fletcher's Trolley</div>

  <p align="center"><img src="fletcherbare.jpg"></p>

  <p>The apparatus shown above is known as Fletcher's Trolley.  The
  apparatus is assumed to be without dissipative friction, and it is
  assumed that the string connecting the two blocks cannot stretch.
  The pulley and the string are assumed to be massless.  </p>


  <p>While the blocks are moving, the magnitude of the force applied
  by the string on block 1, which is equal to the tension in the
  string, is

  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (a) less than the weight of block 2</p>

  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (b) equal to the weight of block 2</p>

  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (c) greater than the weight of block 2</p>
