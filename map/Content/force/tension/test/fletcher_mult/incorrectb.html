  <p>No, the magnitude of the force exerted by the string on block 1
  is not equal to the weight of block 2.  The reason is as
  follows.</p>

  <p>One important thing to know is that the tension <i>T</i> in the
  string is the same on both sides of the pulley, since the pulley is
  massless and frictionless. This tension is equal to the magnitudes
  <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> of the forces exerted
  by the string on blocks 1 and 2, respectively.  Thus, <i>T</i> =
  <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>.</P>

  <p>Now, if <i>T</i> were equal to the weight <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> of
  block 2, the net force on this block would be zero and, by Newton's
  second law, block 2 would not accelerate.  However, when the blocks
  are moving, they are accelerating.  Thus, the string tension
  <i>T</i>, and the magnitude of the force exerted by the string on
  block 1, cannot be equal to <i>W<sub>2</sub></i>.</p>
