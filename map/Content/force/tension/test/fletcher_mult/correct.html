  <p>Yes, the magnitude <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> of the force exerted by
  the string on block 1 is less than the weight <i>W<sub>2</sub></i>
  of block 2.</p>

  <p><b>Explanation</b></p>

  <p>Have a look at the free-body diagrams for the two blocks in the diagram above.  

  <p>One important thing to know is that the tension <i>T</i> in the
  string is the same on both sides of the pulley, since the pulley is
  massless and frictionless. This tension is equal to the magnitudes
  <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> of the forces exerted
  by the string on blocks 1 and 2, respectively.  Thus, <i>T</i> =
  <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>.</P>

  <p>Now, block 2 is accelerating <b>downward</b>.  Therefore, by
  Newton's second law, the net force acting on block 2 is downward
  also.  Thus, <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> must be less than the weight
  <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> of block 2, as shown in the free-body diagram
  for block 2, and thus <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> must be less than
  <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> also.</p>
