  <p>No, the magnitude of the force exerted by the string on block 1
  is not greater than the weight of block 2. </p>

  <p>One important thing to know is that the tension <i>T</i> in the
  string is the same on both sides of the pulley, since the pulley is
  massless and frictionless. This tension is equal to the magnitudes
  <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> of the forces exerted
  by the string on blocks 1 and 2, respectively.  Thus, <i>T</i> =
  <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>T<sub>2</sub></i>.</P>

  <p>Now, if <i>T</i> were greater than the weight
  <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> of block 2, the net force on this block would
  be directed <b>upward </b>and, by Newton's second law, block 2 would
  be accelerating <b>upward</b>.  That is not what is happening.</p>
