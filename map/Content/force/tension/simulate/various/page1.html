        <center><h2>Tension Simulations</h2></center>

        <p><b>Preparation</b>:  Force/Tension/Explain It.

        <p>On the next page you can access the five simulations from the session named above.

        <ul>

            <li><u>Vertical Rope</u>.  Tension at different points in a massless
            rope.  The rope is suspended from a ceiling and holds up a crate of
            variable mass.</li>

            <li><u>Vertical Massive Rope</u>.  Tension at different points in a
            massive rope suspended from a ceiling.  The mass of the rope can be
            varied.</li>

            <li><u>Tug of War</u>.  Tension at different points in a horizontal
            stationary rope that has several forces applied to it at either
            end.</li>

            <li><u>Horizontal Rope</u>.  Tension at different points in a
            horizontal stationary rope.  The rope has a single force applied to it
            at either end whose magnitude can be varied.</li>

            <li><u>Train Demo</u>.  The tensions in the strings connecting three
            blocks pulled on a horizontal surface by an applied force.  The system
            can have friction.  The applied force, the masses of the blocks, and
            the friction coefficients can be varied.</li>

        </ul>
