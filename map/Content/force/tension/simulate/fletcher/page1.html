    <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the forces in Fletcher's Trolley including
    string tension.

    <p>Fletcher's Trolley is a system of two blocks, one of them moving
    horizontally and one of them vertically.  The blocks are connected
    by a string that is guided over a pulley.  The applet lets you vary
    the masses of the blocks and of the pulley.

    <p>Instructions on how to run the applet and lessons on string
    tension are available under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.

    <p>See Activities under Related Items for some suggestions of
    exercises related to string tension that can be carried out with the
    applet.
