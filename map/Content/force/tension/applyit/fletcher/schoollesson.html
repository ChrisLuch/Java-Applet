<ol>

<li>Click the Reset button <img src="lessonimages/reset.gif">.

<p>The lower edge of block 2 will then be at elevation <i>h</i> = ,
and the yellow platform at <i>h</i> = 0, as in the snapshot below.

<p>The masses of blocks 1 and 2 will be <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> = 600 g
and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> = 400 g, respectively, and the pulley's mass
will be 0.  These mass values will be assumed in all of the following,
except where otherwise noted.

<p align="center"><img src="lessonimages/fletcherresized.jpg"></p></li>

  <p>

<li><b>Physical assumptions underlying the applet:</b>

  <p>

  <ul>

  <li>Block 1 slides on the table without friction, and there is no
  friction in the pulley's bearings.  There <b>is</b> friction between
  the string and the pulley, causing the pulley to rotate when the
  string is moving, but this friction is not dissipative because the
  string is not slipping over the pulley.  This means that this
  friction does not cause a loss in mechanical energy of the system
  and has no effect on the system's motion other than making the
  pulley a dynamical partner of the system.</li>

  <li>The string is inextensible.  This means that the string does not
  stretch like a rubber band, so that there won't be any oscillations
  in the system when it is in motion.  The two blocks will be moving
  in unison with the same speed at any given instant.</li>

  <li>The string is massless.  If the string had non-zero mass, the
  tension in the string would vary along the string, because of
  inertial effects of the string when the string is moving and because
  of gravitational effects in the vertical part of the string. If the
  string is massless, the tensions in the two ends of string on either
  side of the pulley are constant along these two ends.  (However, the
  tensions in the two ends on either side of the pulley will not be
  equal to each other if the pulley has mass and the system is moving,
  even if the string is massless.  See below.)</li>

  <li>The magnitude <i>g</i> of the acceleration due to gravity is
  taken to be 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</li>

  </ul>

<p>

<li>Click on block 1 and drag it until block 2 is at elevation
<i>h</i> = 3.00 m.

<p>If your window size is small, you may have to drag block 1 beyond
the left edge of the window.  As long as you don't release the mouse
button while doing this, you can keep on dragging the block.
Alternatively, you can resize the window by dragging its lower
right-hand corner.</li>

<p>

<li>You may want to just observe the motion of the blocks without
taking notes.  If so, click Play <img src="lessonimages/start.gif">.
Observe the motion until the motion is automatically paused when block
2 reaches <i>h</i> = 0.  (See ShowMe - Fletcher's Trolley for details
on what happens to the platform before the block reaches this point.)
Then click Replay <img src="lessonimages/replay.gif">.

<p>

<li>Step <img src="lessonimages/step.gif"> through the motion until
block 2 reaches <i>h</i> = 0 and note down the values of the speed and
the time at each instant.  E.g., at <i>t</i> = 0.20 s, <i>v</i> = 0.8
m/s.

<p>It is useful to make a table of the data and a graph of <i>v</i>
vs. <i>t</i>.  The graph should yield a straight line, within
experimental uncertainties, if the acceleration is constant.</p>

<p>An Appendix at the end of this Lesson lists standard kinematical
equations for motions with constant acceleration.  The directions of
the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes chosen in the applet coincide with the
directions of motion and the directions of the accelerations of the
blocks.  Therefore the blocks' velocities and accelerations will all
be be positive (or zero) and therefore numerically equal to the
corresponding speeds and magnitudes of acceleration, i.e.,

     <p align="center">|<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>| = <i>v</i> &nbsp&nbsp
     and &nbsp&nbsp|<i>a<sub>x</sub></i>| = <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>This means that we can use the abbreviated notations <i>v</i> and
<i>a</i> in all following equations.

<p>Using the appropriate equation from the Appendix and your <i>v</i>
vs. <i>t</i> data, determine a value for the magnitude <i>a</i> of the
acceleration.  E.g., equation (A2) from the Appendix, after setting
<i>v</i>(0) = 0, gives for <i>a</i> the expression

<p align="center"><i>a</i> = <i>v</i>(<i>t</i>)/<i>t</i>.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (1)

<p>Substituting the values from the data pair above gives

<p align="center"><i>a</i> = 0.8/0.2 = 4 m/s<sup>2</sup> .&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (2)

<p>Repeat this for several more data pairs.  If you get the same value
for <i>a</i> every time, within experimental uncertainty, this
demonstrates that the acceleration is indeed constant.  Compare your
value with that shown by the applet.</li>

<p>

<li><b>Question</b>: Why would one expect the accelerations of the
blocks in Fletcher's Trolley to be constant?

<p><b>Answer</b>: The force of gravity acting on block 2, which drives
the system, is constant.  Newton's second law of motion says that the
net force acting on an object is proportional to the object's
acceleration.  Thus, if the forces acting on an object are constant,
then the same must be true for the acceleration of the object.

</ol>

<a name="AccelerationCalc"><p><h3>Acceleration Calculated from the
Masses of the Blocks</h3></p></a>

<p>An engineer who wants to design a system so that it has a certain
acceleration must be able to calculate the acceleration from the
parameters defining the system.  In the case of Fletcher's Trolley,
these parameters are the masses of the two blocks and the magnitude
<i>g</i> of the acceleration due to gravity.  (The pulley is assumed
here to have zero mass.)

<p><b>Question</b>: Given the masses <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> = 0.600 kg
and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> = 0.400 kg, and <i>g</i> = 9.8
m/s<sup>2</sup>, how can one calculate the magnitude <i>a</i> of the
acceleration of the two blocks?

<p><b>Answer</b>.  

<ul>

  <li><u>Overview</u>.  Applying Newton's second law to the two blocks
separately will give two equations for two unknowns: <i>a</i> and the
string tension <i>T</i>.  (Both blocks have accelerations of the same
magnitude <i>a</i> because the string is assumed not to stretch.)
Note that for a massless and frictionless pulley and a massless
string, the tension <i>T</i> in the string is the same on both sides
of the pulley and everywhere along the sring and equal to the
magnitudes <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> of the forces
exerted by the string on blocks 1 and 2, respectively: 

<p align="center"><i>T</i> = <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> =
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i>.</p>

<p>The two equations for <i>a</i> and <i>T</i> can be solved.</li>

<p>

  <li><u>Setting Up the Basic Equations</u>.  The coordinate axes are
defined in the applet: <i>x</i> horizontal and to the right, <i>y</i>
vertical and downward.  The free-body diagrams for the two blocks are
shown by the applet as well, if you click the free-body diagram button
<img src="lessonimages/fbd.gif">.  Applying Newton's second law to the
two blocks separately yields the following two equations.  These are
the two fundamental equations governing the motion of the system.

 <p align="center">block 1 (<i>x</i>-direction):
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<i>T</i> = 0.6<i>a</i> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
 (3)</p>

 <p align="center">block 2 (<i>y</i>-direction): &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 0.4<i>g</i>
 - <i>T</i> = 0.4<i>a</i>. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(4)</li>

 <p>You may want to verify that the values <i>a</i> = 3.92
 m/s<sup>2</sup> and <i>T</i> = 2.4 N displayed by the applet satisfy
 these equations, to within significant figures.</li>

<p>

  <li><u>Solving the Equations</u>. Adding the left-hand sides and the
  right-hand sides of equations (3) and (4) causes <i>T</i> to drop
  out and leads to the following equation for <i>a</i>:

  <p align="center">0.4<i>g</i> = 0.6<i>a</i> + 0.4<i>a</i> =
  1.0<i>a</i></p>

  whence

  <p align="center"><i>a</i> = 0.4x9.8 = 3.92 m/s<sup>2</sup>,
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (5)</p>

  <p>to significant figures consistent with the data.</p>

  <p>This is the value displayed by the applet.</p>

<a name="Easy"><p><h3>The Easy Way to Calculate the Acceleration</h3></p></a>

<p><ol>

<li><u>Introduction of a System Dynamically Equivalent to Fletcher's
Trolley</u>

<p>Let us consider a system that looks somewhat different from
Fletcher's Trolley, the system shown in the diagram below, together
with the free-body diagrams for the two blocks.

<p align="center"><img src="lessonimages/fletcherlinear.jpg"></p>
  
<p>The system consists of two blocks with the same masses as in
Fletcher's Trolley, 600 g and 400 g.  The blocks are connected by a
massless, inextensible string and can slide without friction on a
horizontal table.  A force of magnitude 3.92 N is acting on block 2 to
the right.  This force has the same magnitude as the force of gravity
that is acting on block 2 in the downward direction in Fletcher's
Trolley.</p>

<p>This horizontal system is dynamically equivalent to Fletcher's
Trolley, because Newton's second law applied to the two blocks leads
to the same equations for both systems, namely, equations (3) and (4)
above.  This becomes clear when you consider the free-body diagrams
for the horizontal system and compare them to those for Fletcher's
Trolley.  Both sets of free-body diagrams look alike, except that the
diagram for block 2 in the horizontal system is turned by
90<sup>0</sup> relative to that in Fletcher's Trolley.  Again, the
magnitudes of the forces applied by the string to either block 1 or
block 2 are equal to the tension <i>T</i> in the string.</p>

<p>The same free-body diagrams with the same masses and forces imply
the same equations from Newton's second law.  If both systems are
governed by the same equations for <i>a</i> and <i>T</i>, the
resulting values for <i>a</i> and <i>T</i> will be the same as well.
Thus, the two systems are dynamically equivalent.  All the pulley does
is to change the direction of the string and the direction of motion
of block 2.</p>

<p>So, is there an advantage in considering the horizontal system in
place of Fletcher's Trolley?  <b>Yes</b>, because it is easier to find
the acceleration for the horizontal system.  For the horizontal
system, there is another way to find the acceleration than solving
equations (3) and (4).  Here is what you can do.</li>

<p><li><u>Setting up the Basic Equation</u>. Since the string does not
stretch, both blocks and the string move in unison like a rigid
body. By Newton's second law of motion, the net external force acting
on a rigid body is equal to the body's mass times its acceleration.
Thus,

<p align="center">3.92 N = (0.600 kg + 0.400 kg) <i>a</i> = 1.00 x
<i>a</i>. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(6)</p></li>

<p><li><u>Solving the Equation</u>.  This step is trivial:

<p align="center"><i>a</i> = 3.92 m/s<sup>2</sup>
. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(7)</p>

<p>This is the same value that was found earlier, result (5), and that
is displayed by the applet.</li>

<p><li><u>Comment</u>.  When a body is rigid, the only forces that
need to be considered in finding the body's acceleration are the
<b>external</b> forces.  The internal forces, in the horizontal system
the forces exerted by the string on the two blocks, can be ignored.
(In Fletcher's Trolley, the system is not a rigid body because the two
blocks are moving in different directions.  Thus, we need to consider
the forces acting on each block separately.)</li>

</ol>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><a href="#Top">Back to the
Top</a></font></p>

<a name="Tension"><p><h3>Tension in the String</h3></a>

<p><b>Question</b>: How can one calculate the tension present in the
string when the blocks are moving?

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The tension is not measured as easily as the
acceleration.  One would have to insert a strain gauge into the
string, which would not be massless and would have an effect on the
conditions in the system including the tension.  Thus, it is
particularly important that one knows how to calculate the tension.
E.g., an engineer who has to design a system like Fletcher's Trolley
will want to know how strong to make the string so that it will not
break under the tension that it has to sustain.

<p>If one already has a value for the acceleration, the easiest way to
find the tension is to substitute value (7) for <i>a</i> in equation
(3).  This immediately gives the value

<p align="center"><i>T</i> = 0.600x3.92 = 2.35 N
. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(8)</p>

<p>The applet displays a value of 2.4 N, which is consistent with
this.

<p>You should verify that equation (4) too is satisfied by the pair of
values (7) and (8).

<p>Note that the tension value of 2.35 N is <b>less</b> than the
weight of block 2.  The latter is equal to <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> =
<i>m<sub>2</sub>g</i> = 0.400x9.8 = 3.92 N.

<p align="center"><font size="1"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></font></p>

<a name="Symbols"><p><h3>Working with Symbols</h3></a>

<p>Suppose you have to find the acceleration and tension for a
different set of masses.  You would have to do the same calculations
all over again if you have worked things out only with numbers until
now.  If, instead of working with numbers you work with the symbols
<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> and derive general
expressions for <i>a</i> and <i>T</i> that are expressed in terms of
these symbols, then all you need to do to find values for <i>a</i> and
<i>T</i> is substitute the masses of the blocks into these general
expressions.  You don't need to solve the same equations all over
again, every time you are dealing with a different pair of mass
values.

<p><b>Exercise</b>.  Try to obtain general expressions for <i>a</i>
and <i>T</i> in terms of <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>
by generalizing equations (3) and (4) so that the numerical mass
values are replaced by the symbols <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and
<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>, and then solving these equations for <i>a</i>
and <i>T</i>.

<p><b>Solution</b>.  

<p><u>Newton 2 applied to block 1, x-direction only, when the blocks
are in motion</u>:

<p align="center"><i>T<sub>1</sub></i> =
<i>m<sub>1</sub>a</i>. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(9)</p>

<p><u>Newton 2 applied to block 2, y-direction only, when the blocks
are in motion</u>:

<p align="center"><i>W<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> =
<i>m<sub>2</sub>a</i>. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(10)

<p>Equations (9) and (10) are the generalizations in terms of symbols
of equations (3) and (4).

<p>Now let us solve equations (9) and (10).</p>

<p>When we add the two left-hand sides and the two right-hand sides,
the tension cancels and we get an equation that involves only the
unknown <i>a</i>,</p>

<p align="center"><i>W<sub>2</sub></i> = (<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> +
<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>)<i>a</i>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (11)</p>

whence

<p align="center"><i>a</i> =
<i>W<sub>2</sub></i>/(<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>)

= [<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>/(<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>)]
<i>g</i> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (12)</p>

<p>where <i>W<sub>2</sub></i> = <i>m<sub>2</sub>g</i> has been used.</p>

<p>Equation (12) gives us an expression for <i>a</i> into which we
merely need to substitute the mass values to find the corresponding
value for <i>a</i>. If we do this for <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> = 0.600 kg
and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> = 0.400 kg, we get

<p align="center"><i>a</i> = [0.4/(0.6 + 0.4)] x 9.8 = 3.92 m
s<sup>-2</sup>. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (13)</p>

<p>This is again value (7) for <i>a</i> found earlier and the value
given by the applet.

<p>To get the general expression for the tension <i>T</i>, we substite
expression (12) in equation (9).  This gives</p>

<p align = "center"><i>T</i> =
[<i>m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub></i>/(<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> +
<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>)] <i>g</i>, &nbsp&nbsp when blocks are
moving. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(14)</p>

<p>Substituting the present mass values into equation (14), gives for
the tension when the blocks are in motion</p>

<p align="center"><i>T</i> = [0.6x0.4/(0.6 + 0.4)] x 9.8 = 2.35
N. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(15)</p>

<p><b>Comments</b>.  The general expressions (12) and (14) for
<i>a</i> and <i>T</i> have other advantages besides saving you the
hassle of having to solve the basic equations every time all over
again.  Here are some of these.

<p>

<ul>

<li>One can check the dimensions of expressions (12) and (14).  If
they are correct, then this reassures us that the answers are correct.
In expression (12), the ratio of masses is dimensionless.  That leaves
us with <i>g</i> on the right-hand side which has the dimension of
acceleration, as does the left-hand side.  Thus, the equation is
correct dimensionally.  One cannot carry out such a check if one works
with numbers.

<p>In expression (14), the numerator of the fraction is the square of
a mass and the denominator a mass.  Thus, the ratio of the two is a
mass.  Multiplied by g, which has the units of acceleration, gives a
force because mass times acceleration is a force.  Thus, the
right-hand side has the dimensions of force, which is as it should be
because tension has the dimensions of force as well.</li>

<p>

<li> One can test expression (14) for the tension by checking whether
it gives the right answer in an extreme case where one knows
intuitively what the tension should be.  E.g., take
<i>m<sub>2</sub></i> = 0. In this case, one would expect the tension
<i>T</i> to be zero as well.  Expression (14) does give this
answer.

<p>This is the same as value (8) found earlier.</li>

</ul>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><a href="#Top">Back to the Top</a></font></p>

<a name="Conditions"><p><h3>Conditions Affecting the Tension</h3></a>

<p>
<ol>

<li><b>Question</b>. Expression (14) gives the tension in the string
when the blocks are moving.  Obviously, the value of the tension
depends on the masses of the blocks.  What other conditions could be
varied that might affect the tension?

<p>Does expression (14) still apply when block 1 is held fixed and the
system is at rest?  In other words, does the tension have the same
value no matter whether the blocks are moving or are at rest?  Or is
the tension perhaps larger when the blocks are accelerating?

<p><b>Answer</b>.  Look at the free-body diagrams in the snapshot
below showing the system when block 1 is held fixed.

<p align="center"><img src="lessonimages/fletcherresized.jpg"></p>

<p>The free-body diagram for block 2 shows the same two forces acting
on the block now as when the block is moving: the upward force of
magnitude <i>T</i> exerted by the string and the downward force of
gravity of magnitude <i>W<sub>2</sub></i>.  However, this qualitative
similarity does not mean that <i>T</i> has the same value in both
cases.

<p>Based on the free-body diagram for block 2, Newton's second law
implies equation of motion (10) for the block, already considered
earlier:

<p align="center"><i>W<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> =
<i>m<sub>2</sub>a</i>. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(10)

<p>When the blocks are in motion, <i>a</i> > 0 so that the right-hand
side is positive.  This implies that the tension is smaller than the
weight when the blocks are moving.  However, when the blocks are at
rest, <i>a</i> = 0.  With that, equation (10) implies that the tension
is <b>equal</b> to the weight.  Thus, the tension is <b>less</b> when
the blocks are accelerating than when they are at rest with block 2
hanging freely.</li>

<p>

<li><b>Question</b>.  So far, we have always assumed the pulley's mass
to be zero.  Does the tension in the string change when the pulley's
mass is changed?

<p><b>Experiment</b>.  Reset the applet.  Then use the pulley slider to
set the pulley's moment of inertia, <i>I</i>, equal to 0.125 kg
m<sup>2</sup>.  The pulley's mass will then be equal to 1.00 kg.

<p align="center"><img src="lessonimages/pulleyslider.jpg"></p>

<ul>

<p><li>Observe the tension while the blocks are still at rest. The
pulley will then be at rest as well so that its inertial properties
will not matter.  Thus, the tension is the same, whether the pulley
has mass or not.  It is still equal to 3.9 N.</li>

<p><li>Now click Play and then Pause the motion at some point.  Note
the values of <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> displayed
by the applet.  You should find <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> = 1.6 N and
<i>T<sub>2</sub></i> = 2.9 N.  Thus, the tensions are not equal on the
two sides of the pulley, and neither value is equal to the 2.4 N
observed when the pulley's mass is zero.

<p>The tensions must be different on the two sides of the pulley so
that the string can apply a net torque on the pulley that will
accelerate the pulley's clockwise rotation.  This net torque must be
unequal to zero when the pulley has inertia.  A detailed derivation of
the two tension values is not part of the Physics 20 curriculum.</li>

</ul>

<a name="Appendix"><p><h3>Appendix - Equations for Motions with
Constant Acceleration</h3></a>

     <p>In the equations in the table below, it is assumed that an
     object is moving along an x-axis with constant acceleration
     <i>a<sub>x</sub></i>. For a motion along a y-axis with constant
     acceleration, the equations are analogous. You would only replace
     the subscript <i>x</i> by <i>y</i>.

     <p><b>Notation</b>. Both the velocity, <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>, and
     the acceleration, <i>a<sub>x</sub></i>, will be written here with
     the subscript <i>x</i>. Quantities that carry the subscript
     <i>x</i> can be either positive or negative. The subscript
     notation distinguishes these quantities from others that can take
     on only positive values (or zero), like the speed, <i>v</i>, and
     the magnitude <i>a</i> of the acceleration. Quantities without
     subscript are equal to the absolute values of the corresponding
     quantities with subscript:

     <p align="center"> <i>v</i> = |<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>| &nbsp&nbsp
     and &nbsp&nbsp <i>a</i> = |<i>a<sub>x</sub></i>|.</p>

	  <p>The notation <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>(<i>t</i>) indicates the
	  value of the velocity <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> at time <i>t</i>.
	  Similarly, <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>) indicates the value of the position
	  <i>x</i> at time <i>t</i>.
