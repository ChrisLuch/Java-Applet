        <center><b>Tension in a Dynamic Situation</b></center>

        <p>Observe the tensions in the three ropes and the masses of the three
        blocks.  Can you detect a systematic relationship between the tensions
        and the masses?

        <p>Let us again take the masses of the three blocks, from front to back, as
        50 kg, 30 kg, and 20 kg, respectively, and the applied force as 60 N.
        
        <p>Then the tension in the last string is 12 N.  This is a fraction
        of the 60-N force applied to the system equal to 12/60 = 0.2.  This
        fraction is equal also to the ratio (mass of last block)/(total mass) =
        20/100 = 0.2.

        <p>Similarly, the tension in the middle string is 30 N which is a
        fraction of 30/60 = 0.5 of the 60-N applied force.  The combined mass
        of the two blocks pulled by the middle string is the same fraction of
        the total mass, namely, (20+30)/100 = 0.5.

        <p>Do you think the tension and mass fractions at a given point in the
        system are equal no matter what the masses of the blocks and the
        applied force are?  If so, this would provide an easy means of working
        out the tensions at different points in a system of this kind.

        <p><b>Try to prove this</b>.  To prove this in general, you will have
        to work with symbols.  When done, go on to the next page where the
        derivation will be done when there is also friction acting on the
        blocks.
