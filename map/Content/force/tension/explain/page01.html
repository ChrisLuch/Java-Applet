    <h2>Tension - What is It?</h2>

    <p class="general">You may have already used the concept of tension previously. Here 
      we will explain what tension is.</p>
    <h3 class="general">Question</h3>

    <p>Two student teams are in a &quot;tug-of-war&quot; 
      - each team pulling on one end of a rope with a 1300-N force. What is the tension 
      in the rope between the teams?

    <p>Consider the following answers.</p>

    <ol>

      <li><b>2600 N</b>; because there are two forces of 1300 N each 
        acting on the rope and 1300 N + 1300 N = 2600 N.</li>

      <li><b>0 N</b>; because there are two equal and<b> opposite</b> 
        forces of 1300 N each acting on the rope and 1300 N - 1300 N = 0 N.</li>

      <li><b>1300 N</b>; because the tension is equal to the magnitude 
        of just one of the two forces.</li>

    </ol>
