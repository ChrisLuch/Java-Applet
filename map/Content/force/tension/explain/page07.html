        <center><b>Tension - What Is It?</b></center>

        <p>In the tug-of-war situation, the tension in the length of rope
        <b>between the teams</b> is 1300 N.

        <p><b>Question</b>. What is the tension in a segment of rope
        <b>between two team members</b>, say, between the first and second
        team member on the right?  Is it 1300 N there as well?

        <p>The simulation lets you explore this kind of situation.  Shown is a
        rope that has three forces acting on it near its left end and three
        forces near its right end.  The points at which the forces are applied
        to the ropes are at the dots at the tail ends of the arrows.  You can
        drag the pointer along the rope, and it will indicate the tension in
        the rope at that point.

        <p>Can you calculate the tensions indicated by the pointer?  <b>Try to
        work out</b> some of them and then go on to the next page to compare.
