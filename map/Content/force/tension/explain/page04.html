        <center><b>Tension - What Is It?</b></center>

        <p>The tension at a given point in a rope is equal to the
        <b>magnitude</b> of the force that one portion of the rope exerts on
        the other portion at this point.  The more tension there is, the
        harder the two portions are pulling on each other.

        <p><b>Question</b>: Is tension a vector or a scalar quantity?

        <p><b>Answer</b>: Tension is defined as the <b>magnitude</b> of a
        force.  Magnitudes are scalars.  Thus, tension is a scalar also.
        Tension does <b>not</b> have direction.  What does have direction is
        the force that one portion of a rope exerts on the adjoining portion.
        Tension is only the <b>magnitude</b> of this force.

        <p>Did you explore what the tension is at different points in the
        rope, by 'cutting' the rope in different places?  In the present
        situation, the tension has the same value everywhere, equal to the
        weight of the crate.  Can you explain why?
