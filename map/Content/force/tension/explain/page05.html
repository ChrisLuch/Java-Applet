        <b><center>Tension - What Is It?</center></b>

        <p>The weight of the crate is set to 300 N.  If you 'cut' the rope
        where it connects to the ceiling and where it is attached to the
        crate, you will see that there is an upward 300-N force exerted on the
        rope by the ceiling and a downward 300-N force exerted on the rope by
        the crate.  It is these two forces, applied to the rope at either end,
        that create the tension in the rope.

        <p>The subsidiary diagram shows the entire rope by itself with the two
        external forces acting on the rope at its ends.

        <p>Let us now return to the horizontal situation, which, if one
        considers only the rope, is basically the same as the vertical
        situation except turned by 90 degrees.
