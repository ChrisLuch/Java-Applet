    <b><center>Tension - What Is It?</center></b>

    <p>The horizontal case shown here corresponds to the tug-of-war situation
      from Page 1. There, we had a rope that had a 1300-N force applied at
      its left end pulling to the left and another 1300-N force at the
      right end pulling to the right.  Here, the common magnitude of these
      forces can be adjusted by the slider.  Again, 'cut' the rope at
      various points along its length.

    <p>What do you conclude about the forces exerted at any point along
      the rope by one piece of rope on the other?  And about their
      magnitudes, the tension?

    <p>So - the tension is the same everywhere along the rope, and it is
      equal to the magnitude of <b>one</b> of the external forces applied
      to the rope at its ends.  If there is a 300-N force applied to the
      rope at the left end and an opposite 300-N force applied to the rope
      at the right end, the tension in the rope is <b>300 N</b>.

    <p><b>In the tug-of-war example from Page 1, the tension in the rope
      between the teams is 1300 N.</b>
