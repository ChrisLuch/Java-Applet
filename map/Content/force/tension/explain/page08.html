        <p align="center"><b>Tension - What Is It?</b>

        <p>The subsidiary diagram introduces the following notation.  The
        points where forces <i>F<sub>4</sub></i> and <i>F<sub>5</sub></i> are
        acting are labeled I and II, respectively.  We wish to find the
        tension at point P, somewhere between points I and II.  The segment of
        rope that extends from point P to the right end of the rope is labeled
        segment A.  Its outline is drawn with a continuous line.  To find the
        tension at P, we need to know the force exerted on segment A at point
        P by the main portion of the rope, to the left of point P.  This
        portion is denoted segment B and drawn with a stippled outline.

        <p>Only the forces acting on segment A are shown.  They are the two
        external forces labeled <i>F<sub>5</sub></i> and <i>F<sub>6</sub></i>
        and the internal force, labeled <i>F<sub>int</sub></i>, which is the
        force exerted on segment A by segment B at point P.  (Force
        <i>F<sub>4</sub></i> is acting on segment B, not A.)

        <p>As the simulation indicates, the tension at point P is 900 N.  To
        find the tension in this segment, we need to apply <b>Newton's second
        law</b> to segment A.  The reasoning is like that on Page 3.

        <p>Since segment A is at rest and therefore has zero acceleration, the
        net force acting on this segment must equal zero, by Newton's second
        law.  Since <i>F<sub>5</sub></i> + <i>F<sub>6</sub></i> = 600 + 300 =
        900 N, <i>F<sub>int</sub></i> must have a magnitude of 900 N, to
        balance the other two forces.  By definition of tension, the tension
        at P is equal to <i>F<sub>int</sub></i> and therefore equal to 900 N.

        <p>Practice this kind of reasoning by deriving the tensions in the
        other segments of the rope.
