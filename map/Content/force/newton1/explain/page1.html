  <p>Newton's <b>First Law of Motion</b>:</p>

  <blockquote>Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or
  of moving uniformly straight forward, except in so far as it is
  compelled to change its state by forces impressed.</blockquote>

  <p>(Translated from the original Latin by I.E. Cohen and
  A. Whitman.)</p>

  <p>
    In trying to understand the significance of this law, at least two
    questions need to be asked.
  </p>

  <p>
    1. Is this law not just a special case of Newton's second law of
    motion:
  </p>
  <blockquote>The sum of all forces <img src="F.gif"
  align="bottom"><sub>1</sub>, <img src="F.gif"
  align="bottom"><sub>2</sub>, ... acting on a particle is equal to
  the product of the particle's mass <i>m</i> and the particle's
  acceleration <img src="a.gif" align="bottom">,
  <br><br>
  <center><img src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> +
  <img src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> + ... = <i>m</i> <img
  src="a.gif" align="bottom"> ?</center>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The second law implies that the acceleration of a particle is zero
    if no forces are acting on the particle; and for a particle's
    acceleration to be zero, the particle must either be at rest or
    moving with contstant speed in a straight line.  Thus, Newton's
    second law does reduce to his first law when there are no forces
    acting on the particle.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. What does it mean to say that a body is "at rest"?  Does being
    at rest not depend on the frame of reference relative to which the
    body's motion is measured?  E.g., a passenger in an accelerating
    car is at rest relative to the car, but he is in accelerated motion
    relative to the ground over which the car travels.  Does Newton's
    first law hold equally well in the car frame of reference and in
    the ground frame of reference?
  </p>
  <p>
	 The answer is that Newton's first law holds in the ground frame of
    reference, but not in the car frame of reference.  The passenger
    in the accelerating car experiences a force pushing him forward
    even though he is "at rest" relative to the car.  Newton's first
    law does not hold in the car frame of reference because there is a
    force acting on the passenger and yet the passenger remains at
    rest relative to this frame.
  </p>
  <p>
    This example illustrates that there is a difference between
    different kinds of reference frames, called <i>inertial</i> and
    <i>non-inertial</i> frames. Newton's first law and Newton's second
    law are valid in <b>inertial</b> frames of reference, but they are
    not true in <b>non</b>-inertial frames of reference.
  </p>
  <p>
	 How does one define inertial frames of reference?  The definition
    is based on Newton's first law.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    An inertial frame of reference is a reference frame relative to
    which Newton's first law of motion is true.  
  </blockquote>
  <p> To test whether a reference frame is inertial, take an object
    that has no forces acting on it and make sure that the object is
    at rest relative to this frame at one moment.  If the object
    remains at rest relative to this frame, the frame is inertial.  In
    contrast, if an object stays at rest relative to some reference
    frame while there is a net force acting on the object, then this
    reference frame is non-inertial.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through the definition of inertial frames, Newton's first law of
    motion acquires a new significance.  When Newton's first law is
    taken to define inertial frames, it does not play the role of a
    special case of Newton's second law, but defines the circumstances
    under which Newton's second law applies.  Newton's second law is
    not true in non-inertial frames. It is true only in inertial
    frames.
  </p>
  <p>
    Newton's first law is also called the "Law of Inertia".  For more
