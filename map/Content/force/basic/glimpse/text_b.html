        <p>
        The green bar at the bottom of the applet window is supposed to
        represent the surface of the earth.  When you PLAY the motion, the
        red particle performs a parabolic motion.
        </p>

        <p>
        This kind of motion is called <i>projectile motion</i>.  If you throw
        a ball into the air, it will perform approximately the kind of motion
        simulated here.  (Not exactly, because a real ball experiences air
        resistance while the red particle in the applet does not.)
        </p>

        <p>
        In the applet, the red particle is <b>interacting gravitationally</b>
        with the entire earth.  If the earth were not there, the red
        particle's motion would be quite different.
