      Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.

      <p>
      In each of the four applet panels on the left, a particle is
      displayed (red object).  In each panel except one, the particle is
      interacting with one or more other objects.  The other object(s)
      is(are) not shown.  
      </p>
      <p>
      For each panel, try to guess from the particle's motion if the
      particle is interacting and, if so, what the other object(s) might be
      with which the particle is interacting.  Click the PLAY button for a
      panel to observe the motion.

      For an explanation of the situation realized in each panel, select
      the corresponding radio button below and click the GO button.

      <p>
      <u>Terminology</u>. If another object is interacting with a particle,
      that object exerts a <i>force</i> on the particle.  </p
      <p>
      <b>Important Lesson</b>.  In order for a force to be exerted on a
      particle, there always must be another object exerting this force.  A
      force cannot just exist by itself.
