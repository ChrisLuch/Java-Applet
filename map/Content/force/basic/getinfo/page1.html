      Force
    </div>
    <p>
      In Newtonian mechanics, <i>force</i> is a manifestation of the
      interaction between two objects.
     </p>
	 <p>
      One distinguishes between different kinds of forces depending on
      the nature of the interaction.  The mathematical expressions
      representing different kinds of forces are different.
	 </p> 
	 <p>
      In macrosopic physics, as opposed to elementary particle
      physics, one distinguishes the following kinds of forces:
    </p>
	 <ol>
      <li>
       Two <i>fundamental</i> forces: <i>gravitational</i> and
       <i>electromagnetic</i>.  These are long-range forces, which
       means that objects can interact via these forces when the
       objects are macrosopic distances away from each other, maybe a
       few centimeters or many thousands of kilometers.<br><br>
      </li>
		<li>
       <i>Contact</i> forces.  These act only when the two interacting
       objects are in contact with each other.  Examples are
       <i>friction</i> forces, whose direction always lies in the
       surface of contact, and <i>normal</i> forces, whose direction
       is perpendicular to the surface of contact.  (The "normal", in
       mathematics, is the line perpendicular to a surface.)<br><br>

		 Contact forces arise from the electromagnetic interaction
		 between atoms and molecules in the contacting surface layers of
		 the two objects.  Although electromagnetic in origin, these
		 forces are not long-range when the objects in contact carry
		 zero net electric charge.
     </li>
    </ol>
	 <p>
      <b>Terminology</b>.  An object <b>has</b> momentum and
      <b>has</b> kinetic energy, but it does <b>not have</b> force.
      Instead, one says that a force "is exerted on an object".  This
      terminology suggests that there is another object involved that
      exerts the force.  The complete expression is to say that a
      force "is exerted <b>on</b> object A <b>by</b> object B".  This
      way of talking about force makes it clear what force one is
      talking about.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Quantitative Definition</b>.  Force is a vector quantity.
      Assuming there is only one force <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
      align="bottom"> exerted on a given object A, i.e., object A is
      interacting with only one other object B, then this force is
      defined to be numerically equal to the product of mass <i>m</i>
      and acceleration <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom">
      of object A,
	 </p>
	 <p align="center">
      <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"> = <i>m</i><img
      src="a.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom">.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      The symbol <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"> in
      this equation stands for a mathematical expression, the <i>force
      expression</i>, that charaterizes the particular force involved.
      If the force exerted on object A is a fundamental force, the
      force expression involves parameters relating to object A and
      the other object B that is interacting with object A.  E.g., if
      we are dealing with the gravitational force, the force
      expression is known as <i>Newton's law of gravitation</i> and
      involves the masses of objects A and B and the displacement
      vector from one object to the other.  In the case of a contact
      force, e.g., the force applied to object A by a rope attached to
      this object, the force expression may be simply a specific
      vector whose magnitude has been determined empirically and whose
      direction is known also.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      Note that the product <i>m</i><img src="a.gif" alt="vector a"
      align="bottom"> is not considered to be a force.  This product
      is what the force expression <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
      align="bottom"> is equal to.  
    </p>
	 <p>
		If more than one force is acting on object A, i.e., object A is
      interacting with more than one other object, the product
      <i>m</i><img src="a.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom"> is equal
      to the vector sum of the corresponding force expressions.  This
      sum is called the <i>net force</i>. The statement that the net
      force acting on an object is equal to the product of mass and
      acceleration of the object is known as <i>Newton's second law of
      motion</i>.
	 </p>
    <p>
      The SI-unit of force is the newton (N).
