  <p><blockquote>The sum of all forces <img src="F.gif"
  align="bottom"><sub>1</sub>, <img src="F.gif"
  align="bottom"><sub>2</sub>, ... acting on a particle is equal to
  the product of the particle's mass <i>m</i> and the particle's
  acceleration <img src="a.gif" align="bottom">,

  <p align="center"><img src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> +
  <img src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> + ... = <i>m</i> <img

  <p><u>Comment 1</u>.  If the forces on the left-hand side of this
  equation are all <b>real</b> forces, then this equation is true only
  in an inertial frame, any inertial frame.  In this Lesson, we will
  use the Laboratory Frame throughout which the applet takes to be an
  inertial frame.  <i>Real forces</i> are forces resulting from the
  interaction between two objects.

  <p><u>Comment 2</u>.  "Particle" means a "point particle" of
  negligible extension.  This law also applies to an extended object
  if the object is rigid and not rotating.  Then all parts of the
  object have the same acceleration, and Equation (1) is true with
  this acceleration.  It does not matter <b>where</b> the forces are
  acting on the object.

  <p><u>Comment 3</u>.  The sum of all forces acting on a particle or
  extended object is referred to as the <i>net force</i> or the
  <i>total force</i> acting on the particle or object.  The net force
  is the <b>vector</b> sum of the individual forces.
