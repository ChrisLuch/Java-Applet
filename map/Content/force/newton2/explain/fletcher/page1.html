<ul>

<li>Force/Newton's Second Law/Explain It/Single Block.</li>

<li>Force/Tension/Explain It/Pulley Theorem.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Question</b>.  The Fletcher's Trolley apparatus simulated on the
left is frictionless.  The string connecting the block is massless and
inextensible.  The pulley is massless.  When block 1 is released, what
will be the acceleration of the blocks if the mass of block 1 is 0.6
kg and the mass of block 2 is 0.4 kg?</p>

<p>Try to work out the answer.  Then run the simulation and check your
answer.  Both the acceleration and the tension will be worked on the
following pages.</p>
