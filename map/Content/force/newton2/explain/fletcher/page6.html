<div class="title">Tension in Fletcher's Trolley</div>

<p>We want to solve the two equations</p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="15"><i>T</i> =
<i>m<sub>1</sub>a</i>.<spacer type="horizontal" size="60">(1)

<p>and</p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="15"><i>W<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>T</i> =
<i>m<sub>2</sub>a</i><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">(2)

<p>for the tension <i>T</i>.  We have already solved for the
acceleration and found</p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="15"><i>a</i> =
[<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>/(<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>)]
<i>g</i>.<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">(5)

<p>Substituting this expression into equation (1) gives</p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="15"><i>T</i> =
[<i>m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub></i>/(<i>m<sub>1</sub></i> +
<i>m<sub>2</sub></i>)] <i>g</i>.<spacer type="horizontal"
size="25">(7)</p>

<p>Substituting the given values gives for the tension when the blocks
are in motion</p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="15"><i>T</i> = [0.6x0.4/(0.6 +
0.4)] x 9.8</p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="30">= 2.4 N.<spacer type="horizontal"
size="55">(8)</p>

<p>Note that this is <b>less</b> than the weight <i>W<sub>2</sub></i>
= 0.4x9.8 = 3.9 N.  When the blocks are in motion, the string tension
is less than the weight of block 2.  This must be so if block 2 is to
accelerate downward.  In order for block 2 to accelerate downward, the
net force on block 2 must be downward as well.  This will only be the
case if the weight of block 2 is greater than the tension!</P>

<p>Note, however, that when block 1 is held at rest, so that block 2
is at rest as well while suspended from the string, the tension in the
string must be equal to the weight of block 2, because in this case
the net force acting on block 2 is zero.  When block 1 is held at
rest, there must be a horizontal force acting on block 1 to the left
to counteract the tension force acting on block 1.  This horizontal
force must have a magnitude <i>F</i> equal to the tension in the
string, which at this moment is equal to the weight of block 2.</p>

<p><b>Final comments</b>. 

<p>(a) Verify that expressions (5) and (7) above for <i>a</i> and
<i>T</i> also satsify equation (2).</p>

<p>(b) Practise calculating the tension and the acceleration for different
mass values of block 2.  (The mass of block 1 is fixed at 0.6 kg.)
Then run the simulation and check your answers.</P>

<p>(c) The simulation also lets you set the pulley mass to a non-zero
value (by setting the moment of inertia of the pulley unequal to
zero).  In that case the tensions on the two sides of the pulley are
no longer equal.  If you are interested in seeing how to calculate the
two tensions and the acceleration in that case, go to Torque/About an
Axis/Apply It/Fletcher.</p>
