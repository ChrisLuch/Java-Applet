<div class="title">Acceleration in Fletcher's Trolley</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The magnitude of the acceleration of the two blocks
is 3.92 m s<sup>-2</sup>, assuming the masses of blocks 1 and 2 are
0.6 kg and 0.4 kg, respectively, and the acceleration due to gravity
is taken to have the magnitude g = 9.8 m s<sup>-2</sup>.</p>

<p>To calculate this value, we follow our standard four-step procedure
for problems involving Newton's second law.  (Newton's second law is
involved because the given situation involves forces and
accelerations.)</p>

<p><u>Step 1</u>.  Make free-body diagrams for all relevant objects,
which are blocks 1 and 2 in this case.  Click the fbd toggle button,
fifth button from the left, to display the fbd's for the two blocks.
Step through the motion using the second button from the left.  Notice
that the tensions <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> in the
strings where the strings are attached to the two blocks have one
value when the blocks are held at rest and a smaller value when the
blocks are in motion (animation paused).</p>

<p><u>Step 2</u>.  Draw axes and define their positive directions.
The axes that will be used here are displayed also when the fbd toggle
button is pressed.  The x-axis is horizontal and to the right and the
y-axis vertical and downward.</p>
