<div class="title">Acceleration in Fletcher's Trolley</div>

<p><u>Step 3</u>.  Write down the equations resulting when Newton's
second law is applied to all bodies for which fbd's have been drawn.
Also, write down any other equations that are necessary to solve the
problem and explain why these equations can be applied to the given
situation.</p>

<p><u>Newton 2 applied to block 1, x-direction only, when the blocks
are in motion</u>:

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="15"><i>T<sub>1</sub></i> =
<i>m<sub>1</sub>a</i>.<spacer type="horizontal" size="45">(1)

<p>where <i>a</i> is the x-component of acceleration of block 1.</p>

<p><u>Newton 2 applied to block 2, y-direction only, when the blocks
are in motion</u>:

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="15"><i>W<sub>2</sub></i> - <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> =
<i>m<sub>2</sub>a</i>.<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">(2)

<p>Since the string is inextensible, the y-component of acceleration
of block 2 is equal to the x-component of acceleration of block 1.  So
the same symbol <i>a</i> can be used for both in equations (1) and
(2).</p>

<p>Equations (1) and (2) involve <b>three</b> unknowns: the two
tensions <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i> and the
acceleration <i>a</i>.  We need a third equation to solve for the
three unknowns.  What do you think will be the third equation?</p>
