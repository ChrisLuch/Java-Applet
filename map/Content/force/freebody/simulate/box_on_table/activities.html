    <div class="title">Activities on Forces Within a Box-Table-Earth
    System and Free-Body Diagrams</div>

    <p>
      The following Activities are for the Box-on-Table applet.  Make
      sure you know how the applet functions by consulting Help,
      Assumptions, and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's Help
      menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 1</b>.  The purpose of Activity 1 is to learn the
      proper way of describing forces verbally and to place forces in
      free-body diagrams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term "force" in physics is related to the interaction between
      <b>two</b> objects.  A phrase like "a moving truck has a lot of
      force" has no meaning in physics because there is no force inherent
      in a truck no matter how fast the truck may be moving.  It does have
      meaning to talk about the "force exerted by the truck on a tree" if
      the truck collides with the tree.  This phrase refers to <b>two</b>
      objects, the truck and the tree.  In a collision, the truck and the
      tree are interacting with each other and can exert forces on each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proper way to refer to a force is by saying "the force exerted
      by ... on ... ", where the dots stand for the two objects that are
      interacting.  The word "force" may be modified by an adjective,
      e.g., "gravitational" or "normal", to further specify which force
      one is talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet.  Make sure the applet is in
      the Force mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      In your Notebook, make a drawing of the box-table-earth system.
      Also, start making free-body diagrams for the box, the table, and the
      earth by drawing a dot for each of these elements of the system,
      labeling the dots "Box", "Table", and "Earth" as in the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both in your drawing of the box-table-earth system and in the
      appropriate free-body diagram, draw the arrow representing the
      gravitational force exerted by the earth on the box.  Keep in mind
      that gravitational forces acting on an extended object like the box
      effectively act at the center of gravity of the object.  Thus, the
      tail end of a gravitational force vector should be placed at the
      center of gravity of the object on which the force is acting, the
      box in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the Force drop-down menus to select the gravitational force
      exerted by the earth on the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUBMIT your force selection, and compare the applet's response with
      what you have drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Continuing from Exercise 1, one of the two force
      vectors included in the applet's free-body diagram for the box, the
      gravitational force vector, is shown selected in green while the
      other vector is unselected and shown in grey.  Select the unselected
      grey vector via the Force drop-down menus, and add this other force
      vector to your drawing of the box-table-earth system.
    </p>
    <p>
      SUBMIT your selection, and compare the applet's response.  Does the
      applet select the other vector in the free-body diagram of the box?
      If so, you have correctly identified this force by its verbal
      description.  If not, change your selection and SUBMIT again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, does the applet draw the vector in the image of the system
      the way you have done in your drawing?  
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 3</b>.  Repeat Exercises 1 and 2 for the forces acting
      on the table and the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 2</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is to provide
      further practice with free-body diagrams and with the verbal
      description of forces.  This time, the applet will randomly select
      a force and you are expected to identify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 1</b>. RESET the applet. Select the Force Review mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet selects a force either by selecting a force vector in
      one of the three free-body diagrams or by selecting a verbal
      description of the force via the Force drop-down menus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respond by selecting the force by the "other" method, the one not
      chosen by the applet, and SUBMIT your response.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the applet responds with "Correct" in the Answer Quality text
      field, click NEXT and continue with another force.  Otherwise,
      change your response and SUBMIT again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercise 2</b>.  Continue in this manner until the applet has
      chosen all forces indicated in the three free-body diagrams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The applet will go through the eight forces indicated in the
      free-body diagrams in random order until all eight forces have been
      selected.
