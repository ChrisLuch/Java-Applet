    <div class="title">The Gravitational Force Exerted on a Planet by the Sun</div>

    <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the motion of a planet around the
    sun (or another fixed star), or the motion of a moon or satellite
    around a planet.</p>  

    <p>For detailed information on how to use the applet, go to Applet
    Help on the applet's Help menu and look at Help and ShowMe.  A
    Lesson accompanying the applet is available there as well.
    </p>

    <p>Note that the applet only exhibit's the planet's acceleration.
    The gravitational force exerted by the sun on the planet is in the
    same direction as this acceleration and has a magnitude equal to
    <i>ma</i> where <i>m</i> is the planet's mass and <i>a</i> the
    magnitude of the planet's acceleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Activities" under Related Items suggests investigations to be
      carried out with the applet on the gravitational force exerted by
      the sun on the planet.
