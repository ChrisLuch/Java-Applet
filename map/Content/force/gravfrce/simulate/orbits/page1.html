    <p>The Applet on Page 2 shows projectile motion and satellite motion
    in the earth's gravitational field. The projectile's or satellite's
    initial position and velocity can be varied.  The viewpoint can be
    changed from a point close to the earth's surface to a point far from
    the earth's surface.  The gravitational force acting on the
    projectile or satellite is simulated.

    <p>Detailed information on how to use the applet is available from
    Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
