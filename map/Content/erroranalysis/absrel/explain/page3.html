  <div class="subtitle"><center>Relative Error</center></div>

<p>On the left is the same object and ruler once more. This time,
though, the absolute uncertainty is given.</p>

<p>Your job is to enter a best estimate of the length and calculate
the <b>relative uncertainty</b> (relative error) -- that is, to
compare the size of the error to the measurement itself, and express
it as a percentage.</p>

<p>The relative uncertainty (relative error) is defined as the fraction

<p align="center">rel. err. = (abs. err.) / (best estimate) = <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>L</i> / <i>L</i>.</p>

<p>For example, if the absolute error is 2.5 m and the best
estimate is 20.0 m, the relative error is

<p align="center">relative error = 2.5 m / 20.0 m = 0.125 .</p>

<p>Note that a relative error is always a pure number.  It is
customary to express a relative error as percentage error. To convert
to a percentage, multiply the fraction representing the error by 100.
Thus, in the present example,

<p align="center">percentage error = 0.125&times;100 = 12.5% .</p>
