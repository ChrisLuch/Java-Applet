<h2>Question #4</h2>

<p>A laser is used to measure the distance between markers on two
mountaintops. The laser measures the <i>round-trip</i> distance from
the top of the first mountain, to a mirror on the top of the second,
and back to the top of the first mountain, as being 5150.7 m.  It
measures this round-trip distance to an accuracy of 20 cm.

<p>Given the angle between the two mountaintops as <i>exactly</i>
20&deg; above the horizontal, what is the relative error in the
<b>horizontal</b> distance between the two mountaintops?</p>

<li>0.1 m</li>

<li>8&#0215;10<sup>-3</sup>%</li>
<li>4&#0215;10<sup>-3</sup>%</li>
</ol>
