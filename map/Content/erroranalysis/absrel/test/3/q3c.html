<p>This is a straightforward calculation of relative error.  The only
thing about which you need to be careful are the units:</p>

<p align="center">relative error = (absolute error)/(measurement
value) 

<p align="center">= (2 mm)/(2.6 cm) = (2 mm)/(26 mm) = 2/26 = 0.077 =
7.7% .</p>

<p>That brings up an interesting and helpful subject -- the idea of
<i>dimensional analysis</i>. We can use the units of multiplied or
divided quantities to check our formulae for accuracy.</p>

<p>Let's use this case as a simple example. <i>Absolute</i> error
might be a number of centimetres, seconds, or some other
unit. <i>Relative</i> error is always a dimensionless quantity, which
means that in the division of the absolute error by the measurement
value the units should cancel.</p>

<p>In this question, that meant either changing the measurement value
(2.6 cm) into millimetres, or changing the absolute uncertainty (2 mm)
into centimetres. Either way, the two quantities would have the same
units and division be straightforward.</p>

<p>Dimensional analysis becomes extremely useful in areas of physics
like kinematics, where there are lots of equations that would be hard
to memorize. You don't need to memorize most elements of these
equations.  Dimensional analysis will tell you almost everything,
except for the numerical factors.

<p>For example, an ubiquitous equation in one-dimensional kinematics
is
<b><i>x</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>x</i><sub>o</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>v</i><sub>o</sub><font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;&#0189;<i>a</i>(<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>)<sup>2</sup></b> -- work out the units
of every quantity, and you'll see they all turn out to be metres. Very
handy, and not too hard.</p>
