<p>Again, this is a judgement call. The ruler is only marked to the
nearest centimetre, which means we can estimate a value for tenths of
a centimetre. However, there will be some uncertainty in this -- after
all, it's just a guess (but an educated one at that).</p>

<p>If the conditions are ideal -- the markings on the ruler are
clearly visible, there's lots of light in the room, the ruler is held
perfectly still, you're looking straight-on at the book and ruler --
the uncertainty will probably be 0.1 cm. Conditions rarely are ideal,
though ... so a more realistic estimate might be 0.2 cm for the
uncertainty.</p>

<p>To summarize, the amount of uncertainty in a measurement isn't set
in stone. It depends on the situation and the conditions at the
time. It's your decision, but be reasonable.</p>
