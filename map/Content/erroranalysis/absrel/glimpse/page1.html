<p>As explained in Errors/Basic Facts/Explain It, we always must
include a certain amount of <i>error</i> or <i>uncertainty</i> when
reporting a measurement result. This is a fact of life -- we can't
know physical quantities, e.g., lengths and times, exactly. Our
equipment and our senses have inherent limitations in them.

<p>There are two main ways to represent uncertainties: in an
<i>absolute</i> sense, and in a <i>relative</i> sense. The first
method is the most straightforward... if someone says, &quot;My height
is 68 inches, give-or-take one inch,&quot; that
&quot;give-or-take&quot; value of one inch is your <i>absolute</i>
uncertainty. However, if someone says, &quot;My mass is 70 kg,
give-or-take 5%,&quot; the &quot;5%&quot; is a <i>relative</i>
uncertainty, since the actual (absolute) uncertainty (in kilograms)
depends on the person's mass -- the heavier the person, the greater the
absolute uncertainty if the relative uncertainty is always 5%.</p>

<p>Absolute error can be converted into relative error and vice versa.
So both contain the same amount of information.  However, sometimes it
is more convenient to present the information in one way rather than
the other.  E.g., if you want to convey an impression of the accuracy
of a result, an uncertainty of 0.1% suggests a pretty accurate result.
However, if you report the corresponding absolute uncertainty as 2 m,
then this does not look very accurate at all, until you point out that
the measured quantity has a length of 2000 m.
