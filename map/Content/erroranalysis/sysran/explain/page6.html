<div class="title"><center>Analyzing The Counted Times</center></div>

<p>Most of your times were probably fairly close to the target time,
but there was definitely a &quot;spread&quot; in the data. This is
expected -- you aren't going to be able to count the same (or the
correct) time every time.</p>

<p>The amount of &quot;spread&quot; in the data is related to how much
<b>random error</b> there is. As you can probably tell, this type of
uncertainty has no real pattern to it, other than that it's
&quot;clumped&quot; around some central point ... which, hopefully, is
fairly close to the target time.</p>

<p>One measure of how much spread there is in a set of data is the
<b>standard deviation</b> (SD). Remember, about two-thirds of all data
points fall between 1 SD below the mean and 1 SD above the mean.</p>
