<div class="title"><center>Random Error</center></div>

<p>On the left is an applet that tests your ability to
&quot;count&quot; a length of time in your head. </p>

<p>First, the applet will demonstrate how to count time.  An amount of
time is indicated in yellow inside a yellow rectangular border.  Click
the &quot;Demonstrate&quot; button to see a count-down of this time.

<p>Then, if you click the &quot;Go on your own&quot; button, you're on
your own for ten trials.  A target time will be displayed, and there
will be a &quot;Start&quot; button.  Click the &quot;Start&quot;
button, and the invisible clock will be running.  Click the button
again - it will have turned into a &quot;Stop&quot; button - when you
think the target time has elapsed.

<p>After each trial, you will be shown the &quot;target&quot; time and
&quot;your&quot; time... you might need to make some adjustments.</p>

<p>After the ten trials, click a &quot;View Results&quot; button to
have your results displayed in a bar graph. Good luck.</p>
