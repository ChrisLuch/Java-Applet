<div class="title"><center>Handling Systematic Error</center></div>

<p>Some common examples of systematic error found in physics
experiments and calculations might be:</p>

<ul>

<li>using a metre stick that's calibrated incorrectly</li>

<li>forgetting to find (and use) the zero reading on a micrometer</li>

<li>merely cutting off insignificant digits instead of rounding them properly</li>

</ul>

<p>So now the question becomes: <i>How does one minimize these
errors?</i> The short answer is, <b>be careful</b>. Most systematic
error comes from improper use of equipment or from careless
calculations. Make sure you read scales properly, perform calculations
carefully, and, when in doubt, talk to somebody.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, though, that with all the care in the world, you'll
probably never truly get rid of systematic error and that you will
always have to remain on the lookout for this kind of error.</p>

<p>If you keep looking for systematic error in your experiments, you
may become aware of sources of systematic error that you can try to
eliminate or, if that is not possible, try to quantify so that you can
make appropriate corrections in your calculations.</p>
