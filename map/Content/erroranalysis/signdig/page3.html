<h2 align="center">How many digits to keep?</h2>

<p>We found the area of the Object to be 0.2242 ± 0.02390... cm<sup>2</sup>. However, there's a question as to how many digits we should keep, since we certainly can't keep them all.</p>

<p>Since the uncertainty figure is nowhere near exact -- remember, the choice of the absolute uncertainty in <font face="times"><i>L</i></font> and <font face="times"><i>W</i></font> were somewhat arbitrary -- we should round that off.</p>

<p>As far as the Object's area goes, there's a general convention that dictates how many digits we keep. If the first nonzero digit is small (a 0 or a 1), two digits are kept. If that digit isn't small, <i>one</i> digit is kept. In our area example, the first nonzero digit is a 2, so we round the uncertainty to 0.02. (If we happened to find the error was 0.012390..., we would probably keep the first <i>two</i> digits, making the error 0.012.)</p>

<p>So now we have &quot;the area of the Object is 0.2242 ± 0.02 cm<sup>2</sup>&quot;. But then that makes the thousandths and ten-thousandths decimal places of the area worthless -- how can we know them if there's an uncertainty of two <i>hundredths</i>? It makes sense, then, that the last digit of the error determines the last digit of the quantity being measured or calculated.</p>

<p>Finally, now, we can say <b>the area of the Object is 0.22 ± 0.02 cm<sup>2</sup></b>. (If that seems like a lot of uncertainty, it is -- remember, there was a huge relative uncertainty on the Object's width, which dominates the error of area.)</p>
