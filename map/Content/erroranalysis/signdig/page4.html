<h2 align="center">A Summary</h2>

<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when deciding how many significant figures to keep:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep all the digits your calculator gives you, and round at the very end.</b><br>
If you round to, say, one significant digit every time, you're going to lose a lot of information. If you keep all these digits, your final result will most likely be more accurate.</li>
<li><b>Use the right uncertainty formula.</b><br>
Double-check the formula before you barrel ahead and use it. If it so satisfies you, derive it from first principles.</li>
<li><b>Keep absolute and relative uncertainties straight.</b><br>
A good way to do this is by carefully keeping track of units -- if you divide something in centimetres by something else in centimetres, the units will cancel and the number is dimensionless (i.e., a ratio).</li>
<li><b>Uncertainties contain either one or two nonzero digits.</b><br>
There's no point in saying &quot;the uncertainty in the time is 1.5532432 s -- the extra digits are superfluous. Same goes for relative (or percentage) uncertainties -- 0.77986% is a little excessive.</li>
<li><b>A quantity's number of significant digits depends on its uncertainty.</b><br>
If your uncertainty is 0.5 m, don't bother to say the measurement is 22.0477 m -- everything past the tenths is uncertain anyways.</li>
</ul>
