<div class="title">Accuracy vs. Precision</div>

<p>Let's take a closer look at the dartboards.</p>

  <table  cellspacing="10" >
    <tr>
      <td><img src="dartbd.gif" align="left"></td>

<td>

<b>#1 -- Not Precise, Not Accurate</b><br> This dart thrower needs
some lessons -- the darts are nowhere near the centre of the board,
and they're all over the place.

<p><b>#2 -- Precise, But Not Accurate</b><br> The darts here are
<i>precise</i> -- that is, they're really close together. However,
they're not <i>accurate</i> -- they're far from the centre of the
board.</p>

<p><b>#3 -- Not Precise, But Accurate</b><br> The darts are not
precise -- they're not close together, but they're fairly accurate by
being close to the bull's-eye.</p>

<p><b>#4 -- Precise And Accurate</b><br> The darts are precise, since
they're close together, and they're accurate, since they're right at
the centre of the board.</p>

</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Next we'll formalize these distinctions and see how they apply to
error analysis in general.</p>
