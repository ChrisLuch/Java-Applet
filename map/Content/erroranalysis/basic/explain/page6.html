<div class="title">The Standard Deviation</div>

<p>So, what is this mythical &quot;Standard Deviation&quot;?</p>

<p>The short answer is: <i>it gives an idea about how much
&quot;spread&quot; there is in a set of data</i>. About 68% of all the
points in a &quot;normally-distributed&quot; data set will be between
1 SD below the mean, and 1 SD above the mean.  These 68% are shown in
green.</p>

<p>To see what this means, consider two different normal distributions:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="curves.gif"></p>

<p>The second distribution has a much larger SD, and the data are more
spread out. The green areas, though, encompass the same percentage of
all the data points -- about 68%. So, <i>the bigger the SD, the more
spread out the data are</i>.</p>
