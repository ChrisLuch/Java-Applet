<p>If you use Expression (2) from Page 8,

<p align="center"><img src="sdprac.gif"> <img src="small.gif"
height="1" width="50"></p>

<p>you have to calculate the sample mean <i>m</i>, find the deviation
of each measurement from this mean, square each deviation,
sum the squared deviations, divide the sum by the number of
measurements minus 1, and take the square-root of that.</p>

<p>The sample mean works out to be 

<p><img src="small.gif" height="1" width="80"><img src="mean.gif"></p>

<p><img src="small.gif" height="1" width="102">= (1.18 + 1.16 + 1.18 +
1.19 + 1.21) / 5 = 1.184 m.

<p>It is meaningful to quote <i>m</i> to one decimal more than the
individual measurements, both to avoid round-off error in the
following calculation and because the mean is a more precise value
than the individual measurements.

<p>The five measurements deviate from the mean by -0.004 m, -0.024 m,
-0.004 m, 0.006 m and 0.026 m.  (Note that the sum of these deviations
is zero.  This is one reason why the SD uses the sum of the squares of the
deviations to measure the spread of the distribution.)

<p>If you square each of the five deviations and add the squared
deviations, you get 0.00132 m<sup>2</sup>.  Divide by the number of
measurements minus 1, i.e., by 4, then take the square-root of that
and you get 0.0181659 m for <i>s</i>. You can round that to <b>0.018
m</b> since there is no point in calculating the standard deviation to
more than one decimal beyond the decimals of the original data. The
number of decimals in 0.018 is the same as in the value of the sample
mean quoted above.  Thus, we take the best estimate of the SD based on
the given sample as</p>

<p align="center"><i>s</i> = 0.018 m .</p>

<p>If you use Expression (3) from Page 8,

<p align="center"><img src="sdprac2.gif"> <img src="small.gif"
height="1" width="50"></p>

<p>you first add the squares of the five measurement values, which
gives 7.0106 m<sup>2</sup>; then you subtract <i>n</i> times the
square of the sample mean, i.e., 5&times;1.184<sup>2</sup> = 7.00928,
which gives 0.00132; you divide this by <i>n</i> - 1, i.e., 4, and
take the square root.  The result is 0.0182 m after rounding, which is
the same as above.  If you carry all decimals in both calculations,
both calculations will give exactly the same result to all decimals.
