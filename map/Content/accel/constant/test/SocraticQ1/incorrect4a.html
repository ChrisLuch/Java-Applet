      <div>A car (<font color="#3366FF">c</font>) with one headlight burned
      out is traveling at a constant speed of 18 m/s and passes a stopped
      police car (<font color="#FF0000">p</font>). The car is pursued
      immediately by the police cruiser, which has a constant acceleration
      of magnitude 2.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</div>

      <div>(a) How far does the police cruiser travel before catching the
      other car?</div>

      <div>(b) At what time will this occur? (Hint: Graphing may help to
      visualize this problem.)</div>

      <p><hr WIDTH="100%">

      <p><font color="#FF0000">No</font>.  Certainly at some time the
      velocities of the two cars will be instantaneously equal, but that is
      not the time when the cars are at the same position.  The time when
      the velocities are equal is <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, but we want time
      <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>.
