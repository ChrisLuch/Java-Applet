      <br>

      <div>A car (<font color="#3366FF">c</font>) with one
      headlight burned out is traveling at a constant speed of 18 m/s and passes
      a stopped police car (<font color="#FF6666">p</font>). The car is pursued
      immediately by the police cruiser, which has a constant acceleration of
      magnitude 2.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</div>

      <div>(a) How far does the police cruiser travel before
      catching the other car?</div>

      <div>(b) At what time will this occur? (Hint: Graphing
      may help to visualize this problem.)</div>
