      <div><b>Car Chase</b></div>

      <br>

      <div>A car (<font color="#3366FF">c</font>) with one headlight burned
      out is traveling at a constant speed of 18 m/s and passes a stopped
      police car (<font color="#FF0000">p</font>). The car is pursued
      immediately by the police cruiser, which has a constant acceleration
      of magnitude 2.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</div>

      <div>(a) How far does the police cruiser travel before catching the
      other car?</div>

      <div>(b) At what time will this occur? (Hint: Graphing may help to
      visualize this problem.)</div>

      <div><hr WIDTH="100%"></div>

      <p><font color="orange">Accumulated solution</font>: <br>

      <p>Position of the car:

      <p><i>x</i><sub>c</sub> = <i>v</i><sub>0c</sub><i>t</i>

      <p>Position of the police cruiser:

      <p><i>x</i><sub>p</sub> = <i>v</i><sub>0p</sub><i>t</i>

      + &frac12; <i>at</i><sup>2</sup> 

      <p><hr WIDTH="100%">

      <p>In order for us to find the distance traveled by the cars, which is
      equal to their position at the time they meet, we must:

      <blockquote>(a) set <i>x</i><sub>p</sub>
      = <i>x</i><sub>c</sub> in the two equations and solve for <i>t</i>

      <br>(b) set <i>x</i><sub>p</sub> = <i>x</i><sub>c</sub> = <i>x</i>
      and eliminate <i>t</i> between the two equations.</blockquote>
