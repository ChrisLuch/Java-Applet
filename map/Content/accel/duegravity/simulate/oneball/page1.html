<div class="title">
  Projectile Motion With or Without Air Resistance
</div>

<p>The applet on Page 2 shows the motion of a ball performing
projectile motion, with or without air resistance.
</p>

<p>Detailed information on how the applet functions and two lessons on
projectile motion, including a lesson on air resistance, are available
under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.  For activities to be
carried out with the applet, see A1 to A4 under Related Items.
</p>

<p>
  About the assumptions made about air resistance in the applet and
  the definition of the drag coefficient, see Assumptions under Applet
  Help.
