	<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">5. Calculate the magnitude of ball's acceleration due to air resistance

	<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">From your activities in the previous part you will have gathered the
	following point. As the ball is falling back down from the top, its speed increases from 0 but approaches a constant
	value. This constant value is known as terminal speed and the corresponding velocity is called terminal velocity.
	Now answer a few questions about the terminal speed/velocity.</FONT></P>

	<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">9. As the ball's speed approaches terminal speed, the ball's acceleration</FONT></P>

	the very beginning of these activities.</FONT></P>

	<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial">11. If you double the initial velocity of the ball, the terminal velocity of the
	ball will</FONT></P>

	<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial">(a) quadruple because the magnitude of the acceleration due to air resistance will
	quadruple<BR>
	(b) double because the magnitude of the acceleration due to air resistance will double<BR>
	(c) will remain the same because the terminal velocity is independent of the initial velocity for a given object.<BR>
	(d) halve because the magnitude of the acceleration due to air resistance will double<BR>
	(e) be reduced to one fourth because the magnitude of the acceleration due to air resistance will quadruple</FONT></P>

	<P><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Arial">12. If you double the mass of the ball without changing the initial velocity, will
	the terminal velocity of the ball change? If yes, what the new value will be?</FONT></P>
