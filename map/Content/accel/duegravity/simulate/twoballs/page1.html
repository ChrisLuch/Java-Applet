        <div class="title">
        Simulation of Simultaneous Projectile Motions of Two Balls With or
        Without Air Resistance
        </div>

        <p>The applet is on Page 2.  Under Useful Items, in the lower left
        corner of the window, the following activities are suggested for the
        applet:

        <p><ul>

        <p><li>A1: The Effect of Mass on Projectile Motion.</li>

        <p><li>A2: One Ball Dropped From Rest, One Ball Launched Horizontally.</li>

        <li>A3: Intersecting Trajectories</li>

        <p><li>A4: Two Balls Launched Horizontally From The Same Height But
        Different Horizontal Positions And With Different Speeds</li>

        <p><li>A5: Two Balls Launched From The Same Height With Equal
        Horizontal And Different Vertical Velocity Components.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Detailed information on how the applet functions and a lesson on
        projectile motion are available under Help in the top left corner of
        the applet.

        <p>The applet shows the motions of two balls performing projectile
        motion simultaneously.  One ball (red) always moves without air
        resistance and is subject only to gravity.  The other ball (yellow)
        moves with an acceleration consisting of two parts: one due to gravity
        and one due to air resistance.  The former is constant, the latter has
        magnitude proportional to the square of the ball's speed and direction
        opposite to the ball's velocity.

        <p>Expressed in symbols, the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components of the
        yellow ball's acceleration, <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>a<sub>y</sub></i>,
        are equal to:

        <p><div align="center"><i>a<sub>x</sub></i> =
        -(<i>C</i>/<i>m</i>)<i>v</i><i>v<sub>x</sub></i>

        <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="20"> and <img src="small.gif"
        height="1" width="20">

        <i>a<sub>y</sub></i> = -<i>g</i> -
        (<i>C</i>/<i>m</i>)<i>v</i><i>v<sub>y</sub></i>,
        </div>

        <p>where <i>C</i> is the drag coefficient (adjustable), <i>m</i> the
        ball's mass (adjustable), <i>v</i> the ball's speed,
        <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> the <i>x</i> and
        <i>y</i>-components of the ball's velocity (initial velocity
        adjustable), and <i>g</i> the magnitude of the acceleration due to
        gravity (adjustable).

        <p>The <i>x</i>-axis is horizontal and points to the right, and the
        <i>y</i>-axis is vertical and points upward.

        <p>These two equations can be expressed by the one vector equation

        <p align="center"><img src="a.gif" align="bottom"> = <img src="g.gif"
        align="absbottom"> - (<i>C</i>/<i>m</i>) <i>v</i> <img src="v.gif"
        align="bottom"> .</p>
