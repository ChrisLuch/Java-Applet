  <div class="title">Comparison of Times Required by Two Balls to Reach the
  Intersection Point of Their Trajectories</div>

  <p align="center"><img src="TwoBallsMeet.gif"></p>

  <p>The diagram shows the trajectories of two balls traveling without
  air resistance after being launched simultaneously at the origin.
  Both balls are launched with the same speed, but with different
  launch angles. Ball 1 (red trajectory) is launched at a smaller
  angle and Ball 2 (yellow trajectory) at a larger angle.

  <p>The balls' trajectories intersect at some point. 

  <p><b>Question</b>. Which of the following statements is true?
