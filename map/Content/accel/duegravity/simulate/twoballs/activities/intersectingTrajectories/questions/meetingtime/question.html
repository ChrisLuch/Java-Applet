  <div class="title">Times Required by Two Balls to Reach the
  Intersection Point of Their Trajectories</div>

  <p align="center"><img src="TwoBallsMeet.gif"></p>

  <p>The diagram shows the trajectories of two balls traveling without
  air resistance after being launched simultaneously at the origin.
  Both balls are launched with the same speed of 30.0 m/s, but with
  different launch angles.  Ball 1 (red trajectory) is launched at an
  angle of 48.2<sup>o</sup> and Ball 2 (yellow trajectory) at an angle
  of 60.0<sup>o</sup>.

  <p>Their trajectories intersect at a point with (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)
  coordinates

  <p align="center">(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)<sub>intersect</sub> = (64.4,
  21.4) m.</p>

  <p><b>Question</b>. If <i>t<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>t<sub>2</sub></i>
  are the times at which Balls 1 and 2 reach the point where their
  trajectories intersect, what is the difference <i>t<sub>1</sub></i>
  - <i>t<sub>2</sub></i> between these times in seconds?
