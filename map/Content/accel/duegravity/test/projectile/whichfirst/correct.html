  <p>Yes, Ball 1 gets to the intersection point first.

  <p><b>Reason</b>.  Since both balls have the same initial speed, the
  ball with the smaller launch angle, i.e., Ball 1, must have the
  greater horizontal velocity component.  This means this ball is
  moving faster horizontally and will cover any horizontal
  displacement in less time than the ball with the greater launch
  angle.

  <p>For a quantitative version of this question, go to
  Acceleration/Due to Gravity/Test Yourself/Projectile Motion/Intersection Times.
