  <div class="title">Effect of Launch Speed on Range</div>

  <p>A ball is thrown with speed <i>v<sub>0</sub></i> in a direction
  that forms an angle <font face="symbol">q</font> with the
  horizontal.  The range <i>R</i> is the ball's horizontal
  displacement from the start to the point at which the ball returns
  to the same horizontal level.  Assume that the ball experiences no
  air resistance.</p>

  <p>When the launch speed is doubled while the launch angle remains
  the same, the range</p>

  <p>

  <ol>

  <li><u>is halved</u> because doubling the launch speed cuts the time
  of flight in half so that the ball can go only half as far</li>

  <p><li><u>remains the same</u> because doubling the launch speed
  cuts the time of flight in half, but the ball will go twice as fast;
  so half the time elapsed and double the speed results in the same
  range</li>

  <p><li><u>is doubled</u>; reason: when the launch speed is doubled
  the time of flight stays the same (the time to reach the top stays
  the same because the ball goes twice as fast and has twice as far to
  go up); thus, since the horizontal velocity component is doubled,
  the ball travels twice as far in the same time</li>

  <p><li><u>is quadrupled</u>; reason: when the launch speed is
  doubled both the horizontal and vertical velocity components are
  doubled; doubling the vertical component implies that the time to
  the top gets doubled because it takes twice as long to reduce this
  velocity component to zero; thus, the total travel time doubles
  since it is equal to twice the time to the top; double the travel
  time multiplied by double the horizontal velocity component gives
  four times the horizontal displacement</li>

  </ol>
