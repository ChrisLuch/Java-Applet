  <p>Does the time of flight get cut in half when the launch speed gets doubled?</p>

  <p>The total time of flight is twice the time to the top.  By what
  factor does the time to the top change when the launch speed and,
  therefore, the vertical velocity component are doubled?  Look at the
  equation for the vertical velocity as a function of time in
  Equations under Get Information.</p>
