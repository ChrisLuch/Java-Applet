  <div class="title">Incorrect</div>

  <p><b>Hint</b>: The vector you have selected points in the
  centrifugal direction when attached to the particle at its given
  position.  

  <p>The acceleration vector when drawn with its tail end at a moving
  particle never points to the outside of the particle's path, no matter
  how the particle may be moving.
