<div class="title">Activities on Velocity in Circular Motion</div>

<p>In all of the following Activities, keep all of the applet's eight
slider settings fixed at their default values except for that of the
time step <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>.  Change that as
instructed in the Activities.

<p><b>Activities</b>

<p><ol>

<li>Display two vectors: the position vector of the mass point and the
velocity vector of the mass point, the latter with its tail end at the
mass point (select "velocity at particle" in the Vector Panel).  Set
the applet to the Continuous mode.  Display the position trace (Trace
P), but not the velocity trace (Trace V).

<p>Play the motion, and pause it at several instants.  Make a drawing
of the mass point's path and of the mass point's position and velocity
vectors at the instants when you pause the motion.

<p>In a sentence or two, characterize how the direction of the
velocity vector is related to that of the position vector and how the
velocity vector is oriented relative to the mass point's path.  Can
you confirm the following general statement about the direction of the
velocity vector?

<blockquote>The velocity vector at a given instant points in the
direction in which the tip of the position vector is moving at that
instant, which is the direction of the tangent to the mass point's path
at that instant.</blockquote>

<p>What do you observe about the magnitude of the velocity vector
during the motion?</li>

<p><li>The purpose of Activity 2 is to obtain an understanding of the
general (indented) statement on velocity in Activity 1 that is based
solely on the definition of velocity as time-rate-of-change of
position.

<p>Continuing from Activity 1, click Rewind and set the applet to the
Incremental mode and the time step to <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> = 0.50 s.

<p>Use the Step button to take one step into the motion.  Make a
drawing of the position vectors <img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r"
align="bottom"><sub>i</sub> and <img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r"
align="bottom"><sub>f</sub> at the beginning and end of the time step,
the displacement vector <font face="symbol">D</font><img
src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom"> during the time
step, and the velocity vectors <img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom"><sub>i</sub> and <img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom"><sub>f</sub> at the beginning and end of the time step.
Estimate the angles between the initial and final velocity vectors and
between the displacement and initial velocity vectors.

<p>In a sentence or two, describe how the direction of the
displacement vector is related to those of the initial and final
velocity vectors and by how much the directions of all these vectors
differ.

<p>Click Rewind, reduce the time step to <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> = 0.25 s, and again take the first step
into the motion.  Again, draw all vectors and estimate the angles
between the initial and final velocity vectors and between the initial
velocity and displacement vectors.

<p>Again, describe how the direction of the displacement vector
compares to those of the initial and final velocity vectors and how
the displacement vector during the 0.25-s time step compares to that
during the 0.50-s time step.

<p>Click Replay, and repeat these observations once more for a time
step <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> = 0.10 s.  

<p>Velocity is defined as the limit of the ratio <font
face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r"
align="bottom">/<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> as <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> approaches 0.  As <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> approaches 0, does the direction of
<nobr><font face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector
r" align="bottom">/<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i></nobr>, which
is the same as that of <font face="symbol">D</font><img
src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom">, approach the
direction of the velocity at the beginning of the time interval?

<p>The displacement <font face="symbol">D</font><img
src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom"> forms a cord of the
mass point's path.  Do you observe that as <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> approaches 0 the direction of the cord
approaches that of the tangent to the path at the mass point's initial
position?

<p>In what sense do the observations in Activity 2 confirm the general
statement from Activity 1?

<blockquote>The velocity vector at a given instant points in the
direction in which the tip of the position vector is moving at that
instant, which is the direction of the tangent to the mass point's path
at that instant.</blockquote>

</li>

<p><li>This activity is a repeat of Activity 2 with numbers. 

<p>Continuing from Activity 2, click Rewind, change the step size back
to <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> = 0.50 s, and display the Data
box.  Make sure the applet is still in the Incremental mode and that
no other settings have changed.

<p>Take one step into the motion.  Record the values of <font
face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r"
align="bottom"> and <font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i>, and work out
the ratio <font face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif"
alt="vector r" align="bottom">/<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> in
terms of its <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> scalar components.  Compare this ratio
to the initial velocity <img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom"><sub>i</sub>.

<p>Using the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> scalar components of <font
face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r"
align="bottom">/<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> worked out above
and the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> scalar components of <img src="v_orange.gif"
alt="vector v" align="bottom"><sub>i</sub> listed in the Data box,
draw the two vectors <font face="symbol">D</font><img
src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom">/<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> and <img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector
v" align="bottom"><sub>i</sub>.  Draw them with their tail ends joined
for better comparison.  For better accuracy, you may want to draw the
vectors on graph paper.

<p>As in Activity 2, repeat this with time steps equal to 0.25 s and
0.10 s.

<p>Does <font face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector
r" align="bottom">/<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> approach
<img src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"><sub>i</sub> as
the size of the time step decreases?

<p>The applet will let you choose time steps smaller than <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> = 0.10 s, but the values of <font
face="symbol">D</font><img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r"
align="bottom">/<font face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> will become
unreliable as the time step becomes too small because of a loss of
significant figures.  This is evident visually as well because the
displacement vector <font face="symbol">D</font><img
src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r" align="bottom"> becomes hard to
recognize.</li>

<p><li>Repeat Activities 2 and 3 at a different point of the mass
point's path.  E.g., after clicking Replay, drag the mass point to a
point with phase <font face="symbol">d</font> = 1 rad. (<font
face="symbol">d</font> is the first item in the Data box).  Use this
point as the initial point for observations like those in Activities 2
and 3.
