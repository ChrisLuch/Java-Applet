  <div class="title">Magnitude of the Radial Acceleration</div>

  <p><b>Final Remarks</b></p>
  
  <p><ul>

  <li>The acceleration of particle moving with constant speed <i>v</i>,
  and constant angular speed <font face="symbol">w</font>, in a circle
  of radius <i>r</i> is in the radial direction and has a magnitude
  <i>a</i> given by the following equations.

  <p align="center">
   <i>a</i> = <i>r</i> <font face="symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup> .<img
   src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40">(5)
  </p>

  <p>and

  <p align="center">
   <i>a</i> = <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>r</i> .<img src="small.gif"
   alt="space" height="1" width="40">(6)
  </p></li>

  <p><li>If the particle's motion is circular, but not uniform, so
  that the speed and angular speed are changing, the direction of the
  particle's acceleration is no longer radial, but has an additional
  tangential component.  The applet on Page 5 simulates this if you
  set the angular acceleration <font face="symbol">a</font> or the
  time-rate-of-change of speed <i>dv</i>/<i>dt</i> to a non-zero
  value.

  <p>For such motion, the magnitude of the radial component of the
  acceleration is still given by Expressions (5) and (6), but the
  magnitude <i>a</i> of the total acceleration is larger because it
  must reflect the presence of the non-zero tangential component also.

  <p><b>Task</b>.  Go to the applet on Page 5, and set
  <i>dv</i>/<i>dt</i> to a non-zero value and <i>r</i> and <i>v</i>(0)
  to values of your choice.  Play the applet, and Pause it at some
  point.  Calculate the magnitude of the radial component of the
  acceleration at this instant using the necessary data from the Data
  box of the applet.  Compare your answer for <i>a<sub>rad</sub></i>
  with that given in the Data box.  A slight discrepancy would be due
  to round-off error because the Data box displays its data to a
  limited number of significant digits.</li>

  <p><li>For general motions that are neither circular nor uniform,
  the acceleration can still be thought of as consisting of a radial
  and tangential component.  The radial direction in this case refers
  to that of a so-called <i>circle of curvature</i> that can be smoothly
  fitted into the particle's tracjectory.  The radial direction is
  perpendicular to the trajectory at the given point.  

  <p>Even in this most general case, the magnitude of the radial
  component of the acceleration is still given by Expressions (5) or
  (6) with <i>r</i> now being the radius of the circle of curvature.
  The applet simulates only circular motion and therefore cannot
  demonstrate this most general case.</li>
