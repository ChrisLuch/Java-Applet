  <p>The definition of velocity as time-rate-of-change of position implies that

  <blockquote>the direction of the velocity vector at a given instant
  coincides with the direction in which the tip of the position vector
  is moving at that instant, which means that the velocity vector when
  attached to the tip of the position vector lies along the tangent to
  the particle's path at the given instant.</blockquote>

  <p>The analogous definition of acceleration as time-rate-of-change
  of velocity implies that

  <blockquote>the direction of the acceleration vector at a given
  instant coincides with the direction in which the tip of the
  velocity vector is moving at that instant, where the tail end of the
  velocity vector must be held fixed as in Pair 2.</blockquote>

  <p>The velocity vector must have its tail end fixed just like the
  position vector has its tail end fixed.  Otherwise, the motion of
  the tip of the velocity vector would not represent the changes <font
  face="symbol">D</font><img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
  align="bottom"> in the velocity vector in the definition of
  acceleration, just as the motion of the tip of the position vector
  represents the changes <font face="symbol">D</font><img src="r.gif"
  alt="vector r" align="bottom"> in the position vector in the
  definition of velocity.

  <p>The image at the top shows the path (magenta) traced by the
  tip of the velocity vector in Pair 2.  For constant speed
  <i>v</i>, this velocity path is a circle just like the position path
  (blue) traced by the tip of the position vector.  The acceleration
  vector at a given instant must point along the tangent to the
  velocity path at that instant because the tip of the velocity vector
  is moving in the direction of the tangent.  The image at the top
  illustrates the tangential direction of the acceleration vector.

  <p><b>Task</b>. Work with the applet on Page 4 to deepen your
  understanding of these explanations.  Carry out the Activities on
  Acceleration suggested in the Link under Related Items.
