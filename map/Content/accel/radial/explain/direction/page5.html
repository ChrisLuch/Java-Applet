  <p><b>Final Remarks</b></p>

 <p><ul>

 <li>The image shows two copies of the acceleration vector of a
 particle performing uniform circular motion.  One copy is attached to
 the tip of the velocity vector, as in the image on Pages 1 and 3.
 The other copy is attached to the particle.  It is the latter copy
 that shows most clearly why the direction of the acceleration is
 described as "radial" or "centripetal".  The word "centripetal" is
 derived from Latin and means "center-seeking".   

 <p>Note, however, that if the acceleration vector is attached to the
 center of the circle like the velocity vector, its direction is away
 from the center rather than towards it.  Its direction is still
 radial.  The applet on Page 4 can display the acceleration vector
 when it is attached to the center of the circle.  Select
 "acceleration at origin" from the Vector Panel.

 <p>An unambiguous way of stating what the direction of the
 acceleration vector is to say that its direction is opposite to that
 of the position vector.</li>

 <p><li>The reasoning presented here that shows that the acceleration
 vector points in the direction of motion of the tip of the velocity
 vector, when that vector's tail end is fixed, and therefore in the
 direction of the tangent to the velocity path applies also when the
 motion is not uniform.  This case is considered under
 Kinematics/Acceleration/Tangential/.  You can explore it on your own
 with the applet on Page 4 by setting
 <i>dv</i>/<i>dt</i> to a non-zero value.</li>
