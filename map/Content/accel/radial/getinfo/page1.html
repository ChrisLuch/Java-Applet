  <div class="title">Acceleration in Uniform Circular Motion</div>

  <p align="center">

  </p>

  <p>The image shows the acceleration vector of a particle (black dot)
  performing uniform circular motion.  Although the particle's
  <b>speed</b> is constant, the particle's <b>velocity</b> is not
  constant because it changes direction while the particle is moving
  around the circle.  Therefore the particle's acceleration is not
  zero.
  </p>
  <p> One describes the direction of the acceleration as "radial" or
  "centripetal", radial because it is along the radius of the
  particle's circular path and "centripetal" because it points from the
  particle towards the center of the particle's path.  (The word
  "centripetal" is derived from Latin and means "center-seeking".)
  </p>
  <p>The magnitude <i>a</i> of the acceleration is given by the
  following two expressions:

  <p align="center">
   <i>a</i> = <i>r</i> <font face="symbol">w</font><sup>2</sup> =
   <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>r</i> 
  </p>

  <p>
   where <i>r</i> is the radius of the particle's circular path,
   <i>v</i> the particle's speed, and <font face="symbol">w</font> the
   particle's angular speed.
  </p>
