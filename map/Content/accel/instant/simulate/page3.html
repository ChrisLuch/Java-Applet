	<p><b>Exercises</b>

	<p>

	<ol>

	<li><u>Constant Acceleration</u>.  Select the following check boxes:
	Car, Pos Path, Velocity Vector, Accel #2.  Leave the other check
	boxes unselected.

		<p>Set the initial velocity to a direction upward and to the right.
		Then drag the car to the lower left-hand corner of the applet
		window.  Then click in the Acceleration Dial at a 6 o'clock point
		and hold the mouse steady with the mouse button depressed so that
		you are creating a motion with constant downward acceleration.  The
		car's path should be parabolic and look like a projectile-motion
		path without air resistance.</p>

		<p>Click the REPLAY button and select Vel Path.  A line in magenta
		will be shown indicating the path of the tip of the velocity
		vector.  Now click PLAY and observe how the car follows the blue
		path in position path while simultaneously the tip of the velocity
		vector follows its path.  The acceleration vector points along the
		velocity path at all times, just like the velocity vector points
		along the position path (i.e., along the instantaneous tangent to
		the position path) at all times.  Use the STEP button to step
		through the motion rather than viewing the motion continuously.</p>

		<p>Click REPLAY again, but this time select the Velocity Space
		check box.  Then click PLAY.  The motion will be shown with the
		origin of velocity space (where the tail end of the velocity vector
		is) and the magenta velocity path at rest.  Observe again how the
		tip of the velocity vector is moving along the straight velocity
		path (straight because the acceleration is constant).  This time
		the blue position path is shown moving relative to the window
		because the car is held fixed at the origin of velocity space.
		Only the car's orientation is changing.  If you now unselect the
		CAR checkbox, you can concentrate better on the changes in the
		velocity vector.</p>

		<p>Repeat this experiment, but now check the Position Vector check
		box.  The position vector will be shown in cyan.  Do this first
		with the Velocity Space check box unchecked, i.e., in Position
		Space view.  You may have to drag the screen so that all of the
		path is in view.  Then repeat this in Velocity Sapce view.  Observe
		that the velocity vector points in the direction of motion of the
		tip of the position vector and is tangential to the blue position
		path and that the acceleration vector points in the direction of
		motion of the tip of the velocity vector and is tangential to the
		magenta velocity path.</p>

		<p>To study this motion quantitatively, select either Data #1 or
		Data #2.  The data should correspond to the familiar equations for
		motions with constant acceleration.</p>

		<p>Unselect the Velocity Space check box and select the Grid and
		Data #2 check boxes.  Stop the replayed motion at some point with
		the PAUSE button, and compare the x,y coordinates printed out with
		the coordinates at the tip of the position vector.  Then, with the
		control button depressed, click somewhere in the applet window and
		drag.  This will change the coordinate system including the origin.
		Notice the change in the position vector and again compare the
		coordinates of the tip of the position vector shown in the data
		display and exhibited graphically in the grid.</p>

		<p>Repeat the motion for different position space origins.  Observe
		that although the position vector is different every time, the
		velocity and acceleration vectors are unaffected by these changes
		in position vector.</p>

		<p>Repeat all of the above with a constant acceleration in a
		different direction and with different intial velocities.</li>
