    <div class="title">Activities on Acceleration</div>

    <p>The first set of four Activities is for constant acceleration.

    <p><ol>

    <li><u>Constant Acceleration</u>.  Display the velocity vector by
    checking the relevant checkbox in the Vector Panel. Also display
    the car's path (Position button).  Make no other changes to the
    applet's default settings.

    <p>Set the initial velocity to a direction upward and to the
    right (drag the velocity vector from the center of the car).
    Drag the car to the lower left-hand corner of the applet
    window.  Click in the Acceleration Dial at a 6 o'clock point
    (acceleration vector pointing downward), and hold the mouse
    steady with the mouse button depressed so that you are
    creating a motion with constant downward acceleration.  The
    car's path should be parabolic and look like a
    projectile-motion path without air resistance.</p>

    <p>Click the Rewind button, and display the Velocity Path
    (Velocity button).  A line in magenta will be shown indicating
    the path of the tip of the velocity vector.  Drag the car back
    to a suitable starting position, and Play the motion. Observe
    how the car follows the blue path in position path while
    simultaneously the tip of the velocity vector follows the
    magenta velocity path.

    <p>Click Rewind, and drag the car back to a suitable starting
    position.  Display also the acceleration vector, with its tail
    end attached to the velocity vector (check the Acceleration at
    Velocity checkbox in the Vector Panel).  Play the motion, and
    observe that the acceleration points along the velocity path
    at all times, just like the velocity vector points along the
    position path (i.e., along the instantaneous tangent to the
    position path) at all times.  Also use the STEP button to step
    through the motion rather than viewing the motion
    continuously.</p></li>

    <p><li><u>Constant Acceleration Cont'd</u>.  Continuing from
    Activity 1, click Rewind again, but this time select the
    Velocity Space mode (click Radio button) and hide the car's
    path (deselect Position toggle button).  Play the motion.

    <p>The motion will be shown with the tail end of the velocity
    vector fixed.  Observe how the tip of the velocity vector is
    moving along the straight velocity path (straight because the
    acceleration is constant).  You can hide the car (deselect the
    CAR toggle button) to concentrate better on the changes in the
    velocity vector.</p>

    <p>Repeat this experiment, but now also display the car's path
          in position space (Position button) and the position vector (check
          "Position" in Vector Panel).  The position vector will be
          shown in cyan.  Do this in Position Space mode (click radio
          button).  You can drag the window (click anywhere in the
          window) to bring all of the car's path into view.  Observe
          that the velocity vector points in the direction of motion of
          the tip of the position vector and is tangential to the blue
          position path and that the acceleration vector points in the
          direction of motion of the tip of the velocity vector and is
          tangential to the magenta velocity path.</p>

    <p> Repeat this in Velocity Sapce view.  Hide or display
    individual elements to focus on the remaining elements of the
    simulation.</li>

    <p><li><u>Constant Acceleration Cont'd</u>.  Continuing from
    Activity 2, put the applet into Position Space mode, and study
    the motion quantitatively by using the data in the Data box
    (select Data button).  The data should correspond to the
    familiar equations for motions with constant acceleration.
    There is a link to these equations under Related
    Items.</p></li>

    <p><li><u>Constant Acceleration Cont'd</u>.  Continuing from
    Activity 3, display both the Grid and the Data box.  Play the
    motion, and Pause it at some point.  Check that the
    <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> coordinates in the Data box are those of the
    tip of the position vector.  Then, with the control button
    depressed, click somewhere in the applet window and drag.
    This will change the coordinate system including the origin.
    Observe the change in the position vector, and again compare
    the coordinates of the tip of the position vector shown in the
    data display and exhibited graphically in the grid.  Observe
    that the velocity and acceleration vectors do <b>not</b>
    change.  Play the motion, and observe the three vectors while
    you change the position origin during the motion.</p></li>

    </ol>

    <p>Repeat all of the above with a constant acceleration in a
    different direction and with different initial velocities.

    <p>The following Activities are for non-constant acceleration.

    <p><ol>

    <li><u>Uniform Circular Motion</u>. Try to make the car go around in
    a circle in position space by steering the acceleration with the
    Acceleration Dial.

    <p>Hint: Put the applet into Velocity Space mode, and display the
    following vectors: velocity and acceleration at velocity. Display
    the velocity path, but not the position path.  Set the initial
    velocity vector (magenta) to some non-zero value by clicking on the
    center of the car and dragging. Then start the motion with an
    acceleration perpendicular to the velocity, and keep adjusting the
    acceleration vector so that it stays perpendicular to the velocity
    vector.  This is not easy to do, but try to keep adjusting the
    acceleration as well as you can.  Also, the magnitude of the
    acceleration should stay constant while the direction is changing.

    <p>When the tip of the velocity vector has traced out a circle (or
    nearly a circle) display the position path to check what the car's
    path looks like in position space.  You will probably find that this
    path looks even less circular than the velocity path.  You may want
    to switch to the Position Space mode at this point.  You may need to
    drag the screen during the motion to keep the blue position space
    path in the applet window.</li>

    <p>

    <li><u>From Position to Velocity to Acceleration</u>.  Create a
    motion for the car with the Acceleration Dial, click Rewind, and
    Play the motion.  Observe the following.

    <p><ul>

    <li>Observe the motion with only the position path and velocity
    vector displayed.  Observe that the velocity vector is always
    tangential to the blue position path.  Then display also the
    position vector, and observe that the velocity vector always points
    in the direction in which the tip of the position vector is moving
    and that the magnitude of the velocity vector is a measure of the
    speed with which the tip of the position vector is moving.</li>

    <p>

    <li>Observe the same motion in Velocity Space mode, with only the
    velocity path and acceleration vector (acceleration at velocity)
    displayed.  Observe that the orange acceleration vector is always
    tangential to the magenta velocity path.  Then also display the
    velocity vector, and observe that the acceleration vector always
    points in the direction in which the tip of the velocity vector is
    moving and that the magnitude of the acceleration vector is a
    measure of the rate at which the tip of the velocity vector is moving.

    <p>The lesson to be learned is that acceleration has the same
    relation to velocity as velocity has to position.</li>

    <p>

    <li>Observe the same motion with only the position path and the
    acceleration vector that has its tail end attached to the car
    displayed. Do this in Position Space mode.  Observe that the
    acceleration vector always points to the inside of the car's path
    in position space or at most along the tangential direction, but
    never to the outside of this path.

    <p>Can you explain why this should be so?  Can you create a motion
    in which the acceleration vector, at least momentarily, points along
    the tangent to the car's path in position space?</li>

    </ul>

    <p>

    <li><u>Numerical Observations</u>.  Reset the applet and create a
    some motion with the Acceleration Dial. Click Rewind, and Play and
    Pause the motion.  Display the Data box, and use the data
    to predict the car's position and velocity at the next time
    step.  Check your predictions by moving the motion one step
    forward in time by means of the STEP button.  One time step has a
    duration of 0.04 s.</li>

    <p>

    <li><u>Pendulum Motion</u>.  Try to create the motion of a simple
    pendulum.  The car should move on a circular arc from left to
    right and back to the left.  This is not an easy task.

    <p>Hint: Work out the velocity space path corresponding to the
    motion of a simple pendulum.  Then try to create this path with the
    Acceleration Dial with the applet in Velocity Space mode.  Display
    only the velocity path and the acceleration vector with its tail end
    at the velocity vector. (The velocity vector itself is not
    displayed.)  Use the orange acceleration vector as a guide in
    drawing the magenta velocity path.  Then display the position path
    to check how you have done.  You may want to switch the applet to
    the Position Space mode at this point.</li>
