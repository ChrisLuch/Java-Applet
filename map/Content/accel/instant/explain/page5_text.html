  <div class="title">Acceleration</div>

 <p>The simulation shows Velocity Space, i.e., the space of velocity
 vectors.  The vector shown is a velocity vector whose tail end is
 fixed at the origin of Velocity Space.  Imagine this vector to be the
 velocity of some object.</p>

 <p>You will be able to control the way this velocity vector changes
 by adjusting an acceleration vector in the acceleration dial.</p>

 <p>First <b>set</b> the velocity vector to the initial value you want
 by dragging the tip of the vector.</p>

 <p>Then <b>pick</b> an acceleration by clicking inside the
  acceleration dial.  An acceleration vector will be drawn from the
  center of the dial to the point where you clicked.  The velocity
  vector will be changing accordingly, i.e., its tip will be moving in
  the direction of the acceleration vector at a rate proportional to
  the magnitude of the acceleration vector.  To change the
  acceleration, keep the mouse button depressed and drag the tip of
  the acceleration vector.</p>

  <p>Can you observe that the relationship between the velocity and
  acceleration vectors is exactly like that between the position and
  velocity vectors?  For a review of the latter, go to Velocity/Basic
  Facts/Simulate It.  In fact, just imagine that the labels 'Velocity
  Space' and 'Acceleration Dial' are changed to 'Position Space' and
  'Velocity Dial', respectively, and the present simulation performs
  exactly like the simulation in Velocity/Basic Facts/Simulate It.</p>

  <p><b>Basic Lesson</b></p>

  <blockquote>As the time-rate-of-change of the position vector gives the
  velocity vector, so the time-rate-of-change of the velocity vector
  gives the acceleration vector.</blockquote>

  <p><b>Some details on controlling the applet</b></p>

  <p>While steering the velocity from the acceleration dial: when you
  release the mouse button, the velocity vector's motion will be
  frozen.  Clicking in the acceleration dial again, will resume the
  motion with the new acceleration, as long as the mouse button is
  held down.</p>

  <p>If the velocity vector extends to one of the boundaries of
  velocity space, the motion will be frozen.  You can start it again,
  by changing the acceleration appropriately or by dragging the tip of
  the velocity vector to a new position and then setting the acceleration
  in the acceleration dial.</p>
