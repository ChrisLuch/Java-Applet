<div class="title">(b) Projectile Motion</div>

<p align="left">To start the motion, click anywhere in the simulation
window.  To reset, click a second time.

<p>This motion is called projectile motion.  If you throw a ball into
the air, it will perform approximately the kind of motion that is
simulated here.  (Not exactly, because of air resistance.)

<p>The object performing projectile motion is interacting with the
entire earth while performing this motion.  This is a gravitational
interaction.

<p>The surface of the earth is shown in green at the bottom of the
simulation window.
