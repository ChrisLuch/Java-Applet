<div class="title">Four Motions</div>

<p align="left">
Click in any of the four quadrants on the left and observe the motion
of the object.  You can run several motions at once, by clicking in
several quadrants.

<p>If you click a second time in one quadrant, the simulation in that
quadrant will be reset and you can view the motion again.

<p>In three of the four motions the object is accelerating. There is
only one motion in which the acceleration is zero.  Which motion is that?

<p>Select (a), (b), (c), or (d) below and then click SUBMIT to find out.
