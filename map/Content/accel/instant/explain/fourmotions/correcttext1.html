<div class="title">(d) Constant Velocity Motion</div>

<p>Yes, motion (d) is the motion in which the object is <b>not</b>
accelerating.

<p align="left">To start the motion, click anywhere in the simulation
window.  To reset, click a second time and then click once more to
start the motion again.

<p>The object is moving in a straight line with constant speed.  That
means it is moving with constant velocity.

<p>The acceleration is zero <b>if and only if</b> the velocity is
constant.  When the velocity is changing, either in magnitude or
direction, the acceleration is <b>unequal</b> to zero.
