<div class="title">(d) Constant Velocity Motion</div>

<p>An inertial frame is a frame of reference in which Newton's first
law holds, i.e., it is a frame relative to which an object will move
with constant velocity as long as the object is not interacting with
any other objects.</p>

<p>A frame that is at rest relative to the surface of the earth is
<b>approximately</b> an inertial reference frame; but only approximately,
mainly because the earth is rotating around its axis.</p>

<p>You may ask how it is possible to test that this frame is
(approximately) inertial.  After all, it is not possible to ensure the
condition of no interaction near the surface of the earth.  Near the
surface of the earth, any object will interact gravitationally with
the earth.  

<p>The answer is that one can balance the resulting force of gravity
with other forces.  If the sum of all forces applied to an object is
zero, the object will move with approximately constant velocity
relative to the surface of the earth.</p>
