        <div class="title">Acceleration vs. Velocity</div>

        <p>The applet on Page 2 lets you investigate the relationship between the
        position, velocity, and acceleration vectors in a motion that can be
        controlled through the acceleration vector.

        <p>To start the motion, click in the Acceleration Dial.  Then drag the
        acceleration vector in the Acceleration Dial to control the
        acceleration.

        <p>You can observe that

        <ul>

        <p><li>the velocity vector points in the direction in which the tip of
        the position vector is moving and that the velocity's magnitude
        represents the rate at which this tip is moving and, analogously,
        that</li>

        <p><li>the acceleration vector points in the direction in which the
        tip of the velocity vector is moving and that the acceleration's
        magnitude represents the rate at which that tip is moving.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Currently, no detailed information about the features of the applet
        is available from the applet's Help menu.
