    <div class="title">The Acceleration of a Planet</div>

    <p><ol>

    <li><b>Activitity 1</b>.  When the applet has loaded, check the
    Acceleration checkbox <img src="accelerationcheck.jpg"
    alt="Acceleration Checkbox" align="top"> to display the planet's
    acceleration vector in orange.  Play the motion without changing any
    of the other settings of the applet.  In particular, keep the
    setting of the Eccentricity slider at zero.

    <p>The planet should be moving in a circular orbit with constant
    speed.  Observe that the acceleration is <b>not</b> zero and that it
    points to the sun at all times.  The acceleration is not zero
    because the velocity of the planet is changing direction.</li>

    <p><li><b>Activity 2</b>.  Continuing from Activity 1, click Replay.
    Set the eccentricity to 0.400 and the semi-major axis to 1.3 AU.
    (1 AU = 1 astronomical unit; 1 AU is the average earth-sun
    distance.)

    <p>Play the motion.  The following image shows the planet and its
    acceleration at one instant during the planet's motion around the sun.

    </p>

    <p>Observe that the acceleration is changing both magnitude and
    direction during the planet's revolution around the sun, but that it
    is always directed towards the sun.</li>
