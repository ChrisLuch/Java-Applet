<div class="title">(a) Circular Motion</div>

<p align="left">To start the motion, click anywhere in the simulation
window. To reset, click a second time.   The simulation shows
positions of the object equal time intervals apart.
</p>

<p>Our object (red) is performing circular motion while interacting
with a second object (yellow).

<p>This kind of motion can be observed when a planet (red) is
revolving around the sun (yellow).  The simulation is not to scale.

<p>The red object's acceleration is <b>not</b> zero because the
direction of the object's velocity is changing all the time.  If the
velocity is changing, there is acceleration.

<p>Note that the object's speed is constant in this case.  However,
the acceleration is still unequal to zero because the <b>velocity</b>
is <b>changing</b>.
