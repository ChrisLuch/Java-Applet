<div class="title">(b) Projectile Motion</div>

<p align="left">To start the motion, click anywhere in the simulation
window.  To reset, click a second time.  The simulation shows
positions of the object equal time intervals apart.

<p>This motion is called projectile motion.  If you throw a ball into
the air, it will perform approximately the kind of motion that is
simulated here.  (Not exactly, because of air resistance.)

<p>In this case, the velocity is changing in <b>two</b> ways: both its
magnitude is changing, because the distances between the positions of
the object equal time intervals apart are changing, and the direction of
the velocity is changing.

<p>Whenever the velocity is changing, the acceleration is non-zero.
