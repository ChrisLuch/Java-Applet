<div class="title">(c) Linearly Accelerated Motion</div>

<p align="left">To start the motion, click anywhere in the simulation
window.  To reset, click a second time.   The simulation shows
positions of the object equal time intervals apart.</p>

<p>The direction of the velocity is <b>constant</b> in this case, but
the magnitude of the velocity is <b>not</b>, because the distances
between the positions of the object as it moves down the incline are
increasing.

<p>Thus, this motion has non-zero acceleration because the velocity is not constant.
