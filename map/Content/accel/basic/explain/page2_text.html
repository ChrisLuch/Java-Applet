  <p>Select Button 2 to display the velocity (magenta) and
  acceleration (orange) vectors of the pendulum bob, and then click
  Play <img src="start.gif" align="top">.  If you want to make the
  velocity and acceleration vectors larger, drag the pendulum bob to a
  higher starting position before clicking Play.

  <p>As you can see, the velocity and acceleration vectors are
  changing all the time during the motion and, in general, point in
  different directions at any given instant.</p>

  <p>This session will provide an intuitive, qualitative explanation
  of how velocity and acceleration are related.  Both of them are
  vector quantities, and it is important to understand that
  acceleration is derived from velocity, and not from speed, which is
  a scalar quantity.  This fact is at the core of some essential
  properties of acceleration.</p>

  <p>Let's now go to an exercise on Page 3, asking you to pick the
  unaccelerated motion(s) among four motions.</p>
