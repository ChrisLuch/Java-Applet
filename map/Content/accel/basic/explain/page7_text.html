  <div class="title">Acceleration</div>

  <p><b>Question</b>. What would the motion of the car whose
  accelerations and velocities were simulated on Pages 5 and 6 look
  like in Position Space?  You can observe this motion by checking and
  unchecking appropriate checkboxes:

  <p><ul>

  <li>uncheck Velocity Space</li>

  <li>check Pos Path</li>

  <li>uncheck Vel Path</li>

  <li>uncheck Accel #2</li>

  <li>check Position Vector</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Drag the object to a place in the applet window so that as much
  as possible of the object's blue position path is visible in the
  window.  Click Replay and then Play.  You may want to view the
  motion with the Car checkbox unchecked.

  <p><b>Exercise</b>.  Reset the applet and make the checkbox changes
  indicated above, but uncheck Position Vector.  In addition, uncheck
  the Car checkbox, and check Accel #1.  Make the mass point perform
  projectile motion.

  <p>Hint: Drag the mass point in the lower left-hand corner of the screen,
  set the initial velocity to point upward and to the right, and then
  choose a constant acceleration vector that points straight down.
  
  <p>Observe the way the velocity changes during the motion.</p>

  <p>Replay the motion and observe that the acceleration either points
  to the inside of the mass point's trajectory or along the tangent to the
  trajectory, but never away from the trajectory to the outside of the
  trajectory.  Why not?  

  <p>Try this with other motions besides projectile motion.</p>
