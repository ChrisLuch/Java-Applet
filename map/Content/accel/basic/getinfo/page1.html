    <p>The following definition of acceleration will be for a mass point.
    See Comment 3 at the end about what it means to talk about the
    "acceleration of an extended object".

    <p><b>Definition of acceleration in words</b>:

    <blockquote>Acceleration is the time-rate-of-change of velocity.</blockquote>

    <p><b>Definition of acceleration in symbols</b>:

    <p align="center">
      <img src="AccDefn.gif" alt="Definition of Acceleration">
    </p>

    <p>In this definition, <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a"
    align="bottom"> denotes the acceleration at time <i>t</i> and <img
    src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> the velocity vector of
    the mass point.  The symbol &Delta;<img
    src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> denotes the change in
    velocity between the instant at time <i>t</i> and a later instant at
    time <i>t</i> + &Delta;<i>t</i>,

    <p align="center">
      &Delta;<img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
    align="bottom"> = <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
    align="bottom">(<i>t</i> + &Delta;<i>t</i>) -
    <img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">(<i>t</i>).
    </p>

    <p>The symbol <i>d</i><img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
    align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> is calculus notation for the more explicit
    notation with the limit symbol.  When the notation
    <i>d</i><img src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> is
    used in physics, it is useful to think of <i>d</i><img src="v.gif"
    alt="vector v" align="bottom"> and <i>dt</i> as very small
    quantities and of the symbol <i>d</i><img src="v.gif" alt="vector v"
    align="bottom">/<i>dt</i> as the ratio of these small quantities.

    <p>Acceleration is a vector quantity, arising from ratios that have
    a vector in the numerator and a scalar in the denominator.  The
    direction of the acceleration vector at a given instant is the
    direction in which the tip of the velocity vector is moving at that
    instant if the tail end of the velocity vector is being held fixed.
    (Otherwise, the motion of the tip of the velocity vector would not
    represent changes &Delta;<img src="v.gif"
    alt="vector v" align="bottom"> in the velocity vector, as are needed
    in the definition of acceleration.)  

    <p>With the tail end of the velocity vector held fixed, the tip of
    the vector describes a path.  Let's call it the <i>velocity
    path</i>.  At any given moment, the acceleration vector's direction
    is along the tangent to the velocity path at that instant.  See the
    following illustration which shows the velocity path of a mass point
    in magenta, three velocity vectors (in magenta) corresponding to
    three different instants of time, and the acceleration vectors (in
    orange) at these three instants.

    </p>

    <p>The magnitude of the acceleration is a scalar quantity denoted
    either by <i>a</i> or |<img src="a.gif" alt="vector a"
    align="bottom">|.  It has no special name.

    <p>The SI-unit of acceleration is m/s<sup>2</sup>.

    <p><u>Comment 1</u>.  The ratio &Delta;<img
    src="v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">/<font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> behind the limit operation in the
    definition of acceleration is called <i>average acceleration</i>.
    With this concept, the definition of acceleration can be reworded as
    follows.

    <blockquote>The acceleration at time <i>t</i> is the limit of the
    average acceleration over a time interval extending from time <i>t</i>
    to time <i>t</i> + &Delta;<i>t</i> when <font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>t</i> goes to zero.</blockquote>

    <p><u>Comment 2</u>. When a motion is along a straight line, say,
    the <i>x</i>-axis, most of the time one will be working with the
    <i>x</i>-component <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> of the acceleration instead of
    the vector <img src="a.gif" alt="vector a" align="bottom"> and will
    be referring to <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> as "acceleration" instead of
    "<i>x</i>-component of acceleration", for brevity's sake.  One may even
    drop the subscript <i>x</i> and write just <i>a</i> instead of
    <i>a<sub>x</sub></i>, again for brevity's sake.  However, one should
    explain that <i>a</i> denotes the (<i>x</i>-component of the)
    acceleration, not the magnitude of the acceleration, unless this is
    clear from the context.

    <p><u>Comment 3</u>.  When an extended object is moving, its parts
    may be moving with different accelerations, e.g., the object may be
    rotating or the object may be vibrating.  In such cases, one cannot
    just speak of "the acceleration of the object".

    <p>In many cases, however, it will be possible to assume the object
    to be rigid and non-rotating.  In such cases, all parts of the
    object have the same acceleration and it makes sense to speak of
    <b>the</b> acceleration of the object.  In other cases, e.g., when the
    object is rotating in addition to performing some motion as a whole,
    one will mean the acceleration of the center of mass of the object when
    speaking of the object's acceleration.  This should be made clear,
    however, unless it is clear from the context.

    <p><u>Comment 4</u>.  When a particle is moving in a circle of
    radius <i>r</i> with constant speed <i>v</i> (uniform circular
    motion), the direction of the acceleration is radial, from the
    particle towards the center of the particle's circular orbit, and
    the magnitude of the acceleration is equal to

    <p align="center">
    <i>a</i> = <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>r</i>.
    </p>

    <p>The acceleration vector, as always, is tangential to the velocity
    path, but it is radial to the position path in this case.
