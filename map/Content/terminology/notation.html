   <div class="title"><center>Notation Used In MAP</center></div>

  <p>The system of notation used in MAP is unambiguous, at least
within a given context.  The system achieves this by using different
symbols for different quantities.  It conforms with what you will find
in general physics texts, with some minor differences.  Most of these
differences occur in the context of vectors where many textbooks use
an ambiguous notation in order to simplify the notation.  An
unambiguous notation can indeed get cumbersome when dealing with
vectors in one dimension.  What MAP does in this case is described
under Vector Notation below.

<p>The notation used in MAP is described here in detail for two
special topics: Kinematics and Vectors.  Symbols for physical
quantities from other areas, e.g., <i>E</i><img src="images/small.gif"
alt="space" height="1" width="5"> for energy and <img
src="images/F.gif" alt="vector F" align="bottom"> for force, are
introduced in the context where the quantities arise.

<p><b>Note</b>: "time elapsed" is a time interval and should be
denoted "&Delta;<i>t</i>" in general; however, if one measures the
time elapsed from the moment <i>t</i> = 0, then &Delta;<i>t</i> =

<p><b>Note</b>: there is no special name for the time-rate-of-change

<p>Magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity: <i>g</i>

<p><b>Note</b>: the symbol "<i>g</i>" denotes a <b>positive</b>
quantity, <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>, whether the <i>y</i>-axis is
directed upward or downward.  Also, don't refer to <i>g</i> as
"gravity".  "Gravity" is the general phenomenon.  There is an
"acceleration due to gravity", a "force due to gravity", a "potential
energy due to gravity", etc.  These different concepts should not all
be referred to by the one word "gravity".

<p><a name="Vectors"><div class="sectionheading">Vector Notation</div></a>

<p><b>Generalities</b>

<p>In MAP, vectors are denoted by symbols in boldface, with an arrow
above the symbol, e.g., <img src="images/a.gif" alt="vector a"
align="bottom"> for the acceleration vector.  There are several other
examples in the preceding section Kinematics.

<p>Several recent textbooks use the same notation.  Generally,
textbooks use boldface, but not always with an arrow.  In handwriting,
you should use an arrow or some other device to distinguish vectors
from scalars.

<p>The parenthesis notation
(<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>) denotes a vector <img
src="images/v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> with scalar components
<i>v<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>v<sub>y</sub></i>;

<p>Distinguish between the scalar component <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> and
the vector component <img src="images/v.gif" alt="vector v" 
align="bottom"><sub>x</sub> of a vector <img src="images/v.gif"
alt="vector v" align="bottom">.

<p>The magnitude (absolute value) of a vector <img src="images/v.gif"
alt="vector v" align="bottom"> is denoted by <i>v</i>, i.e., by the
same letter but in plainface and without an arrow above the letter.
Another notation for the magnitude of a vector is |<img
src="images/v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">|.

<p>The notation |<img src="images/v.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom">| for the magnitude of a vector <img src="images/v.gif"
alt="vector v" align="bottom"> can always be used, but there are
examples where the plainface notation without arrow should not be used
because it would lead to an ambiguity.  E.g., the magnitude of the
vector component <img src="images/v.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom"><sub>x</sub> should be denoted |<img src="images/v.gif"
alt="vector v" align="bottom"><sub>x</sub>|, not
<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>, because <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> denotes the scalar
component.  |<img src="images/v.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom"><sub>x</sub>| may differ from <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> by a
sign and should therefore not be denoted by the same symbol.

<p><b>Vectors in one dimension</b>.

<p>In dealing with vectors, one must distinguish between four kinds of
quantitities:

<p><ul>

  <li>vectors</li>

  <li>vector components of vectors</li>

  <li>scalar components of vectors</li>

  <li>magnitudes (absolute values) of vectors</li>

</ul>

<p>In one dimension, the vector component of a vector is identical
with the vector itself.  Therefore, we will not consider it in the
present context of vectors in one dimension.

<p>The following examples describe the MAP notation for vectors in one
dimension for which an <i>x</i>-axis has been defined.  Kinematical
quantities are used to illustrate the general system.

<p>Velocity: <img src="images/v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">

<p>Velocity scalar component: <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>

<p>Speed (magnitude of velocity): <i>v</i> or |<img src="images/v.gif"
alt="vector v" align="bottom">|

<p><b>Simplification of notation and terminology</b>: It is common to
write <i>v</i> instead of <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>; this notation is
ambiguous because <i>v</i> and <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> are not the same;
the speed <i>v</i> is a positive quantity while the velocity component
<i>v<sub>x</sub></i> can be both positive and negative.

<p>In a given context, <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> may always be positive; in
this case, one can safely write <i>v</i> instead of
<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>; however, it would be good to point out such
change in notation.  

<p>Even in a context where <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> can be negative, one
may want to write <i>v</i> instead of <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>, to use
a less cumbersome notation.  This is fine if the change in notation is
clearly pointed out.

<p>The same comments apply to the distinction between <i>a</i> and
<i>a<sub>x</sub></i> in the case of acceleration.

<p>It is common to refer to <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> as "velocity",
rather than "x-component of velocity".  This is fine too if this usage
is pointed out so that it is understood that this is done for
brevity's sake.  Similarly, one refers to <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> as
acceleration rather than <i>x</i>-component of acceleration.

<p>In one dimension, many books use the same notation for a vector,
its scalar component, and its magnitude.  This makes things look
simple, but can be very misleading because even in one dimension these
quantities behave quite differently.  

<p>MAP distinguishes notationally between these three kinds of
quantities if necessary, although doing so may be tedious, but does
follow the simplified notation in which the same symbol <i>v</i> is
used to denote either the vector <img src="images/v.gif" alt="vector
v" align="bottom"> or the vector component <img src="images/v.gif"
align="bottom"><sub>x</sub> or the magnitude |<img src="images/v.gif"
align="bottom">| of the vector if there is no ambiguity in the given
context.  If MAP does so, this is clearly pointed out.  You should
follow the same practice.

<p><b>Sign conventions</b>.

<p>Sign conventions and signs in general can cause a lot of heachache
and be a source of error.  The following comments apply to
one-dimensional motion along an <i>x</i>-axis and will distinguish
between a vector, its scalar component, and its magnitude.

<p>Let's consider velocity as an example.  Strictly speaking, the
velocity vector is neither positive nor negative. Vectors are not
numbers.  In particular, they are not positive or negative, which are
properties of numbers.  Instead, vectors have magnitude and direction.

<p>In contrast to the vector <img src="images/v.gif" align="bottom">,
its <i>x</i>-component <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> <b>is</b> a number and it
therefore makes sense to talk about it being either positive or
negative.

<p>In 1-d, one can establish an isomorphism between vectors and their
scalar components relative to a given <i>x</i>-axis: the vectors can
be in the positive or negative <i>x</i>-direction and their
<i>x</i>-components are correspondingly positive or negative numbers.
This makes it possible to think of the scalar components as the
vectors themselves.  Still, there is an important distinction between
vectors and their scalar components even in one dimension.  See the
following two paragraphs.

<p><b>Two</b> isomorphisms between vectors in one dimension and
numbers are possible, corresponding to the two directions in which the
<i>x</i>-axis can be chosen to point.  For a given vector <img
src="images/v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom">, whether
<i>v<sub>x</sub></i> is positive or negative depends on how the
positive direction of the <i>x</i>-axis is defined.  If the vector
<img src="images/v.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> points in the
positive <i>x</i>-direction, then <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> is positive.
If the direction of the <i>x</i>-axis is reversed, this does
<b>not</b> affect the vector <img src="images/v.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom">, but changes the sign of <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>.

<p>Vectors are absolute geometric quantities representing physical
quantities that don't depend on how we happen to define our coordinate
system.  If a truck has a velocity with which the truck is moving
towards a big tree, then this velocity does not depend on whether we
define the positive <i>x</i>-direction as pointing towards the tree or
away from the tree.  In either case, the velocity is towards the tree.
However, in the former case, <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> will be positive,
while in the latter case <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> will be negative.

<p>In general, in one or more dimensions, the scalar components of
vectors have signs that depend on our choice of axes.  Vectors don't
have signs and don't change if we change the axes.  In working with
components, it is crucial that it is clear in which direction an axis
points.  This may be clear from the context.  Otherwise, it must be
stated.  In the case of vertical motion, sometimes the <i>y</i>-axis
points upward, sometimes downward.  One must state clearly which
direction the <i>y</i>-axis points.  All signs are relative to this
choice.

<p>The sign business is critical in the context of acceleration.  Let us
refer to <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> as "acceleration" and
<i>v<sub>x</sub></i> as "velocity" in the following.

<p>Suppose the positive <i>x</i>-direction is to the right.  Suppose a
truck is moving to the right while slowing down.  In this case, the
velocity vector is pointing in the positive <i>x</i>-direction and the
acceleration vector in the negative <i>x</i>-direction so that the velocity
<i>v<sub>x</sub></i> is positive and the acceleration
<i>a<sub>x</sub></i> negative.

<p>Now suppose we let the positive <i>x</i>-direction be to the left,
while not changing the truck's velocity and acceleration vectors.
Then the truck's velocity <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> is negative and its
acceleration <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> positive.  Thus, the truck has
positive acceleration while slowing down!

<p>Whether an acceleration <i>a<sub>x</sub></i> is positive or
negative does not tell us anything about whether the speed is
increasing or decreasing unless we know how the <i>x</i>-axis is
oriented.

<p><b>Presenting answers about vectors</b>

<p>In general, when the answer to a question calls for a vector, the answer
should be stated in the form:

<p align="center"><img src="images/v.gif" alt="vector v"
align="bottom"> = (magnitude, direction) <img src="images/small.gif"
alt="space" height="1" width="20"> or <img src="images/small.gif"
alt="space" height="1" width="20"> <img src="images/v.gif" alt="vector
v" align="bottom"> = (components)</p>

<p>In one dimension, an answer could be

<p align="center"><img src="images/v.gif" alt="vector v" alt="vector v"
align="bottom"> = 15 m/s in the negative x-direction.</p>

<p>If the question asks for the component, the answer could be in the
form

<p align="center"><i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = -15 m/s</p>

<p>where it should have been made clear at some point in what direction the
<i>x</i>-axis points.

<p>"<i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = -15 m/s" could also be presented as "<i>v</i>
= -15 m/s" if it has been stated clearly that <i>v</i> is being used
for <i>v<sub>x</sub></i> so that <i>v</i> does not denote speed.

<p>In two dimensions, if the answer calls for a vector, the answer can
be given either in the form "(magnitude, direction)" or in the form
"(<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>)" using components.  In
the latter case, the choice of axes must be pointed out.  In the
former case, the way in which the angle is defined must be made clear.
