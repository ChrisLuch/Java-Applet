        <div class="title">Using Terminal Speed to Determine Viscosity</div>

        <p>In the experiment on Page 2, you investigate the motion of
        several ball bearings as they fall in glycerin. The object is to
        examine the motion and to find the viscosity of the fluid. You are
        provided with a variety of steel ball bearings ranging in radius
        from 0.79 mm to 2.37 mm. The bearings are released into the center
        of a cylinder of glycerin using plastic tweezers. The value for the
        coefficient of viscosity of glycerin is approximately 1 N s
        m<sup>-2</sup> (at 20<sup>o</sup>C).
