    <p>
    After working through the material in this session, see the
    explanation of average speed as a weighted average at
    <b>Speed/Average/Explain It/Weighted Average</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The explanation of average speed on the following pages uses the
    applet on the left.  For instructions on how to use the applet see
    Help and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.  An
    additional Lesson on both average speed and average velocity is
    available under Applet Help.
    </p>

    <p>
    You may want to experiment a bit with the applet before going on to
    Page 2.

    <p>
    <b>Exercise</b>. Drag the ball. Estimate the distance traveled by the
    ball using the scales on the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes.  Using the
    values from the average-speed Data box for the distance <i>s</i>
    traveled by the ball and the time <i>t</i> elapsed, calculate the
    ball's average speed.
