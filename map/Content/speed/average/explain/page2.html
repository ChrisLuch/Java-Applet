    <p><b>Caution</b>. The definition of average speed given on Page 2 is
    easy to use.  Nevertheless, it is sometimes tempting to calculate
    average speed differently, namely, by taking it to be equal tothe
    arithmetic mean of the initial and final speed for a given time
    interval.</p>

    <p>This is <b>not</b> a correct way of calculating average speed.</p>

    <p><b>Exercise</b>. Display the average-speed Data box. Position the
    ball somewhere, and release the mouse button.  Click on the ball
    again, but don't immediately drag it while still holding the mouse
    button down.  The clock is already running while the ball's speed is
    still zero.  Then drag the ball to a new position, but don't release
    the mouse button.  Again, the clock keeps running while the ball's
    speed is zero.  Now release the mouse button.</p>

    <p>The average speed Data box will show the average speed to be
    <b>greater</b> than zero.  However, the mean of the initial and final
    speeds is clearly <b>equal</b> to zero, because both of these speeds
    are zero.  The former (non-zero) value is correct because it was
    obtained using the definition of average speed as distance traveled
    divided by time elapsed, but the latter (zero) value is not.</p>
