   There are two tools that are used to aid in the creation of content items
	for the MAP learning environment. The <b>Page Browser</b> is a tool that
	allows for easy navigation between different pages in a content item. The 
	<b>Answer Form</b> is a tool that allows the easy creation of a question 
	with multiple choice, true/false, or numerical entry answers. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The following pages assume that the reader has some basic knowledge about 
	html content creation and directory structures. <b>Especially framesets</b>.

   <b> The Page Browser </b> <br>
	<blockquote>
    <table width = "90%">
     <tr>
	   <td>
	    The <b>Page Browser</b> is a java applet that displays a number of page 
	    buttons and allows the user to navigate between these pages.<br>
		 <br>
		 
		 The Page Browser is capable of dealing with multiple frames on each page, 
		 and with different framesets on different pages. It can also interact with 
		 Java Applets that implement a Java interface called 
		 <a href="../../Classes/javadoc/ca/ucalgary/phas/map/contentNavigator/PageBrowserListener.html" 
		 target="NewWindow">PageBrowserListener</a><br>
		 <br>
		 
		 A number of <a href="pageBrowserExamples.html">examples</a> have been created to
		 guide you through the creation of a Page Browser enabled content item.

   <b> The Answer Form</b> <br>

  </p>

  <br>

  <p>
   <b> Java Plugin </b> <br>
	<blockquote>
	 The <b>Answer Form</b> and 
	 <b>Page Browser</b> applets require the Java
	 Plugin to run. The plugin can be downloaded from 
	 <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/plugin/">Javasoft</a>. <br>
	 To view any of the examples on these pages, you will need to have this plugin 
	 installed on your system. <br>
    <br>

	 The <b>Answer Form</b> and <b>Page Browser</b> applet html files on these 
	 pages have passed through the <b>HTML Converter</b>. Information about the HTML 
	 Converter can be found from
	 <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/plugin/1.3/docs/html_converter.html">Javasoft</a>.<br>

	 The HTML Converter edits an html file containing an APPLET tag. It comments 
	 out the original tag, and creates an EMBED tag for Netscape, and an OBJECT tag
	 for Internet Explorer. It also strips out any comments that are in the original 
	 applet tag. <br>
    <br>

	 The easiest way to make changes to files that have been run through the HTML Converter 
	 is to remove all the extra tags put in by the converter, leaving only the 
	 original APPLET tag which is commented out. Uncomment the original APPLET tag, 
	 edit it as needed, and re-run the Converter on the file. <br>
	 <br>

	 In these pages the exerpts and descriptions are based on pre-converted files. 
	 So don't be confused when there is only an APPLET tag to deal with.<br>
