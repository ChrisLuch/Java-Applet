  <p>
    The three parts of CANU, the Arranger, the Navigator, and the
    Administrator, can be accessed from the home page of the CANU
    system at http://canu.ucalgary.ca/instructors/ via the Start
    buttons shown in Figure 1 below.
  </p>	 
  <p align="center">

  <p align="center">	 
    <b>Figure 1</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    To launch the Arranger, click its Start button.  The dialog shown
    in Figure 2 below will open prompting you to supply your login
    name and password.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="ArrangerLogin.gif" alt="Arranger Login">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 2</b>
  </p>
  <p>
	 After clicking the 'Ok' button, the Arranger window with its three
    menus, titled 'Course', 'Content', and 'Window', and the toolbar
    open up.  The menus and the toolbar are illustrated in Figure 3
    below.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="ArrangerMenus.gif" alt="Arranger Menus">

  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 3</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The toolbar provides shortcuts to many menu functions, but not to
    all of them.  At this point you may want to explore what is
    available on the toolbar by pointing the mouse to an icon on the
    toolbar and reading the tooltip that pops up.  Try to find the
    same function on one of the three menus.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us go no further, but log out of the Arranger.  You should log
    out whenever you are finished working with the Arranger.  You
    should not just close the Arranger window.  To log out, pull down
    the Course menu, illustrated in Figure 4 below, and select Logout
    at the bottom of the menu.

    <div class="sectionheading">2. Opening and closing a course</div>

  <p>
    Now let's go one step further than in the previous section.  You
    have logged into the Arranger and want to open a course.  To do
    so, pull down the Course Menu illustrated in Fig. 4 above and
    select 'Open...', the second item on the menu.  Alternatively, you
    can select the corresponding icon <img src="OpenCourseTool.gif"
    alt="Open Course Tool" align="top"> from the toolbar.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will be shown a listing of all courses to which you have been
    given access by the Adminstrator.  If you have not yet created a
    course yourself, only the two courses MAP and DEMO may be listed,
    as in Fig. 5 below.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="OpenCourse.gif" alt="Open Course">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 5</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    In Figure 5, the course MAP is shown selected.  A brief
    description of the selected course is in the field on the right.
    If you want to select the course DEMO instead, click on 'DEMO'.
  </p>
  <p>
	 In the case illustrated, only two of the buttons at the bottom of
    the dialog are active: 'Open Read Only' and 'Cancel'.  The 'Open'
    button is inactive because you do not have editing priviledges for
    the selected course.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you click 'Cancel', the dialog will close and you can do
    something else, e.g., create a new course.  Let's not do this
    right now and click 'Open Read Only' instead.  The content of the
    course MAP will be displayed as in Fig. 6 below.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="OpenMAP.gif" alt="Open MAP">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 6</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    You can inspect all aspects of the course (for details on how to
    do this see the following section), copy parts of the course to
    another course, and even make changes to the course, but the
    system will not allow you to save these changes.

    <div class="sectionheading">3. Adding a new course</div>

  <p>
    To create a new course, select 'New Course' from the Course Menu.
    Alternatively, you can select the corresponding icon <img
    src="NewCourseTool.gif" alt="New Course Tool" align="top"> from
    the toolbar. For an alternate way to create a new course see the
    'General Comment' at the end of this section.
  </p>
  <p>
    A 'Course Editor' dialog as in Fig. 7 below will open up.  Complete
    it, and click 'Okay'.  Note, however, that once you have clicked
    'Okay' and the course has been added to CANU, you cannot use the
    Arranger to change the name of the course or delete the course
    from CANU.  This can be done only with the Administrator.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="NewCourseDialog.gif" alt="New Course Dialog">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 7</b>
  </p>
  <p>
	 The name of the course must be between 1 and 18 characters in
    length, with spaces counting as characters.  The 'Course Name'
    text field is the only one that needs to have something in it.  All
    other text fields may be left blank.  The text fields apart from
    'Course Name' have the following significance.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
	   <li>
        <u>Description</u>: The text in this field is displayed next
        to the name of the course in dialogs listing the courses
        available.
		</li>
		<li>
        <u>Base URL</u>: If the URL's of much of the web-based content
        that you want to use in the course all have the same stem, you
        may want to designate this stem as your Base URL.  This can
        save you a lot of typing.  For a realistic example, see the
        Base URL for the course MAP.
      </li>
		<li>
        <u>Student Password</u>: You can choose to protect your course
        with a password which students would be required to use to
        access the course with the Navigator.  You can enter a
        password in the 'Student Password' text field and click the
        'Use Student Password' checkbox if you want to require the
        password.
		</li>
		<li>
        <u>Prevent Student Access</u>: When this checkbox is clicked,
        the name of the course will not be displayed when selecting
        Open Course from the Content menu of the Navigator.  Clicking
        this checkbox can be useful while a course is still being
        developed.  
      </li> 
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    After clicking 'Okay' in the Course Editor dialog, the dialog is
    replaced by the window for the new course.  The Arranger window
    displays the windows for the two courses that are now open, MAP
    and Physics 101, in <i>cascade</i> format, as illustrated in Fig.8
    below.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="NewCourseWindow.gif" alt="New Course Window">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 8</b>
  </p>
  <p>
	 You can change the display to a <i>tile</i> format by selecting
    'Tile Windows' from the Windows menu.  The resulting display,
    illustrated with the courses MAP and Physics 101, is shown in
    Fig. 9 below.

  <p>
    Use the Window menu to switch back and forth between the cascade
    and tile formats.  
  </p>
  </p>
	 You can do several other things with a course window.  You can
	 minimize it by clicking the left-most of the three icons <img
	 src="WindowOperations.gif" alt="Window Operations" align="top"> in
	 the window's top right corner.  Click in the minimized window to
	 restore the window's original size.  You can maximize the window
	 by clicking the middle one of the three icons and can restore the
	 window's original size by clicking the same icon again.  You can
	 close the window and the course by clicking the right-most of the
	 three icons.  The same can be done by selecting 'Close Course'
	 from the Course menu.  (More on closing a course in the following
	 paragraph.)  You can move a course window by dragging it by the
	 window's title bar.  You can resize a course window by dragging
	 the window's lower right-hand corner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before logging out of the Arranger, you must close all courses
    that you have open.  To do so, choose 'Close Course' from the
    Course menu.  If you made changes to a course, you can save these
    before closing the course by choosing 'Save' from the Course menu.
    Alternatively, you can click the Save icon <img src="Save.gif"
    alt="Save" align="top"> on the toolbar.  If you forget to save
    your changes, you will be prompted to save them when closing the
    course and at this time you have the option <b>not</b> to save the
    changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Window menu currently contains a 'Switch to Frame' function.
    Selecting this causes the Arranger window to be displayed in a new
    frame that is resizable by dragging its lower right-hand corner.
    One can revert to the original frame by selecting 'Switch to
    Applet' from the Window menu.  This feature is no longer important
    because the entire CANU window is now resizable (by dragging its
    lower right-hand corner).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Warning</b>.  While the 'Course Editor' dialog illustrated in
    Fig. 7 above is open, the Navigator is frozen.  You must close the
    dialog by either clicking 'Okay' or 'Cancel' to be able to use the
    Navigator again.  The same is true if any of the other Arranger
    dialogs are open, e.g., the 'Create New Concept' and 'Create New
    Instruction Item' dialogs illustrated in Figs. 13 and 15,
    respectively.  The Navigator is not frozen if run in another
    browser, either on the same or another computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>General Comment</b>.  You may want to create a new course by
    copying an existing course, e.g., the course MAP, deleting the
    parts from it that you don't need and adding new parts.  Copying a
    course and renaming it requires the Adminstrator.  It cannot be
    done with the Arranger.

    <a name="AddingContent"></a>

    <div class="sectionheading">4. Adding content to a course</div>

  <p>
    Let us continue at the point illustrated in Figure 9 in the
    preceding section.  Two courses are open in the Arranger, MAP and
    the new course Physics 101, but Physics 101 does not yet have any
    content.
  </p>
  <p>
    The easiest way to add content to Physics 101 is to copy and paste
    material from MAP into Physics 101.  Suppose you want to copy the
    entire branch 'Kinematics' from MAP into Physics 101.  This can be
    done in one of two ways.  The quickest way is to click on
    'Kinematics' in MAP, keep the mouse button depressed and drag the
    item into the Physics-101 window so that the mouse pointer comes
    to rest on 'Physics 101', and then release the mouse button.  The
    result is illustrated in Figure 10.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="BranchCopied.gif" alt="Branch Copied">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 10</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Another way to copy and paste 'Kinematics' from MAP into Physics
    101 is by selecting 'Kinematics' in MAP (by clicking on it with
    the mouse), selecting 'Copy' from the Course menu (or clicking the
    corresponding icon <img src="Copy.gif" alt="Copy" align="top"> on
    the toolbar), selecting 'Physics 101' in the Physics-101 window,
    and selecting 'Paste' from the Course menu (or clicking the
    corresponding icon <img src="Paste.gif" alt="Paste" align="top">
    on the toolbar).
  </p>
  <p>
    This copy/paste operation, in one operation, copies the branch
    'Kinematics' with all of its sub-branches and leaves.  To verify
    this, expand the branch 'Kinematics' in MAP by clicking the small
    '+' to the left of the branch name and similarly expand the
    sub-branch 'Constant Acc'n'.  Do the same in the course Physics
    101, and you should obtain the identical branch structure, as
    illustrated in Figure 11 below.  To collapse the expanded
    structure, click on the '-' minus sign that has replaced the
    former '+' sign.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="BranchExpanded.gif" alt="Branch Expanded">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 11</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose you do not want to include in Physics 101 some of the
    material under Kinematics, e.g., the material on Instantaneous,
    Radial, and Tangential Acceleration.  You can delete any of these
    items from Physics 101 by first selecting the item to be deleted
    and then selecting 'Delete' from the Content menu, one item at a
    time.  Instead of Using 'Delete' from the Content menu you can
    click the corresponding icon <img src="Delete.gif" alt="Delete"
    align="top"> on the toolbar.
  </p>
  <p>
    To move a content item up or down relative to the other content
    items of a course, select the item and then select either 'Shift
    Up' or 'Shift Down' from the Content menu.  Alternatively, click on
    the corresponding one of the two icons <img src="UpDown.gif"
    alt="Up or Down" align="top"> on the toolbar.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose that, in addition to copying material from an existing
    course, you want to add to Physics 101 material of your own and
    other web-based material. E.g., you may want to add a message
    titled 'Course Overview' and a link to an exciting website about
    physics research and career paths in physics titled 'Future
    Physics' and collect these two items on a branch titled
    'Introduction'.
  </p>
  <p>
    To add to Physics 101 a branch named 'Introduction', select
    'Physics 101' in the Physics-101 course window.  Then, from the
    Content menu, select 'New'.  A secondary menu will open up with
    the three choices 'Concept', 'Instruction Item', and 'Question
    Item' as shown in Figure 12 below.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="NewConceptChoice.gif" alt="New Concept Choice">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 12</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Select 'Concept'.  Alternatively, you can select the corresponding
    icon <img src="Concept.gif" alt="Concept" align="top"> from the
    toolbar.  This will open up the 'Create New Concept' dialog shown
    in Fig. 13 below.  Note that branches are called 'concepts' in
    CANU because MAP emphasizes concepts so that many branches of the
    course MAP carry the name of a concept.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="NewConceptDialog.gif" alt="New Concept Dialog">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 13</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    You need to fill in the 'Concept Name' text field (1 - 18
    characters).  If you fill in the 'Description' field, a
    corresponding tooltip will appear when the mouse is over the
    button for the concept in the Navigator.  If you check the
    'Prevent student access' box, the concept will appear in grey
    rather than green both in the Navigator and the Arranger and
    students cannot access it.  If you check the 'Hide from student'
    box, the concept will not be shown at all in the Navigator and
    will appear in pale green in the Arranger.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 'Related Topics' tab lets you link the concept to the
    Navigator's search engine's list of items and lets you add the
    concept to the list if it is not already there.  More on this in
    the later section 'Related Topics and Related Items'.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you click 'Okay' in the 'Create New Concept' dialog, the
    concept 'Introduction' gets added to Physics 101 and is displayed
    in the Physics-101 window as shown in Figure 14 below.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="IntroductionAdded.gif" alt="Introduction Added">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 14</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The new branch (concept) is represented by a grey oval icon.  The
    icon is grey, rather than green, because the branch has as yet no
    content.  
  </p>
  <p>
	 Now let us add the two content items mentioned above, "Course
    Overview" and "Future Physics", and put them on the branch
    (concept) "Introduction" already created.  CANU distinguishes
    between two kinds of content items and refers to them as
    "instruction items" and "questions".  "Overview" and "Future
    Physics" are instruction items.  It is clear what questions are
    and instruction items are simply anything else with a web address.
  </p>
  <p>
    To add the instruction item "Overview" to the branch
    "Introduction", select 'Introduction' in the Physics-101 window
    and select 'Instruction Item' from the Content menu, as
    illustrated in Figure 12 above, or click on the corresponding icon
    <img src="Instruction.gif" alt="Instruction Icon" align="top"> on
    the toolbar.  The 'Create New Instruction Item' dialog illustrated
    in Figure 15 below opens up with the 'Descriptive Information' tab
    open.

  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 15</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Fill in the fields on this tab in analogy to what was done with
    the 'Create New Concept' dialog illustrated in Fig. 13 above.
  </p>
  <p>
    When done, <b>don't</b> click 'Okay' at the bottom of the dialog
    yet, but continue with the 'Location of Content' tab of the
    'Create New Instruction Item' dialog.  This is the second tab from
    the left.  If you click on it, the window will change to that
    shown in Figure 16.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="Item1Location.gif" alt="Location Tab for Item 'Course Overview'">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 16</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    This tab lets you enter the URL for the 'Course Overview' page.
    Suppose the page has the URL
    'http://myserver.uqualicum.ca/tutorials/physics101overview.html'.
    Compare this to the Base URL for Physics 101 which was chosen
    earlier (see Fig. 7) as http://myserver.uqualicum.ca/tutorials/.
    With the 'Use Base URL' checkbox checked, you only need to add the
    remainder 'physics101overview.html' of the item's URL in the
    page-1 textfield.  If the 'Use Base URL' checkbox were not
    checked, you would need to add the item's entire URL
    'http://myserver.uqualicum.ca/tutorials/physics101overview.html'
    in the page-1 text field.
  </p>
  <p>
    If an instruction item has more than one page, as is true for the
    one you are reading at present, each page will have to have its
    own URL.  You can enter these URL's by selecting the number of
    pages from the 'Number of Pages' drop down menu on the 'Location
    of Content' tab.  This will open up as many text fields as there
    are pages.  It will also make the buttons under 'Page Navigation'
    at the bottom of the tab active giving you a choice of format for
    the page navigation.  Details on this in the next section 'Editing
    course content'.  The function of the remaining two tabs, 'Related
    Topics' and 'Related Items', is described in the final section.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now click 'Okay' at the bottom of the 'Create New Instruction Item'
    window.  The item 'Course Overview' will be added to the branch
    'Introduction' and displayed as in Fig. 17 below.  Fig. 17 also
    includes the instruction item 'Future Physics'.

    You may wish to have the branch 'Introduction' appear ahead of the
    branch 'Kinematics'.  To move it up, select 'Introduction' and
    click the Move-up icon <img src="Moveup.gif" alt="Move Up"
    align="top"> on the toolbar.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adding the 'Future Physics' instruction item is done just like
    adding the 'Course Overview' item, except for one difference.  The
    'Future Physics' item points to a website located on a different
    server than the one named in the Base URL.  Thus, for this item
    one cannot use the Base URL and must enter the item's entire URL
    in the page-1 text field.  This is illustrated in Fig. 18 below.

    'Course Overview' to Physics 101.  Suppose you want to re-organize
    the material in 'Course Overview' so that it becomes a 3-page
    item.  This can be done as follows.  Since you created Physics
    101, you automatically have editing priviledges for the course.
  </p>	 
  <p>
    Log back into the Arranger, if necessary, and re-open Physics 101.
    Select the item 'Course Overview' and then select 'Edit...' from
    the Content menu or click the Edit icon <img src="Edit.gif"
    alt="Edit" align="top"> on the toolbar.  You can also simply
    double-click on 'Course Overview'.  The 'Edit Selected Instruction
    Item' dialog opens up.  It looks like the 'Create New Instruction
    Item' dialog illustrated in Fig. 15 above.  Click on the 'Location
    of Content' tab, and select '3' from the 'Number of Pages'
    drop-down menu.  Text fields for entering the URL's of the three
    pages will open as illustrated in Fig. 19 below.

    <b>Figure 19</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Enter the URL's for the three pages, and select the page
    navigation format under 'Page Navigation'.  The format used in the
    course MAP is illustrated in Fig. 19.  It is achieved by selecting
    three of the five checkboxes as indicated.  Click 'Okay' if these
    are all the changes you want to make to the item.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Comment</b>.  In entering the three page URL's when editing the
    'Location of Content' tab, you may want to copy/paste the URL from
    the field for page 1 into the fields for pages 2 and 3 and then
    make the minor corrections required in the last two addresses.
    This would work.  However, it is <b>not</b> possible to copy/paste
    a URL (or any text) from outside of the CANU applet into the
    Arranger text fields.  This is a feature of the java security
    protocol.  An applet does not interact with any other applications
    that you may have on your computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can edit the particulars describing a branch (concept) or
    those describing the course Physics 101 just like editing an
    instruction item.  However, as mentioned earlier, you cannot
    change the name 'Physics 101', and you cannot delete the course.
    This can be done only by using the Administrator.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is possible to preview an item while working in the Arranger.
    Suppose you are considering copying a content item from the course
    'MAP' into Physics 101, but are not sure if the item is suitable.
    To preview the item, select it and then select 'View...'  from the
    Content menu or click the View icon <img src="View.gif" alt="View"
    align="top"> on the toolbar.  The item will open up in a separate
    resizable pop-up window.  Close the window before continuing to
    work with the Arranger.

    <div class="sectionheading">6. Adding and editing questions</div>

  <p>
   Suppose you want to add a question about average velocity to
   Physics 101.  As mentioned above, CANU distinguishes between
   'instruction items' and 'questions'.  The logistics of questions
   are different from instruction items because there must be room for
   student input and corresponding system responses.  Therefore, CANU
   provides a separate dialog for creating and editing a question.
  </p>
  <p>
   Physics 101 already contains the MAP material on Kinematics.  So
   let's add a question in this area.  In the Arranger, under
   Kinematics, navigate to Velocity/Average/Test Yourself.  This is
   the branch where questions on average velocity are collected.
   Select 'Test Yourself' and then select 'Question Item' from the
   Content menu under 'New' as illustrated in Fig. 12 above or click
   on the 'New Question' icon <img src="Question.gif" alt="Question"
   align="top"> on the toolbar.  The 'Create New Question' dialog will
   open up with the 'Basic Information' tab open.  See Fig. 20 below.

    <img src="RoundTripQuestion.gif" alt="Round Trip Question">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 20</b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Fill in a question name (1 - 18 characters long), and if you want to
   have a tooltip for the item fill in the 'Description' text field.
   If you click 'Okay' at the bottom of the dialog, the question will
   be added to the course and the Kinematics branch of Physics 101 in
   the Arranger will look as illustrated in Fig. 21 below.
  </p>

  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 21</b>
  </p>
  <p>
   You will need to enter more particulars for the new question, like
   the type of question it is to be.  This is done on the 'Question
   and Responses' tab.  If you click 'Okay' on the 'Create New
   Question' dialog before completing this tab, you can complete the
   tab later.  To do so, select the question, click on the Edit icon
   <img src="Edit.gif" alt="Edit" align="top"> from the toolbar, and
   select the 'Question and Responses' tab.
  </p>
  <p>
   Do this now for the 'Round Trip' question.  Pull down the 'Question
   Type' menu.  The menu offers a choice of four types of questions.
   Depending on which one of the four question types you select, the
   'Question and Responses' tab will present a different set of text
   fields for you to complete.  The text fields for the four question
   types will now be dealt with in turn.  The use of the 'Related
   Topics and 'Related Items' tabs is explained in the final section.

      string.  If you want the answer to completely match a given
      string, click 'Add' under 'Complete Match Responses'.  A button

      'displacement' in Fig. 25.<br> 

		<br> If you check the 'Match Case' box, the match is
      case-sensitive.  E.g., the student answer 'Displacement' will
      not be accepted as a match in this case.<br>

		<br>The slider labeled 'Percent' sets the mark you want to
		assign to a match.  In the present case, you would want this to
		be 100%.  To change the slider setting, either drag the slider
		tab or, for fine-adjustments, click with the mouse to right or
		left of the slider tab. <br>

		<br>If you want to accept more than one string as a correct
		answer, click the 'Add' button again.  A second button with the

		present a text field for entry of another correct string.
		Fig. 26 illustrates this segment of the dialog with the
		alternate answer 'displacment' entered in the text field.  Note,
		however, that the 'Percent' slider is set to only 90% in this
		case because the answer contains a spelling error.

    <div class="sectionheading">7. Related Topics and Related Items
</div>

  <p>
   <b>Related Topics</b>.  The content items and the concepts
   (branches) of a course in CANU can be related to subject areas
   called 'topics' in CANU.  The set of topics for a course forms an
   index that can be searched in the Navigator.  To access the
   'Topics' index select 'Search' from the Navigator's 'Content' menu.
   If you select a topic, the Navigator lists all content items linked
   to this topic and provides direct access to any of these items.
   For more detail, see the User's Guide for the Navigator.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, to relate all questions on average velocity in the
   course Physics 101 to the topic 'Average velocity', start by
   selecting the 'Test Yourself' branch at
   Kinematics/Velocity/Average/Test Yourself/.  See Fig. 21 above.
   Then click on the Edit icon <img src="Edit.gif" alt="Edit"
   align="top"> on the toolbar, and select the 'Related Topics' tab in
   the 'Edit Selected Concept' dialog.  The resulting dialog is
   illustrated in Fig. 27 below.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="RelatedTopics.gif" alt="Related Topics">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 27</b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Scroll through the list under 'Topics already in this Course', and
   check if the list already contains 'Average velocity'.  In the case
   illustrated it does.  Select 'Average velocity' in the list of
   topics and click the 'Add' button.  The topic will appear in the
   field on the right titled 'Topics Related to this Item'.  If you
   made a mistake and do not want 'Average velocity' to be related to
   the given content item, select 'Average velocity' under 'Topics
   Related to this Item' and click the 'Remove' button.
  </p>
  <p>
   If 'Average velocity' is not already listed under 'Topics already
   in this Course', enter it in the text field 'New Topic' and click
   the 'Add Topic' button.  'Average velocity' will be added at the
   end of the listing 'Topics already in this Course', but will appear
   in correct alphabetical order the next time the 'Related Topics'
   dialog is opened up.
  </p>
  <p>
   The steps required to relate an instruction item or a question to a
   topic are analogous to those for a concept (branch) described above.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Related Items</b>. It is possible to link to a given instruction
   item or question to any other such item in the course.  Such linked
   items are listed in a separated area under the title 'Related
   Items' in the bottom left corner of the Navigator window when the
   given instruction item is on display.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, you may want to link to the item
   Kinematics/Velocity/Average/Get Information in Physics 101 to an
   item that gives information on displacement.  To do so, select the
   item Kinematics/Velocity/Average/Get Information in the Arranger
   (the item is displayed but not selected in Fig. 21 above), click
   the Edit icon <img src="Edit.gif" alt="Edit" align="top"> on the
   toolbar, and select the 'Related Items' tab.  The resulting window
   is illustrated in Fig. 28 below.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="RelatedItems.gif" alt="Related Items">
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <b>Figure 28</b>
  </p>
  <p>
	In the directory displayed under 'Available Items' on the left of
   the window, navigate to Kinematics/Displacement/Get Information,
   select the item, and click the 'Add' button.  An additional
   'Reference Name' dialog opens up.  This dialog too is illustrated
   in Fig. 28.
  </p>
  <p>
   In this example, the related item is given the name 'Displacement'.
   This is the name by which the item will be listed under 'Related
   Items' in the Navigator.  Click 'Okay' in the 'Reference Name'
   dialog, and 'Displacement' will be added under 'Current Related
   Items'.  You can add as many related items to the given instruction
   item as you like.  You also can remove such items by selecting them
   and clicking the 'Remove' button.
  </p>
  <p>
   <u>Comment 1</u>.  Related items must be part of the course.  If
   you want to relate a given instruction item to an outside website,
   you can create an instruction item that points to this website and
   then make this new instruction item a related item.
  </p>
  <p>
   <u>Comment 2</u>.  In the course MAP, simulations are often related
   to pages containing suggested activities.  Such pages must be
   present in the course as instruction items before they can be used
   as related items.  You may want these pages to be accessible only
   in the 'Related Items' area of the Navigator when the simulation is
   displayed, but not to be accessible directly.  This can be done by
   checking the 'Hide from student' checkbox (see Fig. 15 above) in
   the 'Create New Instruction Item' or 'Edit Instruction Item'
   dialogs for the activity page.
  </p>
  <p>
   <u>Comment 3 (important)</u>.  When copying an entire branch from a
   course, say, MAP, to another course, say, Physics 101, all links to
   related items are copied as well, <b>as long</b> as the related
   items are on the branch that is being copied.  Links to related
   items on another branch are not copied, even if that branch has
   already been copied earlier.  Therefore, if one wants to copy part
   of a course and maintain all links to related items existing within
   that part, one must not copy this part branch by branch.  A
   successful strategy would be to copy the entire course and then
   delete the parts that are not of interest.
  </p>  
  <p>
   You <b>cannot</b> use the Arranger to copy an entire course.
   Courses can be copied only by using the Adminstrator.  You will
   want to give a new name to the copy of a course.  That too can be
   done only with the Administrator.
