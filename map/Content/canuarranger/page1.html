  <p>
    The CANU Arranger (to be referred to in the following as
    <i>Arranger</i>) allows an instructor to create a course on CANU
    and arrange its content in tree-like fashion.  The instructor can
    name the branches of the course tree and the leaves at the ends of
    the branches.  A leaf must point to a file that resides on a web
    server and is identified by a URL.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Arranger does <b>not</b> help with the design of the files to
    which a course points.  The creation of files (applets, html
    documents, etc.) is a separate task for which a variety of
    independent tools are available.  The Arranger allows setting up
    questions in several formats, multiple-choice, numerical-value,
    and fill-in-the-blank, but does not help with the creation of the
    question and response pages themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to be able to use the Arranger, please get in touch with
    Hans Laue (email: hlaue@ucalgary.ca) who can sign you on as an
    instructor with login name and password.
  </p>
  <p>
    A User's Guide to the Arranger is available on Page 2.  It is
    divided into sections listed in a Table of Contents.
  </p>
  <p>
    The User's Guide cannot be printed out directly from the CANU
    Navigator, because of java security restrictions.  You can view
    the Guide separately at
    http://canu.ucalgary.ca/canuarranger.html and print it out
    from there.
