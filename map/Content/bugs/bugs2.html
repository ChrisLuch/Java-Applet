		  <li>The '2.00Kg' label on the block sitting on the springs
		  should be changed to '2.00 kg', i.e., a lower case 'k' and a
		  space between the numerical value and the unit.</li>

		  <li>The color of the weight vector should be changed from blue
		  to green, to conform to our regular color scheme.</li>

		  <li>It would be good if there were more variation in spring
		  length from most compressed to least compressed, so that it is
		  more eye-catching that the length of the springs is variable.
		  Can this be done easily?  At least to double the range through
		  which the length of the springs is varied?</li>

		  Show different fbd's in the Lab Frame and Object Frame modes

        Force/Explain It</a></p>

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->
        <p>Details:<br> In the Lab Frame mode, place the tail end of
        the acceleration vector on the table top near the right edge
        of the table.  When the table gets dragged up and down, this
        tail end will have to be dragged along.  Also, when the tip of
        the acceleration vector gets dragged (or the acceleration
        slider is used), the table top is moving on the screen and the
        tail end of the acceleration vector will have to move with it.
        During the animation, the acceleration vector will move
        rigidly with the table top to suggest that the acceleration
        vector is a property of the table.</p>

		  <p>In the Object Frame mode, place the acceleration vector
		  exactly where it is now, but change its label from a lower
		  case <b>a</b> to an upper case <b>A</b>.  In this frame, the
		  acceleration shown will represent the acceleration of the
		  Object Frame relative to the Lab frame, not the acceleration
		  of the table.  The latter is zero in this frame.</p>

		  <p>Also, in the Object Frame mode, add a third vector to the
		  fbd.  The third vector is drawn in black and labeled
		  <i>F<sub>fict</sub></i> = ... N.  The dots will be replaced by
		  the value of the magnitude of this fictitious force.  This
		  value is equal to ma, where m = 2 and a is equal to the
		  magnitude of the acceleration (between 0 and 4).  The
		  direction of the black arrow is always opposite to that of the
		  acceleration.  Thus, when the acceleration is up, the
		  fictitious force will side-by-side with the weight in the fbd,
		  and when the acceleration is down, the fictitious force will
		  be side-by-side with the normal force in the fbd.  To not show
		  the force vectors on top of each other, show force vectors
		  that point in the same direction slightly offset from each
		  other horizontally.  I suggest to have the tail ends of two
		  such vectors roughly at the left and right edges of the black
		  dot representing the object in the fbd.  Also put the label of
		  the new fictitious force arrow below and to the right of the
		  tip when the arrow is up and above and to the right of the tip
		  when the arrow is down.  That way it won't overlap with the
		  label of the other force.</p>

		  href="http://brahe.phys.ualberta.ca/~alphy/meltp/edit_content/Applets/forces/AccelIncline/AccelInclineJARHTML.html">Accelerating Incline</a>

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->
        <p>Details:<br>

		  <ol>

		  <li>In addition to the three force vectors (normal, weight,
		  friction), allow for display of the three acceleration vectors:

		  <ul>

		  <li>the acceleration <b>a</b> of the block relative to the lab</li>

		  <li>the acceleration <b>a'</b> of the block relative to the incline</li>

		  <li>the acceleration <b>A</b> of the incline relative to the lab</li>

		  </ul>

        <p>The three acceleration vectors must add vectorially so that
        <b>a</b> = <b>a'</b> + <b>A</b>.  <b>A</b> is determined by
        one of the sliders, the other two accelerations must be
        present in the code somehow and are calculated from things
        like the angle of the incline and the other variables
        affecting the motion.</p>

		  <p>Actually, we should display not the accelerations
		  themselves but the mass of the block times these
		  accelerations.  (At present the mass of the block is set to 1
		  kg, so the product ma is numerically equal to just a.  Thus,
		  all we have to do is display the acceleration vectors but
		  label them 'm<b>a</b>' instead of <b>a</b>, etc.  The reason
		  for being interested in m<b>a</b> rather than <b>a</b> is that
		  m<b>a</b> is equal to the net force, so that by dragging
		  m<b>a</b> into the force diagram one can demonstrate that
		  Newton's second law is obeyed.</p>

		  <p>Which ones of the three accelerations are going to be
		  displayed at any given time, and which ones of the three force
		  vectors, will be determined by a pull-down selection tool that
		  is going to replace the present pull-down menu accessible in
		  the lower right-hand corner.  This selection tool will also
		  allow any vectors that have been checked to be moved together
		  as a block.  The present "FBD" check box will become redundant
		  as a result.</p>

		  <p>In its default state, the vector <b>A</b> is drawn inside
		  the incline (or near it if the angle is very small) and the
		  other two acceleration vectors are drawn with their tail ends
		  at the center of the block.  When the system is moving, these
		  acceleration vectors move along with the incline and the 
		  block.</p>

		  <p>We need to decide on three different colors for the three
		  accelerations.  <b>a</b> should be the standard orange for
		  acceleration, but the two other accelerations should be
		  slightly different.  There are also the colors of the
		  components to decide on.  See below.</p>

		  </li>

		  <p>

		  <li>The display/hide/move of force vectors will be handled
		  together with the display/hide/move of acceleration vectors
		  with a Photoshop-like selection device that can be accessed
		  via the icon in the lower right-hand corner.</li>

		  <p>

		  <li>The present 'Fix FBD' check box and its functionality
		  should be extended to a 'Fix Vectors' check box that will fix
		  all vectors, forces and accelerations, onto the incline and
		  block.  That means that when this check box is selected, the
		  pull-down menu should not allow the force vectors to be moved,
		  but should continue to allow individual force vectors to be
		  hidden or displayed. Thus, this menu has to stay accessible
		  when this box is checked, which is not the case at present.
		  When the box gets checked, vectors that are scattered all over
		  the window have to be placed in their standard positions on
		  the incline and block.</li>


		  <p>

		  <li>The FBD Components check box should be replaced by a more
		  general Components check box.  When that is checked, the
		  Photoshop pull-down menu has a different functionality: it
		  looks the same as when the Components check box is unchecked,
		  but the items checked in the pull-down menu now affect the
		  components of the vectors.  Thus, if an acceleration vector is
		  checked to be displayed, then its components will now be
		  displayed.  This will be in addition to whatever vectors are
		  already on the screen.  The components will be shown with
		  their tail ends at the tail end of the vector. Then, when the
		  Component check box gets unchecked, the pull-down menu will
		  affect the vectors and leave undisturbed whatever components
		  may be on the screen.</p>

		  <p>There have to be two kinds of components displayable,
		  components relative to x,y axes that are horizontal and
		  vertical and componnents relative to x',y' axes that are down
		  the incline and perpendicular to the incline, respectively.
		  That choice can perhaps be set by means of a button on the
		  Photoshop pull-down menu.  There also has to be a facility to
		  only affect either the x or the y components, i.e., one must
		  be able to move or hide the x-component without affecting the
		  y-component.  Again, maybe this choice could be in the same
		  pull-down menu.</li>

		  <p><li>The FBD check box should be replaced with a check box
		  labeled 'Vectors' that toggles with the 'Components' check
		  box: only one of them can be selected at a time.  When the
		  Vectors check box is selected the Components check box gets
		  unselected automatically and the pull-down menu lets you work
		  on the vectors.  Similarly, when the Components check box gets
		  selected.  The other three check boxes will be the Fix Vectors
		  and the present Ramp and Block.</li>

		  <p><li>The layout of the control panels should be changed.  At
		  the top there is only the logo bar, the action window is in
		  the middle, and at the bottom are all the controls.  Can the
		  angle, acceleration and mu values not be displayed with the
		  sliders, thus saving some vertical space and having a more
		  direct display of these values?  If the row of check boxes is
		  placed directly above the final row of buttons, then Ramp and
		  Block should come first in this row, and the Vectors and
		  Components check boxes last, so that they are placed next to
		  the button for the pull-down menu.</li>

		  <p>

		  <li>There will have to be some other adjustments so that the
		  weight vector is visible in its entirety under all conditions.</li>

        <p>
         In both the sine and trigonometric applets, the vertical
         dotted line in the unit circle is covered by the solid red
         color when the line is inside the angle.  The same is not
         true for the horizontal dotted line showing the cosine.  

			<p>This is not a problem when one goes around the circle a few
			times and the solid color has changed to something other than
			red.  At some point there will then be a problem with the
			blue cosine line being masked by the blue background of the
			angle.

			<p>I suggest the following resolution.  In the range from -10 pi
			to 10 pi, show the vertical stippled line representing the
			sine in black WHEN it falls inside the solid color of the
			angle. Show it in red, even if the angle is in this range
			when the vertical line is on a white background.  Use a black
			dotted line both in the circle on the left and in the graph
			on the right.  Outside of this angular range, show the
			vertical line always as red because there it is clearly
			visible against the background.  Repeat this procedure when
			the angle gets so large that it again is in the red color
			range.
			<p><b>I have simply colored the inside of the unit circle with white all the time. &nbsp;That way
			both lines are visible all the time. &nbsp;Is this acceptable?<br>
			(2001.06.20) Jeremiah</b>

			<p>For the cosine, let's not worry about this because for angles
			near 0, the blue stippled line is clearly visible and by the
			time students get to the blue angles they will know what is
			going on.

		   Interchange the order of the button sets labeled 'Functions'

		  Put the button set labeled 'Vertical Lines' on the left (where
		  'Functions' is now) and put 'Functions' on the right (where
		  Vertical Lines is now).  Relabel the two button sets as
		  indicated above.  Reasons are as follows.

		  <p>'Projections' belongs with the circle on the left and 'Graphs'
		  with the graphs on the right.  So the button sets will be more
		  intuitive to use this way.  The new names reflect better the

        <p>
		  Details:<br>
        The slider titled "sun's velocity", which is to become
        "planet's velocity" shows the wrong velocity velocity values.
        Instead of 1 km/s it show something close to 1.96 km/s.  In
        other words, the slider is using an incorrect scale factor.
        The velocity vectors add correctly and, if the scale change is
        made on the slider the printed velociy values aer correct as
        well.  FIXED.</p>

        <p>The editorial things that need to be taken care of are:

        <ul>

        <li>Change the fourth one of the printed values from "v =" to
        "velocity (v):", where "v" should be in boldface with an arrow
        on top.  Write unit as "km/s" instead of "km".  FIXED.</li>

        <li>For the check box labels "probe rel' stars" add "(v)"
        behind "stars" and for "probe rel' planet" add "(v')" behind
        "planet".  Both "v" and "v'" are vector symbols and should be
        displayed as in the previous bullet.  Make room for the extra
        symbols by reducing the slider's width.  OPEN.</li>

        <li>The RESET button should have a different action from the
        REPLAY button.  It should set the velocity slider to zero and
        should unselect all buttons, like the trace and velocity
        buttons.  It does not do these things right now, only resets
        the probe to its initial position, which is what the REPLAY
        button does.  OPEN.</li>

        </font> <!-- brief description --> <p>Update the INFO page for
        the Rolling Motion applet (formerly called 'Cycloid').  Also,
        link the Info page to the MAP logo pull-down menu.  Picture
        the spool when it is in a different phase.  Add a toggle
        button that either will display or hide the numerical data. In
        the default state, the data will be hidden.  The values for
        the coordinates of the center of the spool are incorrect.  It
        looks as if the values shown are in pixels.  They should be in
        meters.

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->
        <p>Details:<br> The applet has been updated so that there is
        no longer a button with a question mark providing HELP, but
        the present info page still lists this button as Item 6.  The
        present Item 6 should be deleted from the Info page and the
        numbers of the following items should all be moved to fill the
        gap.</p>

		  <p>I have already edited the text of the Info page.  In
		  particular, I have deleted the item in the list that referred
		  to Help.  So, please start where I left off.</p>

		  <p>Also, I would suggest you do not give your email address
		  here.  It can become outdated (the present address already
		  is?).</p>

		  <p>Try to use a picture of the applet in which the velocity
		  vectors are somewhat larger and there is minimal overlap of
		  labels and vectors.</p>

		  <p>The Info page is not connected to the pull-down menu at present.</p>

		  For the slider labels, replace 'Angular Velocity:' by

		  the labels 'Orientation' and 'Velocity Vectors'.</p>

		  <p>On the drop-down menu, spell 'all' as 'All' and 'none' as

		  <p>Make the following label changes in the drop-down menu:</p>

		  <p>'Cycloid point in lab frame' to 'Spool point in lab frame'<br>

       RFE 2001.09.20.001 STATUS: OPEN

        </font> <!-- brief description --> <p>To SHM applet, add also
		  a display of the velocity and the acceleration.  (So far we
		  have only discussed the display of the position of the
		  oscillator.)  Do this only for the undamped oscillator, not
		  for the damped oscillator.</p>

        <!-- the url that this rfe or bug relates to (might be multiple urls here)-->
		  <p>url: does not exist, new applet presently under construction</p>

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->

        <p>Details:</p> 

		  <p>Do something like what Andrew did with his
		  Acceleration/Instantaneous/Simulate It applet, and create a
		  bunch of check boxes that let you either display or hide
		  certain features.</p>

		  <p>
		  <ol>

		  <li>There are three elements to the display: the circular
		  motion on the left, the up-and-down shm in the middle, and the
		  graphical representation of the middle motion on the right.
		  Create checkboxes for all three, so that any one, or two, or
		  three can be viewed at one time.</li>

		  <p>

		  <li>Add a checkbox that lets you view the velocity, again in
		  the three display modes.  On the left, the velocity vector is
		  tangential to the circle and points in the direction of
		  motion.  Its magnitude is equal to rw, where 'r' is the radius
		  of the circle (amplitude of the shm) and 'w' (Greek letter
		  omega) is the angular frequency.  (This w is equal to
		  w<sub>0</sub> in the damped motion.)  Choose a suitable scale
		  for the velocity vector so that for the range of w possible,
		  the magnitude of rw is not going to exceed the size of the
		  screen.

		  <p>Allow the user to view the velocity vector on the left in
		  two different ways: attached to the revolving point and
		  attached to the center of the circle.  (Andrew has something
		  like this for his acceleration: accel 1 and accel 2.)  In the
		  mode where the velocity vector has its tail end attached to
		  the center of the circle, only in that view, allow the
		  graphical display of the velocity.  Reason: the vertical
		  coordinate of the graph is the projection of the velocity
		  vector that is attached at the center of the circle.</p>

		  <p>However, in the middle view (shm) display the velocity in
		  either view 1 or view 2.  In one case there will be a vertical
		  velocity vector attached to the oscillating block (this vector
		  is a projection of the vector revolving with the point), in
		  the other case there will be a vertical velocity vector
		  attached to the equilibrium position of the shm.</p></li>

		  <p>

		  <li>Do something similar for acceleration as for velocity.
		  When the velocity vector is attached to the origin, its tip
		  traces out a circle on the left.  Draw this circle in magenta.
		  When the acceleration check box is ticked (accel 1) attach an
		  acceleration vector to the tip of the revolving velocity
		  vector.  This acceleration vector points in the direction of
		  motion of the tip and has a magnitude rw<sup>2</sup>.  Choose
		  a reasonable scale for this vector.  Also allow display of a
		  second acceleration vector (upon checking a box) that has its
		  tail end attached to the center of the circle.  This
		  acceleration vector points opposite to the position vector.

		  <p>Again, allow checking of projections of these two
		  acceleration vectors for the middle view and the graphical
		  view as for velocity.</li>

		  <p>

		  <li>Color everything as usual: cyan, magenta, orange for
		  position, velocity, acceleration.  This applies to all
		  vectors, traces, and graphs.</li>

		  <p>

		  <li>With a check box, make a data table available that prints
		  out time, position, velocity, acceleration of the shm and is
		  updated continually during the motion. </li>

		  <p>

		  <li>Have PLAY/PAUSE button and Step button.</li>
