		  <!-- status of bug (either OPEN, FIXED, or NOT A BUG) -->
		  <p>
		  Status: FIXED
		  </p>

        <!-- brief description -->
        <p>
		  The Navigator does not add scrollbars to a single page that is
		  too large to fit into the content area.
        </p>

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->
        <p>Details:

        <p>
		  When pages are loaded directly into the content area of the
		  Navigator, not via the pagebrowser system, the Navigator does
		  not add scrollbars so thata part of the page is not readable.
		  This is of concern to the Edmonton people who have content
		  that does not use the pagebrowser, and there may be other
		  users of CANU as well who want to use CANU for all kinds of
		  purposes without the pagebrowser and who will need these
		  scrollbars.

		    This may be a problem with the Arranger, but one notices it

		  The Concept Table should be added to the Location Tracker as an optional navigation mode. The Concept Table would be removed from the Search dialog. The student will be able to choose between "concept map" (the current mode), or "concept tree" mode for navigation of course content. 
        </p>

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->
        <p>Details:
		  It is desirable to have a more compact and efficient navigation scheme for the CANU Arranger. The Concept Table will be provided as an alternative to the Concept Map style of navigation. An extra button (or menu) will be added to the Arranger to allow choice of the navigation scheme to use.

        <p>
		  The concept map in the Navigator does not have scroll bars
		  when the window gets resized.  As a result some concepts may
		  become invisible.
        </p>

        <!-- the url that this rfe or bug relates to (might be multiple urls here)-->

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->
        <p>
		  After downloading a course and displaying some concepts on the
		  right, somebody may decide to shrink the screen horizontally.
		  CANU does not insert horizontal scroll bars and the concepts
		  that are displayed do not get wrapped around.  They stay in
		  fixed positions, and can become invisible if the screen size
		  is reduced too much.</p>

		  <p>I am not concerned about this one for the purposes of MAP,
		  but maybe there are some other applications of CANU where this
		  could be troublesome.  Usually, though, I would expect people
		  to want to enlarge the window, not decrease it.

         The content table in the Arranger often has vertical and

		   Some of the vertical and horizontal green lines linking

		 <p>
		   This happens both in the concept table that one sees when
		   opening the course and in the concept table that one gets in
		   the pop-up window when one edits an instruction item.

		    If one opens two copies of the same course in the Arranger,
		    one of them will be read-only.  Nevertheless, one can delete
		    items from the read-only course.
        </p>

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->
        <p>Details:

        <p>
		    If one deletes an item from the read-only course, it is
		    removed from the content tree.  However, when one clicks
		    SAVE, the Course Not Saved information does not
		    disappear. So, presumably, the delete did not get saved.
		    However, one does worry.  The system should not allow
		    removal of an item in the read-only mode, i.e., visually the
		    concept tree should not get changed when one clicks on the X
		    or tries to delete from the menu.  Even better, the X and
		    the Delete item in the menu should be dimmed when the
		    read-only course is selected.
		 <p>
		    I did not try this with a read-only course that was
		    different from the other course that was open or with simply
		    a read-only course when no other course was open.  Probably
		    the bug will appear in these cases as well and should be
		    cured as suggested.

		   E.g., when entering the URL's of question choices in

        <p>
		    The Question Editor of the Arranger, in the case of
		    numerical entry, needs an 'else' option.
        </p>

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->
        <p>Details:

		  <p>The typical numerical entry question will require that the
		  user gets a 'correct' response or an 'incorrect' response.
		  The 'correct' response is triggered when the answer lies in
		  the specified range.  The 'incorrect' response should be
		  triggered automatically when the answer lies outside of this
		  range.  It should not be necessary for the instructor to
		  specify the range that will trigger the 'incorrect' response.
		  (This would have to be a 'double' range with one interval
		  below the correct interval and one above it, which would be
		  tedious.)</p>

		  <p>In addition, the system should provide the possibility to
		  catch certain incorrect answers for which one wants to give
		  special responses.  The system is capable of that at
		  present.</p>

		  <p>I suggest there be an entry field in the Arranger labeled
		  'correct answer' and another one labeled 'incorrect answer'.
		  The 'correct answer' field would let you specify the numerical
		  range as at present and the URL.  The 'incorrect answer' field
		  would let you specify only a URL.  In addition, there should
		  be the present pull-down menu that lets you open 1, 2, 3, or 4
		  more fields that allow you to specify a range and a URL.
		  These extra fields might be labeled 'specific incorrect
		  answers'.</p>

		  <p>There would be no ticky-boxes accompanying any of the
		  answer fields, correct or incorrect, because it is clear from
		  the labeling provided by the system what the status of each
		  is.</p>

        <p>To see an example of how complicated things can get with
        the present Question Editor, look at Vectors/Addition/Test
        Yourself/Resultant Angle.  In this example, there is a correct
        range, one incorrect range below the correct range, one
        incorrect range above the correct range up to a specific
        incorrect range, then the specific incorrect range, then the
        incorrect range above the specific range.  Things work this
        way, but it is a pain to enter things this way.</p>

		   In the Question Editor of the Arranger, one can specify the

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->

		   When one copies an instruction item from one part of a course
		   into another part of the same course, the Get Information
		   items don't get copied.  However, the Related Topics do get
		   copied.  Related Topics attached to a Concept Item get copied
		   as well.
        </p>

        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->
        <p>Details:

        <p>When copying an Instruction Item from one part of a course
        to another, one may not always want to keep all Get
        Information or Related Topics items, because the Instruction
        Item may serve a different purpose in the new location. Thus,
        in general, the Get Information and Related Topics items will
        have to be edited when moving an Instruction item.  However,
        it is easier to delete a few of these than to add them.
        Therefore, I suggest that all of these items should be copied
        when copying an Instruction item.

			  This behaviour of eliminating "foreign" Get Information item references within a copied subtree is an intentional feature of the system. However, it is desirable to maintain these "foreign" references if the subtree is pasted back into a tree which contains the foreign items referenced. This should be attended to eventually.

		  There is still the old MAP icon on the top left corner when

			  It is not trivial to eliminate the icon all together. If an icon is not specified, the default Java L&F icon is used. I suggest we keep using the "MAP" icon until a suitable canu icon is created.

        <!-- the url that this rfe or bug relates to (might be multiple urls here)-->


        <!-- a longer explanation of the problem or request -->
        <p>Details:</p>
       
		  <p>In entering error margins, one has a choice between 'None',
'Relative', and 'Bounded'.  At first I just typed values into
'Bounded' and did not realize I had to check the related radio button.
When testing in the Navigator, the question performed incorrectly.

        <p>I suggest the following interface.  The default is to have
        the None radio button checked and the other two data entry
        field radio buttons unchecked.  If somebody types into either
        'Relative' or 'Bounded', the button for that field gets
        checked automatically, and the other two radio butttons get
        unchecked automatically.</p>

		  <p>I also suggest that as soon as a correct value (or target
		  value) is entered, that the lower and upper bounds under
		  'Bounded' be set equal to this correct value automatically.
		  Then, if somebody should check the corresponding radio button,
		  these two values are consistent.  If somebody types in a lower
		  bound and forgets to type the upper bound, again the bounds
		  are consistent.  If somebody types a lower bound that is
		  larger than the correct value, or types an upper bound that is
		  lower than the correct value, the system should beep and
		  restore the previous (consistent) value in the slot when the
		  user hits Enter. </p>

		  <p>Finally, I suggest to replace the label 'Bounded' by
		  'Absolute'.</p>
