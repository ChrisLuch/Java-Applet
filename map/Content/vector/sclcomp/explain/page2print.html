<p><center><h4>Scalar Components of Vectors</center></h4>


<p>The diagram shows the scalar components of a
vector <b>a</b>, the x-component in green and the
y-component in yellow.



<p>The scalar components of vector <b>a</b> are scalars, denoted
a<sub>x</sub> and a<sub>y</sub>.



<p>If the tail end of the vector is at the origin, its scalar
components are simply the x and y coordinates of the tip of the
vector, here equal to -4 and 6, respectively.


<p>You can denote vector <b>a</b> in terms of its scalar components
as follows:


<p> <b>a</b> = (a<sub>x</sub>, a<sub>y</sub>) = (-4, 6).
