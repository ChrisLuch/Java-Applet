<p><b>Question</b>: Now let's do the reverse to calculating the
components of a given vector. 

<p>Suppose the components of a vector are given relative to a pair of
<i>x</i>,<i>y</i> axes. How would you calculate the magnitude of the
vector and the angle <font face="symbol">q</font> between the vector
and the positive <i>x</i>-axis?

<p>Do this for the vector shown with its components on the left.  The
answers are provided by the applet, but go on to page 8 to compare
your calculation.
