<p><b>Question</b>. If two forces <img src="F.gif" align="bottom"> and
<img src="Gcap.gif" align="bottom">, as represented by the arrows
shown on the left, are acting on a particle, is there a single force,
<img src="Hcap.gif" align="bottom">, that has the same effect as <img
src="F.gif" align="bottom"> and <img src="Gcap.gif" align="bottom">
combined?

<p><b>Answer</b>. The answer is YES, according to Newton, who claimed
in his Principia that this single equivalent force <img src="Hcap.gif"
align="bottom"> is the vector sum

<p align="center"><img src="Hcap.gif" align="bottom"> = <img
src="F.gif" align="bottom"> + <img src="Gcap.gif" align="bottom">.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>. If one or several forces are acting on a particle,
how do they affect the particle's motion? 

<p><b>Answer</b>. According to Newton's second law of motion, the
vector sum of all forces acting on a particle determines the
particle's acceleration.  

<p>Thus, we need to be able to add vectors.  There are many other
situations in physics where vectors need to be added.

<p>The easiest way to calculate the sum of two vectors is to use
scalar components.

<p>The following pages will explain what scalar components are and how
to use them.
