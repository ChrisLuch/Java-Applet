  <div class="title">Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar</div>

<p>On Page 1, no applet is available in the applet area.  Just read
the following overview.

<p>Vectors are different from scalars and therefore cannot be added to
scalars, just as oranges are different from numbers and cannot be
added to numbers.</p>  

<p>However, vectors can be multipled by scalars, just as it makes
sense to talk about 2 oranges or even 1.5 oranges.

<p>Multiplication of vectors by scalars is very similar to multiplying
oranges by numbers.  The only difference from scalar multiplication of
oranges is that vectors can be multiplied even by negative numbers.
All this will be explained on the following pages.
