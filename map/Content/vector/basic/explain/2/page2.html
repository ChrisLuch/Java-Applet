  <p><u>2. Polar (positive & negative)</u>. The applet is now set to
this mode.  Observe how the vector's angle changes as you drag the
vector's tip around the origin.

<p>In this mode, vectors are again specified by their magnitude and an
angle, but the angle is defined differently.  The same reference line
is used, pointing horizontally to the right.  However, both positive
and negative angles are used, positive angles for vectors pointing
somewhere above and negative angles for vectors pointing somewhere
below the horizontal axis.

<p>Starting from 0<sup>o</sup>, the angle increases (decreases) to
180<sup>o</sup> (-180<sup>o</sup>) as the vector rotates in the
positive (negative) sense.  180<sup>o</sup> and -180<sup>o</sup> both
specify a vector pointing horizontally to the left.  

<p><b>Question</b>.  What would be the angle for the vector in the
Figure on Page 1 according to the "Polar (pos & neg)" method?  Find
the answer by using the applet.

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The answer is -120<sup>o</sup>.  See the Figure
below.
