<p>Yes, the displacement of a particle from a point A to a point B is
a vector quantity because it can be characterized by a magnitude
(distance between the two points) and a direction (the direction from
point A to point B).</p>

<p>Magnitude and direction are the two characteristic attributes of
vectors.</p>

<p><u>Comment</u>.  Distinguish between the concepts
<b>displacement</b> and <b>distance</b>.  Displacement is a vector,
carrying information about direction in addition to  magnitude, while
distance is a scalar.  The distance between points A and B is equal to
the <b>magnitude</b> of the displacement from A to B.</p>
