      <p><b>Purpose of the applet</b>.</p>

      <p>
        A vector in two dimensions requires two numbers for its complete
        specification. Different kinds of number pairs are possible to specify a
        vector. The applet presents the two main possibilities: (a)
        specification in terms of magnitude and direction (polar form) and (b)
        specification in terms of orthogonal x and y components (Cartesian
        form). The polar form is presented in three different ways,
        distinguished by how the direction of a vector is specified.

        For details on how to use the applet and for a lesson on different ways
        of specifying a vector, please go to AppletHelp on the applet's Help
        menu.
