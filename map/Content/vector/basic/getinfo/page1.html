    <div class="title">Vector Basics</div>
          
    <p>A <i>vector</i> is a quantity that has both <b>magnitude</b> and
    <b>direction</b>.  Examples of vector quantities in physics are
    displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force.</p>

    <p>A vector can be represented graphically by an arrow:</p>


    <div align="center"><img src="arrow.gif"></div>


    <p>The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the
    vector. The direction of the arrow, going from the tail end to the
    tip, represents the direction of the vector.</p>


          <p><b>Notation</b>. To denote a vector quantity in
          handwriting, one uses an arrow over the letter, as in <img
          src="a.gif" align="bottom">. Textbooks use boldface symbols
          to denote vectors.  In MAP, we are using both boldface and
          arrows.  Some textbooks follow this practice as well.

          <p>The magnitude of the vector <img src="a.gif"
          align="bottom">, which is also called its <i>absolute
          value</i>, is denoted either by the same letter <i>a</i>
          without an arrow, or by |<img src="a.gif" align="bottom">|.

  <p>Vectors are different from numbers, also called <i>scalars</i>.  To
  distinguish between the two kinds of quantities, write vectors with an
  arrow over the letter, scalars without an arrow.</p>

  <p>Vectors can be added and subtracted, and the result will again be a
  vector.  They can also be multiplied by scalars, the result again
  being a vector.  These two kinds of operations characterize all vector
  quantities, in spaces of any given number of dimensions.</p>

  <p>However, vectors can <b>not</b> be <b>added</b> to scalars.  (What
  would the result be?)  And a vector can in general <b>not</b> be
  <b>multiplied</b> by another vector such that the result is again a
  vector.  A vector also cannot be divided by another vector.</p>

  <p><u>Comment</u>. One <b>can</b> define a <i>scalar product</i> (dot
  product) of two vectors that yields a scalar, not a vector.  In three
  dimensions, but not in other dimensions in general, one can also
  define a <i>vector product</i> (cross product) of two vectors that
  yields a vector.
