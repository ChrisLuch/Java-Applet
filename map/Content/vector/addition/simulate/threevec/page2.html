        <b>Draw three vectors</b> in the drawing area. They will be labeled for
        you.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can change your vectors as much as you like, by dragging them at their
      tips or tail ends. You can also move a vector by dragging it at the
      middle.
      </p>

      <p>On the next page, these vectors will be unchangable.</p>
