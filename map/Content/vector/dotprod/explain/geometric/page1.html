  <div class="title">Dot or Scalar Product</div>


<p>The dot product or scalar product of two vectors assigns to the
vectors <img src="a.gif" align="bottom"> and <img src="b.gif"
align="bottom"> a scalar (number) denoted <img src="a.gif"
align="bottom"><img src="dot.gif" align="bottom"><img src="b.gif"
align="bottom">.  Note the dot between the two vector symbols which
gives the product its name.


<p>You can experiment with the scalar product by varying either
vector.  To change a vector, click on its tip and drag the tip with
the mouse.

<p>Observe how the dot product of the two vectors changes as you
change the magnitudes of the two vectors or the angle between them, and
check its value using the equation given in the control panel.
