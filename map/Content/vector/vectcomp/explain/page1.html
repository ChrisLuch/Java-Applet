    <P>Vector components of vectors must be distinguished from scalar
    components of vectors.  The former are vectors, the latter are scalars
    (numbers).  See "Scalar Components" under Get Information.

    <p>The illustration on the left shows an example where vector
    components are useful.  The green vector in the diagram is the weight
    force acting on the block.  Its two vector components are in red.

    <P>Vector components of vectors will now be explained graphically and
    then related to scalar components.
