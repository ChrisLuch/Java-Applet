                <p>


                <p>Vector <img src="Acap.gif" align="bottom"> has more than just one
                pair of Cartesian vector components.

                <p>In fact, it has infinately many such pairs. 

                <p>On a sheet of paper, try to draw one or two different pairs of
                        vector components for the vector shown here.

                <p>When done, go on to the next
                        page where you can see some examples.
