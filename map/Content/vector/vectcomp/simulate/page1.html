        <h1>Vector Components Practice</h1>
      </div>

      <p>The diagram shows a vector <img src="../explain/Acap.gif" align="bottom">. Draw two more vectors on the screen that added together are equal to <img src="../explain/Acap.gif" align="bottom">. The two vectors should be orthogonal to each other.  The program will label these vectors <img src="../explain/Acap.gif" align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> and <img src="../explain/Acap.gif" align="bottom"><sub>2</sub>.  They are called <img src="../explain/Wcap.gif" align="bottom"> of <img src="../explain/Acap.gif" align="bottom">.</p>



      <p>To draw a vector or a line or dotted line, select the appropriate tool button and then draw with the mouse. To delete an item, select it (by clicking on it) and then press DELETE. </p>

      <p>When you have drawn two component vectors on the screen, the program will automatically display their sum in green if it equals <img src="../explain/Acap.gif" align="bottom"> within a reasonable margin, and if the two component vectors are reasonably orthogonal to each other.  Otherwise the sum will be shown in red. The angle between your two component vectors is indicated at the bottom. Your task is to construct two vectors such that this angle is 90 degrees and the resultant vector turns green.</p>

      <p>You can drag any of the vectors or lines on the screen, except for the vector in red (or green). You can change any of the vectors or lines that you have drawn by clicking on them at one of their endpoints and then dragging this endpoint.</p>
