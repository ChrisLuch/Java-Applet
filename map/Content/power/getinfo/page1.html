<p><b>Definition</b></p>

<p>The <i>instantaneous power</i>, <i>P</i>, is the rate in time at
which energy is generated or dissipated at a given instant.  For
details, see Page 2.</p>

<p><b>Note about energy generation or dissipation</b></p>

<p>Energy can be neither created nor destroyed.  When talking about
energy 'generation' or 'dissipation' we are talking about processes of
energy <b>transformation</b>.  E.g., in an electrical power plant,
chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy (and thermal
energy) and one refers to this as 'generation' of electrical energy.</p>

<p>Dissipation of energy takes place in processes involving mechanical
friction or the passage of electrical charge through resistors.  In
either case, ordered mechanical or electrical energy is transformed
into less ordered thermal energy.</p>
