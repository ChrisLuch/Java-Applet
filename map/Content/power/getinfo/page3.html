  <div class="title">Power in Mechanical Systems</div>

<p>Work is a transfer of mechanical energy.  Therefore, the mechanical
input to our output from a system is equal to the rate in time at
which work is being done on or by the system.</p>

<p><b>One-dimensional motion</b></p>

<p>Suppose the system consists of a particle moving along an x-axis
and that it has a force acting on it that is pointing in the positive
or negative x-direction with x-component <i>F<sub>x</sub></i>.  At a
given instant, the particle has an x-component of velocity
<i>v<sub>x</sub></i> so that the x-component d<i>x</i> of the
particle's displacement during the infinitesimal time interval
d<i>t</i> is equal to <i>v<sub>x</sub></i>d<i>t</i>.</p>

<p>The work d<i>W</i> done on the particle during the infinitesimal
time interval is</p>

<div class="equation">d<i>W</i> = <i>F<sub>x</sub></i>d<i>x</i>.</div>

<p>Therefore the power transfer to the particle by the given force,
i.e., the rate at which the force is doing work on the particle
(transmitting energy to the particle) is equal to</p>

<div class="equation"><i>P</i> = d<i>W</i>/d<i>t</i> =
<i>F<sub>x</sub></i> d<i>x</i>/d<i>t</i> = <i>F<sub>x</sub></i>
<i>v<sub>x</sub></i> .</div>

<p>The power is positive, i.e., energy is being added to the particle,
if the force and velocity are in the same direction.  The power is
negative, i.e., energy is being taken away from the particle, if the
force and velocity are in opposite directions.</p>

<p><b>Example</b>.  If at a given instant a force <i>F<sub>x</sub></i>
= 20 N is acting on a particle moving with velocity
<i>v<sub>x</sub></i> = -5.0 m/s, the power transferred to the particle
at that instant is <i>P</i> = 20x(-5.0) = - 100 W.  The negative value
means that energy is being transmitted at a negative rate, i.e., that
the particle's energy is decreasing.</p>

<p>If several forces are acting on the particle at once, the total
power is the sum of the powers due to the individual forces.</p>
