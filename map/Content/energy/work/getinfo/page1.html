  <p><b>Work: Generalities</b>

  <p>Work is a transfer of mechanical energy to a system.  Like
  energy, work is a scalar quantity.  The SI-unit of work, like that
  of energy, is the joule (J).</p>

  <p>When mechanical energy is being transferred to a system, one says
  that <i>work is being done on the system</i>.  For work to be done
  on a system, there must be a force acting on the system, and one
  says that the <i>force is doing work on the system</i>. The work
  done by a force can be either positive, negative or zero.  Positive
  work being done on a system means that energy is being added to the
  system, and negative work being done on the system means that energy
  is being taken away from the system.</p>

  <p><b>Work done by a constant force: simplest case (one dimension)</b>

  <p align="center"><img src="Work0.gif"></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 1</b></p>

        <p>Figure 1 illustrates a situation in which a <b>constant</b>
        force <img src="F.gif" align="bottom"> is acting on a green
        block during a time interval during which the point (round
        black dot) at which the force is acting on the block undergoes
        a displacement <img src="d.gif" align="bottom"> in the
        direction of the force.  The work <i>W</i> done on the block
        by this force is defined as

		  <p align="center"><i>W</i> = <i>Fd</i>, <img src="small.gif"
		  height="1" width="40"> (1)

		  <p>i.e., as the product of the magnitude <i>F</i> of the force
		  and the magnitude <i>d</i> of the displacement.

		  <p>Figure 2 below illustrates a similar situtation, but this
		  time the block's displacement is opposite to the direction of
		  the force.  (Several circumstances can make this possible.
		  E.g., the initial velocity of the block could be to the left
		  and the applied force <img src="F.gif" align="bottom"> might
		  be slowing the block down while the block continues moving
		  left.  Or there could be other forces besides <img src="F.gif"
		  align="bottom"> acting on the block that are not shown in
		  Figure 2 and are directed to the left.)

  <p align="center"><img src="Work00.gif"></p> 

  <p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b></p>

        <p>In this case, the work done by force <img src="F.gif"
        align="bottom"> on the block is defined as

        <p align="center"><i>W</i> = -<i>Fd</i>, <img src="small.gif"
        height="1" width="40"> (2)
                                                                                                     
        <p>i.e., as the negative of the expression in Equation (1).

		  <p><u>Comment</u>.  The point at which the force is acting
		  plays a crucial role in this definition.  It is the
		  displacement <img src="d.gif" align="bottom"> of this point
		  that matters in the definition of work, not the displacement
		  of the object.  In the case of a rigid block that is not
		  rotating, the displacement of the point at which the force is
		  acting is also the displacement of the block itself and of
		  every part of the block. However, when a rigid object is
		  rotating or when an object is deformable and changing shape,
		  different parts of the object will undergo different
		  displacements.
