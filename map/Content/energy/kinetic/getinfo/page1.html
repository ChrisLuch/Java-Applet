        <p>Kinetic energy is a <b>scalar</b> quantity.  Historically, there
        was a lot of uncertainty about what quantity would measure the
        'amount of motion' of a body.  There was debate about whether to
        choose something that we now call 'momentum', which is proportional
        to the first power of speed, or something like what we now call
        'kinetic energy', which is proportional to the second power of
        speed.  Momentum, as it is defined now, is a vector quantity, but
        kinetic energy (and any other form of energy as well), is a scalar
        quantity.  By definition, kinetic energy does <b>not</b> have a
        direction.</p>
            
        <p><u>Definition 1</u>.  The <i>kinetic energy of a point
        particle</i> is defined as follows.</p>

        <blockquote>The kinetic energy <i>K</i> of a particle of mass
        <i>m</i> and speed <i>v</i> is given by</p>

        <p align="center"><i>K</i> = (<i>m</i>/2) <i>v</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>

        <p><u>Definition 2</u>. The <i>kinetic energy of a system of point
        particles</i> is defined as follows.</p>

        <p align="center"><img src="KineticEnergy2.gif"></p>

        <blockquote>The kinetic energy <i>K</i> of a system of particles of
        masses <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., and speeds
        <i>v</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>v</i><sub>2</sub>, ..., respectively, is
        given by</p>

        <p align="center"><i>K</i> = (<i>m</i><sub>1</sub>/2)
        <i>v</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + (<i>m</i><sub>2</sub>/2)
        <i>v</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + ... .</p>
