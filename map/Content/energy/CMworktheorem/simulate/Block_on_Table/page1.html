        Applied Force and to Friction</div>

        </p>

        <p>The applet on Page 2 simulates the motion of a block on a
        horizontal surface.  The block is subject to friction and to an
        applied force.  
        </p>

        <p>For detailed information on how to use the applet, please see
        Help, Assumptions, and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's Help
        menu.
        </p>

        <p>
        The CM-work theorem is useful for understanding the motion of a
        block sliding on a horizontal surface.  For suggestions on
        investigations possible with the applet, see Activities under
        Related Items.
