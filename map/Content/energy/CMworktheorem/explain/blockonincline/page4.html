    <div class="title">CM-Work Theorem Applied To A Block On An
    Incline</div>

    <p>The CM-work <i>W<sub>CM,fr</sub></i> done by the friction force on
    the block was calculated on Page 3 to be equal to -1.624 J.  This is
    not equal to the real friction work done on the block.  The real
    friction work is impossible to calculate because the displacements of
    the cold-welds between the block and the incline responsible for
    friction are unknown.

    <p>Nevertheless, it is possible to relate <i>W<sub>CM,fr</sub></i> to
    the change &Delta;<i>E<sub>therm</sub></i> in
    thermal energy of the system consisting of the block <b>and</b>
    incline if one applies the law of conservation of energy to this
    system.  It is not possible to say something about the increase in
    thermal energy of the block alone, or the incline alone, if one does
    not know the real friction work done on either.

    <p>The CM-work theorem applied to the block gives the equation

    <p align="center"><i>W<sub>CM,a</sub></i>
    + <i>W<sub>CM,g</sub></i> = &Delta;<i>KE</i> -
    <i>W<sub>CM,fr</sub></i> <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="40">(1)</p>

    <p>where <i>KE</i> is the block's translational kinetic energy.

    <p>The law of conservation of energy applied to the block-incline
    system gives the equation

    <p align="center"><i>W<sub>a</sub></i> +
    <i>W<sub>g</sub></i> = &Delta;<i>KE</i> + &Delta;<i>E<sub>therm</sub></i>.
    <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="40">(2)</p>

    <p><b>Comments</b>

    <p><ol>

    <li>In Eq.(2), the work on the left-hand side is real work, in
    contrast to Eq.(1) where the work on the left-hand side is CM-work.</li>

    <p><li>The only energy input into the block-incline system is the work
    done by the applied and gravitational forces because these are the
    only <b>external</b> forces acting on the system.  Friction is an
    internal force and therefore no friction work should be included on
    the left-hand side of Eq.(2).</li>

    <p><li>Friction is an external force when the system is taken to be
    just the block, and therefore the CM-work due to friction must be
    included in Eq.(1).</li>

    </ol>

    <p>In the present case, where the block is not rotating, the
    displacements of the points at which the applied and gravitational
    forces are acting are equal to the displacements of the CM of the
    block.  Therefore, the amounts of real work done by the applied and
    gravitational forces on the block are equal to the amounts of CM-work
    done by these forces on the block,

    <p align="center"><i>W<sub>a</sub></i> =
    <i>W<sub>CM,a</sub></i> <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="30">
    and <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="30"> <i>W<sub>g</sub></i> =
    <i>W<sub>CM,g</sub></i>. <img src="small.gif" height="1" width="30"> (3)</p>

    <p>Thus, the left-hand sides of Eqs. (1) and (2) are equal.
    Therefore, the right-hand sides must be equal also, which implies

    <p align="center">&Delta;<i>E<sub>therm</sub></i>
    = -<i>W<sub>CM,fr</sub></i> = -(-1.624) = 1.624 J.<img src="small.gif"
    height="1" width="30"> (4)</p>

    <p>Thus, the negative of the CM-work done on the block is equal to the
    change in the thermal energy of the block-incline system.
