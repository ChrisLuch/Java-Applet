    <div class="title">Energy - What Is It?</div>

    <p>
      There is a very general principle in physics that has proven to be
      most frutiful: the <b>Principle of Energy Conservation</b>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      It is possible to define an energy for every system such that the
      energy of the system is conserved if the system is isolated and that
      the energy of the system plus its environment is conserved if there
      is energy transfer between the system and its environment. In more
      detail, this means the following.
    <br>
    <br>
      For different kinds of systems, energy has to be defined
      differently, e.g., as mechanical, electric, or thermal energy.  One
      kind of energy can be transformed into another kind, and energy can
      be transferred from one system to another.  The <i>principle of
      energy conservation</i> says that energy can be defined in such a
      way that the energy of an isolated system is conserved no matter
      what is happening inside the system and that the total energy of a
      system and its environment is conserved in processes involving
      energy transfer between the system and its environment.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>Example</b>. Imagine a system consisting of two stars revolving
      around each other, a so-called <i>binary star system</i>.  In
      response to the gravitational forces that the stars exert on each
      other, the stars in general will be following elliptical paths and
      at certain times will be getting closer to each other and at other
      times will be getting farther away from each other.  When they are
      getting closer to each other, they are getting faster and their
      kinetic energies increase.  When they are moving farther away from
      each other, the kinetic energies of the stars decrease.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we defined the total energy of the binary star system to be the
      sum of the kinetic energies of the two stars, this energy would
      <b>not</b> be conserved.  However, the principle of energy
      conservation tells us that it must be possible to define an energy
      for this system that <b>is</b> conserved.  One can define a
      potential energy for the system so that the sum of the kinetic and
      potential energy is conserved.  When the kinetic energy of
      the system increases, the potential energy decreases, and vice
      versa, such that the sum of the two remains unchanged.
    </p>

      The applet on Page 6 simulates a binary star system and illustrates
      the system's kinetic and potential energies by means of an energy
      bar.  The total height of the bar remains constant while the bar's
      kinetic and potential energy portions are changing.
