      Energy - Properties
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Energy is a scalar quantity.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Energy is an <i>additive</i> quantity. This means that the
        total energy of a system is the sum of the energies of the
        parts of the system.<br>
        <br>
         Can you think of a counter-example, a quantity that is
        <b>not</b> additive? Temperature is one. It does not make
        sense to talk about the 'total temperature' in a building
        by adding the temperatures in all the rooms of the
        building.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Energy comes in different forms: mechanical, thermal,
        chemical, nuclear, etc.<br>
        <br>
         Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential
        energy. Potential energy is related to internal
        conservative forces of a system. It has different
        mathematical expressions, depending on what forces are
        involved.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Energy of one form can be transformed into energy of
        another form, but energy cannot be created or
        destroyed.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Energy can be 'moved' in or out of a system. Scientists say
        that energy can be 'transferred'.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        There are different kinds of energy transfer, e.g., work,
        heat, and radiation. Work is transfer of mechanical energy.
        Heat is transfer of thermal energy. Electromagnetic
        radiation is transfer of electromagnetic energy.
      </li>
    </ol>

      The simulation on Page 3 illustrates the most basic ones of
      these properties. For details on how the applet functions and
      a lesson related to the applet, see Applet Help on the
      applet's Help menu.
