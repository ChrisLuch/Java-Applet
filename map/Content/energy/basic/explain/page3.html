      <div class="title">Energy Simulation</div>

      <p>In the applet window on the left, there is a white area containing
      red and blue blocks.  This represents a <i>system</i> containing two
      kinds of energy:
      </p>

      <ul>

      <li>kinetic energy (KE)</li>

      <li>potential energy (PE).</li>

      </ul>

      <p>The energy E, whose nature the applet does not specify, outside of
      the system is represented by green blocks.

      <p>By double-clicking an energy block (1 joule) inside the system you
      can change it from one kind into the other kind.  You can also drag
      energy blocks out of the system or into the system.

      <p>Observe that whatever you do, the sum of all the energies, inside
      and outside the system, is <i>conserved</i>.  It always is equal to 46
      joules (J).

      <p>For details on how the applet functions, consult Help and ShowMe
      under Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.  There is also a Lesson
      related to the applet under Applet Help.
