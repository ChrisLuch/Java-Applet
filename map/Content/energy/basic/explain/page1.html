      <spacer type="vertical" size=10">

      <p>Energy is quite an abstract concept.  One cannot point to an
      object and say 'here is the energy of the object'.  One cannot see or
      hear energy.  Still, energy is everywhere.  The poet William Blake has

      "Energy is the only life, and is from the Body; and Reason is the
      bound or outward circumference of Energy;"
      </blockquote>

      <p><blockquote>

      "Energy is Eternal Delight."

      <p>It is difficult to give a definition of the term 'energy' the way
      physicists use it.  Let us start by listing some of the properties of
      energy.  This is done on the next page.

      <p>Can you think of some properties of energy yourself?  How would
      <b>you</b> explain to somebody what energy is?
