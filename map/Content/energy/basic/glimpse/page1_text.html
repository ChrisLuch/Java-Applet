<p>Watch the video from the Video Encyclopedia of Physics.</p>

<p>It demonstrates several aspects of energy:</p>

<p>1. There are different forms of energy</u>:

<ul>

<li>chemical energy in the young lady's muscles,

<li>rotational energy (which is a kind of mechanical energy) in the
heavy weights,

<li>electrical energy in the generator,

<li>light energy coming from the bulb,

<li>thermal energy in the bulb and elsewhere,</li>

</ul>

<p>2.  Energy can transform from one kind to another.  Here it is
being transformed in the order listed above.</p>

<p>3.  Energy can be transferred from one place to another, e.g., from the young
lady to the heavy weights or from the interior of the bulb to the
exterior.</p>

<p>4.  The total energy, the sum of all individual energies, is conserved
while energy is being transformed and transferred.</p>
