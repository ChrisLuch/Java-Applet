<div class="title">The Concept of Potential Energy</div>

<p><b>Summary of Qualitative Features of Potential Energy</b></p>

<ul>

<li>Potential energy is a quantity that applies to <b>two</b>-body
systems, <b>not</b> individual bodies.  When using the phrase
<i>potential energy of a ball</i>, one is using simplified language,
used only for brevity's sake.  The so-called 'potential energy of the
ball' is really the potential energy of the ball-earth system.</li>

<li>The potential energy of two gravitationally interacting objects
depends on the distance between the two objects.  It increases as the
distance increases.</li>

<li>If two objects are moving subject to only their gravitational
interaction, the sum of the potential and kinetic energies of this
system is <i>conserved</i>, in other words, it does not change during
the motion.

</ul>

<p><b>Comment</b>.  The force of gravity is called <i>conservative</i>
because a potential energy can be associated with it, such that the
sum of kinetic and potential energy is constant (energy conservation)
if no other forces are acting on the system.  There are also
<i>non-conservative</i> forces, with which no potential energy can be
associated.  Examples of the latter occur in the systems studied on
Pages 13 to 18 in this session.</p>
