<div class="title">Potential Energy Quantitative</div>

<p>So far, we have considered only vertical motions.  The potential
energy concept and the expression mgy + const for the gravitational
potential energy applies also to projectile motions in which the
ball's velocity has a non-zero horizontal component.</p>

<p>The gravitational potential energy of an object of mass <i>m</i>
near the earth's surface is given by</p>

<p class="equation"><i>PE</i> = <i>mgy</i> + const</p>

<p>no matter what the object's horizontal x-coordinate is.  The
gravitational potential energy depends only on an object's elevation
<i>y</i> because the gravitational force is doing no work on an object
moving horizontally.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  A 0.4-kg ball that is at <i>y</i> = 0 has a speed
<i>v</i> = 10 m/s and, therefore, a kinetic energy <i>KE</i> = 20
J. Take <i>PE</i> = 10 J at <i>y</i> = 0, as set in the simulation.
What will be the potential energy and speed of the ball at <i>y</i> =
- 2 m?

<p>Work this out for an arbitrary launch angle.  The answer should not
depend on this angle.  Taking <i>PE</i> = 10 J at <i>y</i> = 0 will
give you some practice with the 'const' term in the expression for
<i>PE</i>.</p>

<p>You may first want to find the answer 'experimentally' with the
simulation.  Try it for several launch angles.  You can set the ball
to the right speed by watching the kinetic energy bar.  You can drag
the ball horizontally to create more room for the motion.</p>
