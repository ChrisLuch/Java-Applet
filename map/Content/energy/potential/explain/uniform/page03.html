<div class="title">The Concept of Potential Energy</div>

<p>Play the animation and observe the motion.</p>

<p><b>Three Questions</b>.</p>  

<ol>

<li>After the ball has been thrown, how many bodies are involved in
making the ball's motion the way it is?</li>

<li>What does the ball's motion have in common with the motion on Page
2?</li>

<li>What is different?</li>  

</ol>

<p><b>Answers</b>.</p>

<ol>

<li><b>Two</b> bodies, the ball <b>and</b> the earth.  If the earth
were not there, the ball would continue to move upward when thrown
upward.</li>

<li>As the distance between the ball and the earth increases (ball
rising), the ball slows down and its kinetic energy decreases.  As the
distance decreases (ball falling), the ball speeds up and its kinetic
energy increases.</li>

<li>The earth does not move perceptibly as the ball goes up and down.
(This is so because the earth is so much more massive than the ball.
However, the earth does move as the ball moves, but only a tiny tiny
amount.  Thus, in principle, this is a two-body system just like the
system on Pages 1 and 2.)</li>
