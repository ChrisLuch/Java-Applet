<div class="title">Potential Energy in Pendulum Motion</div>

<p>Now let's use energy conservation to study the simple pendulum
quantitatively.  Our pendulum consists of a massive bob attached to a
massless rigid rod.  You can drag the bob to the starting position you
want.  The pendulum has no friction.</p>

<p><b>Run</b> the simulation.  Button 1 will display the two external
forces acting on the pendulum, the gravitational force exerted on the
bob by the earth and the force of constraint exerted on the pendulum
rod by the supporting bearings.

<p>The force of constraint exerted by the bearings on the pendulum
does no work on the pendulum if the bearings are frictionless.  Thus,
no energy loss at the bearings enters the energy balance and the sum of
gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy of the pendulum is
conserved.  However, even though the constraint force has no bearing
on the energy balance, it has a significant effect on the motion:
without it, the pendulum bob would not move in a circular arc.</p>

<p>The constraint force acting on the pendulum is an example of a
<i>non-conservative</i> force.  See the comment at the bottom of Page
5. Non-conservative forces are forces with which no potential energy
is associated.</p>


<p><b>Question</b>.  If the length of the pendulum is <i>l</i> = 4.0 m
and the pendulum starts from rest at <font face="symbol">q</font> =
-120<sup>o</sup>, what is the speed of the bob at the bottom of the
swing?  Take the radius of the bob no larger than 1 m so that the
rotational kinetic energy of the bob due its finite size is
insignificant compared to the bob's translational kinetic energy.</p>

<p>Try to work out the answer using energy conservation.  Take g = 9.8
m s<sup>-2</sup>. Then go to Page 15 to compare.</p>
