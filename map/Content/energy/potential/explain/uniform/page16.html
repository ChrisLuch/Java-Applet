<div class="title">Potential Energy For A Block On An Incline</div>

<p>Let's have a look at a system in which there are <b>three</b>
non-conservative forces and where some of these forces do work on the
system.  The system consists of a block on an incline and the
earth. The three non-conservative forces are an applied force <img
src="F.gif" align="bottom">, the friction force <img src="F.gif"
align="bottom"><sub>fr</sub>, and the normal force <img src="N.gif"
align="bottom">.  In addition, there is the conservative gravitational
force <img src="F.gif" align="bottom"><sub>g</sub>.  The free-body
diagram for the block is shown at the top right in the simulation
window.

<p><b>Question</b>.  Suppose the inclination angle <font
face="symbol">q</font> of the incline is 20<sup>o</sup>, the coefficient
of friction between block and incline is 0.5, the block's mass is 0.4
kg, and the applied force is equal to (2.0, 3.0) N with respect to the
<i>x</i>,<i>y</i> axes shown.  Then, if the block's initial velocity
is 2 m/s up the incline, what is the block's speed after the block has
moved a distance <i>d</i> = 2 m?

<p><b>Hint</b>. Use the CM-work theorem (see under Related Items).
The normal force does no work on the block, because it is at right
angles to the block's displacement.  Thus, the combined CM-work done
by the applied force, the friction force, and the gravitational force
is equal to the change in (<i>M</i>/2)<i>V</i><sup>2</sup>, where
<i>M</i> and <i>V</i> are the mass of the block and the speed of its
center of mass (CM).
