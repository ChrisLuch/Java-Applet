<div class="title">Potential Energy Quantitative</div>

<p><b>Question</b>.  What is the ball's gravitational potential energy
at <i>y</i> = 6 m?  Take the ball's mass to be <i>m</i> = 0.4 kg, and
the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity as <i>g</i> = 10
m/s<sup>2</sup> here, so that you can calculate in your head.</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The equation derived on Page 8 gives</p>

<p class="equation"><i>PE</i> = <i>mgy</i> = 0.4x10x6 = 24 J.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  Suppose the ball's kinetic energy at <i>y</i> =
6 m is 30 J and that the ball is moving upward at this point.  The
ball then reaches the top and falls back down.  As it passes the point
at <i>y</i> = 10 m on the way down, what is its kinetic energy?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  As the ball moves from <i>y</i> = 6 m to the top of
its flight path and then back down to <i>y</i> = 10 m, the change in
its kinetic energy is the negative of its change in potential energy.
(The fact that the ball first rises and then falls does not matter.)
Thus, </p>

<p class="equation"><i>KE<sub>10</sub></i> - <i>KE<sub>6</sub></i> =
- (<i>PE<sub>10</sub></i> - <i>PE<sub>6</sub></i>) .</p>

With <i>PE<sub>10</sub></i> = 0.4x10x10 = 40 J and
<i>PE<sub>6</sub></i> = 24 J, this gives

<p class="equation"><i>KE<sub>10</sub></i> - 30 = - (40 - 24) = -16
J</p>

whence

<p class="equation"><i>KE<sub>10</sub></i> = 30 - 16 = 14 J.</p>

<p>You can check these values with the simulation, roughly.  Make sure
the <i>E</i> and <i>y</i> scales have their zeros on the same level,
so that <i>PE</i> = <i>mgy</i>.
