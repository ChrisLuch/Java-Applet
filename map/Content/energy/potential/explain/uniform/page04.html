<div class="title">The Concept of Potential Energy</div>

<p>The simulation on the left shows the situation of Page 3 once more,
but more from a physicist's perspective.  Instead of the 'trimmings of
daily life', you can see only the ball, plus potential and kinetic
energy bars and scales showing the ball's potential and kinetic
energies and elevation.

<p><b>Tasks</b>.  

<ul>

<li>Drag the ball up and down and observe how the potential energy
changes.  When does it increase?</li>

<li>Increase and decrease the magnitude of the ball's initial velocity
(by dragging the tip of the red velocity vector, up or down) and
observe how the kinetic energy changes.  When does it increase?</li>

<li>Play the simulation and observe the changes in kinetic and
potential energy.  How are they different for the upward and downward
motions?  You can <b>step</b> through the motion.</li>

</ul>
