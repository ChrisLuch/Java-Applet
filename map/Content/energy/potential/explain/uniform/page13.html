<div class="title">Potential Energy in Pendulum Motion</div>

<p>Another system for which energy is conserved is the simple
pendulum, as long as air resistance and other friction is
negligible.</p>

<p><b>Run</b> the simulation on the left with the friction equal to
zero.  (Friction could arise from air resistance and friction at the
support point.)  The large white rectangle represents the system
consisting of the pendulum and the earth.  The blue blocks represent
the system's potential energy, the red blocks its kinetic energy.
Observe how potential energy is converted to kinetic energy during the
motion and vice versa so that the total energy <i>KE</i> + <i>PE</i>
is always the same.</p>

<p>When do the potential energy and the kinetic energy have their
maximum values?</p>

<p>Run the simulation again, this time with friction (you can adjust
the friction with the slider) and observe how the sum <i>KE</i> +
<i>PE</i> decreases and the dissipated energy <i>DE</i> increases,
such that the sum of the three energies, <i>KE</i> + <i>PE</i> +
<i>DE</i>, is constant.  The dissipated energy is represented by green
blocks.  They are shown outside the system because we do not consider
the air and the pendulum support to be part of the system.  (The
pendulum bob will initially take up some of the thermal energy
generated during the motion, but this will eventually all be conducted
away to the surrounding air.)</p>
