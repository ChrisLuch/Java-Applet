<p>What can we use for PE that depends on the positions of the particles
and that added to the total kinetic energy KE = KE1 + KE2 gives a
constant,

<p>KE + PE = const?

<p>To find this PE note that this equation implies that the
<b>changes</b> Delta PE amd Delta KE that occur in a given time
interval must add up to zero,

<p>Delta KE + Delta PE = 0.

<p>The change in kinetic energy of the system, Delta KE, is equal to
the work W done by the gravitational forces exerted by the two
particles on each other, according to the work-kinetic energy theorem.

<p>Substituting W for Delta KE, the last equation gives 

<p>Delta PE = -W.

<p>Note that W depends on the initial and final positions of the
particles.
