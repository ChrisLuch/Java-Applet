{\sf {Run the simulation to observe the ball's motion.  The motion will be frozen before the ball falls back to the ground.
\par
Observe the potential energy of the system during the motion and notice the components $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ of the ball's overall displacement.  While the ball is in motion, the only force acting on it is the gravitational force $\F = mg$.
\par
Can you find the potential energy of the ball-earth system associated with this force and develop the energy conservation equation?  The answer is given on the next page.
