<center><h2>The Concept of Potential Energy</h2></center>
<IMG ALIGN=Center SRC="p6image.gif">
<p>The three images show snapshots of the two-particle system at different instants during its motion.  Notice that the forces (and therefore the particles' accelerations) change during the motion, both in magnitude and direction.  This is very complicated.  It would be nice to be able to describe the motion more simply.</p>

<p>A simpler description of the motion is in terms of energy.  Energy is a scalar quantity while forces and accelerations are vectors.</p>

<p>The concept of mechanical energy emerged gradually.  The basic idea is that a system like the one illustrated above might have a quantity associated with it that does not change during the motion: the <i>mechanical energy</i>.  This may seem like a wild idea to you, but let's play around with it a bit and see where it takes us.</p>

<p>Notice again that the total kinetic energy of the system increases as the distance between the particles decreases.  Thus, if we want to have a mechanical energy that stays constant during the motion, we must add something to the kinetic energy, call this the <i>potential energy</i>, that decreases as the distance between the particles decreases so that the sum of kinetic and potential energy remains constant.  We would like this potential energy to be a function of the positions of the particles.  The question is: Can such a potential energy be found?
