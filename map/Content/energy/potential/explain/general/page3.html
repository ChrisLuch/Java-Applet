<center><h3>The Concept of Potential Energy</h3></center>

<p>In the double-star system, <b>both</b> bodies are moving.  In
  contrast, in the ball-earth system, it appears as if only the ball
  is moving while the earth is motionless. However, appearances can be
  deceiving.  The earth does move a tiny bit in opposite direction to
  the ball, first down and then back up as the ball goes up and then
  comes down. The earth's movement is not noticeable because the
  earth's mass is huge compared to that of the ball.

<p><b>Question</b>.  On Page 1 it is stated that the potential energy
of two gravitationally interacting bodies increases as the bodies move
apart, and that the kinetic energy decreases by exactly the amount by
which the potential energy increases.

<p>Is this true for the ball-earth system as well?

<p><b>Answer</b>.  When the ball is going up, its speed is decreasing,
and so is its kinetic energy.  This agrees with the statement
qualitatively.  To check whether it is true quantitatively, we need to
measure the potential and kinetic energy changes during the ball's
motion.

<b>Run the animation again</b>.  Here, the motion of the earth-ball
  system is different from the one on Page 2.  Does the preceding
  answer apply to this motion as well?
