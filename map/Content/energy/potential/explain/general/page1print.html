<p>The concept of potential energy applies to two-particle systems,
like the one shown here, and to systems of more than two
particles.  It does <b>not</b> apply to one-particle systems.

\par

Potential energy is a concept related to the interaction between
two particles, e.g., gravitational interaction. 

\par

The particles contained in the system shown here interact
gravitationally. F1 and F are the gravitational forces that
the two particles exert on each other.

\par

Now run the animation and observe the motion of the system.
