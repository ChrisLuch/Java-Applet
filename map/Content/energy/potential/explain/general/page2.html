<center><h3>The Concept of Potential Energy</h3></center>

<p>A double-star system might move like the two bodies in the
simulation on Page 1.

<p>An example of a motion of a two-body system 'closer to home' is
shown on the left.  <b>Run the animation</b> and observe.

<p><b>Question</b>. What two bodies interacting gravitationally are
involved in this motion?

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The two bodies are the ball and the earth.  It is the
gravitational interaction between the two that determines the ball's
motion.

<p><b>Question</b>.  Comparing the ball-earth system shown here and
the double-star system on Page 1, did you observe any differences in
the motions?

<p>Think about this and then go on to the next page.
