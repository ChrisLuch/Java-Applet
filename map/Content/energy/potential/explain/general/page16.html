When the force of interaction between the two particles is variable, one must use very small (infinitesimal) displacements to calculate the work done.  For details, see 'Work' under Get Information.
\par
When you click STEP, very small displacements of the particles are simulated, although they are still much too large.
\par
The work \textit {dW} done on the two particles by the forces of interaction during a very small displacement is equal to
\par
$dW =  \F_2 d \r $
\par
where $\F_2$ is the force exerted on particle 2 (by particle 1) and  $\r =  \r_2 -  \r_1$ is the relative vector pointing from  $\r_1$ to  $\r_2$ and  $\r_1$ and  $\r_2$ are the position vectors of the two particles measured from a fixed point O.
\par
Click STEP several times if you wish to see a derivation of this equation.  In this derivation, Newton's third law is used,
\par
 $\F_1 = - \F_2$.
\par
The change \textit {dPE} in the potential energy of the two-particle system during a very small change in the relative vector $\r$ is then
\par
$ dPE = -dW = - \F_2 d \r. $
\par
To see an application of this equation, go to Energy/Potential Energy/Explain It/Gravitational where it is used to calculate the gravitational potential energy between any two objects at arbitrary distances from each other.
