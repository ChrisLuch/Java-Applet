<center><h2>The Concept of Potential Energy</h2></center>

<b>Preparation</b>:

  <li>Energy/Work</li>
  <li>Energy/Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem</li>
</ul>

<p>The concept of potential energy applies to two-body systems, like
the one shown here. It does <b>not</b> apply to one-body systems. It
also applies to many-body systems.

<p>The potential energy (<i>PE</i>) of a two-body system characterizes
the interaction between the two bodies.  The potential energy has
different values for different separations of the bodies.  The
simulation on the left shows two bodies <b>interacting
gravitationally</b>.  The gravitational potential energy is larger
when the two bodies are farther apart and smaller when they are closer
together.  <b>Move</b> one of the bodies (by dragging it) and observe
how the potential energy changes.

<p>The green arrows represent the forces acting on the two bodies.  If
the bodies move in the directions of the forces, the decrease in
potential energy per distance traveled is greatest.  The potential
energy stays the same if the bodies move at right angles to the
forces.  <b>Check this</b> by moving the bodies.

<p>The red arrows represent the velocities of the bodies.  You can
change the initial velocities by dragging the tips of the red arrows.

<p>In the system simulated here, when the potential energy decreases
by a certain amount, the kinetic energy increases by the same amount,
and vice versa.  <b>Run the simulation</b> and observe how the speeds
of the bodies increase when the distance between the bodies
decreases. (More speed means more kinetic energy.)

<p>There is no change in speed or kinetic energy when the bodies are
moving at right angles to the forces because there is no change in
potential energy in this case.  Try to create this kind of motion.

<p>The simulation is arranged so that the center of mass of the
system stays at rest during the motion.  This way the system does not
drift off the screen.  Notice that the two velocity vectors are always
exactly opposite.  If you adjust one, the other one is adjusted
automatically so that the total momentum of the system stays
zero. <b>Try it</b>.
