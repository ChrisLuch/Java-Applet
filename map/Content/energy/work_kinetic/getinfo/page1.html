      Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem
    </div>
    <p>
      The basic work-kinetic energy theorem applies to a system
      consisting of a single particle only. The general
      work-kinetic energy system applies to a system of particles
      that may interact with each other. A system of particles may
      be gaseous, liquid, or solid. The two theorems are described
      below.

      <b>Work-kinetic energy theorem for a system of particles</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Eq.(1) above also expresses the work-kinetic energy for a
      system of particles, except that <i>W</i> now is the total
      work done on all particles of the system and <i>KE</i> is the
      total kinetic energy of all particles of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      In more detail, the total work <i>W</i> done on a system of
      particles and the total kinetic energy <i>KE</i> of a system
      are defined as follows. Let the system consist of <i>N</i>
      particles, labeled 1 to <i>N</i>. Let us consider some time
      interval during which the net force <img src="F.gif" alt=
      "vector F" align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> acting on Particle 1
      does work <i>W</i><sub>1</sub> on Particle 1 and the kinetic
      energy of Particle 1 changes by <font face=
      "symbol">D</font><i>KE</i><sub>1</sub>. Similarly for
      Particles 2 to <i>N</i>. Then
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>W</i> = <i>W</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>W</i><sub>2</sub> + ...
      + <i>W<sub>N</sub></i> <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40">(3)
    </p>and 
    <p align="center">
      <i>KE</i> = <i>KE</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>KE</i><sub>2</sub> +
      ... + <i>KE<sub>N</sub></i>. <img src="small.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40">(4)
    </p>
    <p>
      To derive the work-kinetic energy theorem for a system of
      particles, all one has to do is write down Eq.(1) separately
      for each particle and sum the resulting <i>N</i> equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Comment</u>. When dealing with a system of particles, one
      distinguishes between internal and external forces acting on
      the particles of the system. Internal forces are forces
      exerted on a particle by other particles of the system, and
      external forces are forces exerted on a particle by objects
      that are not part of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can write the total work done on the system as the sum of
      the total work done on all particles by the internal forces,
      <i>W<sub>int</sub></i>, and the total work done on all
      particles by the external forces, <i>W<sub>ext</sub></i>,
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>W</i> = <i>W<sub>int</sub></i> + <i>W<sub>ext</sub></i>.
