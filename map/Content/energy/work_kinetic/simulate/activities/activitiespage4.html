<div class="title">Activities on Work and Kinetic Energy in Projectile
Motion</div>

 <p>
   The following Activities are for the 'Work and Energy in Free
   Fall' applet.  Make sure you know how the applet functions by
   consulting Help and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's Help
   menu.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 1</b>.  The purpose of Activity 1 is to use the
   work-kinetic energy theorem to predict the height a ball will reach
   that is thrown upward with a given speed at a given angle.  Air
   resistance is ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
   RESET the applet.  Set the following parameters and the following
   initial conditions at <i>t</i> = 0 for the ball:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>
  </li>
  <li>
   mass of ball: <i>m</i> = 200 g
  </li>
  <li>
   (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)(0) = (10, 10) m
  </li>
  <li>
   speed: <i>v</i>(0) = 25 m/s
  </li>
  <li>
   launch angle: <font face="symbol">q</font>(0) = 30<sup>o</sup>
  </li> 
 </ul>
 <p>
   <u>Outline</u>
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(a)</b> Calculate <i>KE</i>(0).<br>
   <b>(b)</b> Calculate <i>KE</i><sub>top</sub> and <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>.<br>
   <b>(c)</b> Compare the work <i>W</i> shown in the Data box to <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>.<br>
   <b>(d)</b> In your Notebook, draw both the ball's displacement and
   the force of gravity acting on the ball as the ball goes to the
   peak of its trajectory.  On the basis of this diagram, determine
   the sign of <i>W</i>.<br>
   <b>(e)</b> From the equation, <i>W</i> = <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>, calculate the height <i>h</i> of
   the ball's trajectory.<br>
   <b>(f)</b> Repeat all of the above for a different mass.
 </p>
 <p>
   <u>Details</u>
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(a)</b> Calculate the ball's kinetic energy <i>KE</i>(0) at
   <i>t</i> = 0.  Compare your result with the value shown in the Data
   box.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(b)</b> Calculate the ball's kinetic energy
   <i>KE<sub>top</sub></i> at the peak of the ball's trajectory. Hint:
   The horizontal component of the ball's velocity is constant and
   equal to the ball's speed at the peak.
 </p>
 <p>
   Determine <i>KE<sub>top</sub></i> 'experimentally' with the applet.
   To get a good value, STEP towards the peak of the trajectory using
   a sufficiently small time step setting.  Watch the ball's elevation
   <i>y</i> change in the Data box.  If you overshoot, REWIND the
   applet and try again.
 </p>
 <p>
   Does your experimental value of <i>KE<sub>top</sub></i> agree with
   the value you have calculated?
 </p>
 <p>
   What is the change <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> in the
   ball's kinetic energy from the start of the motion to the peak of
   the trajectory?
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(c)</b> The Data box shows the gravitational work <i>W</i> done
   since the beginning of the motion.  <i>W</i> is equal to the net
   work done on the ball because the force of gravity is the only
   force acting on the ball.  
 </p>
 <p>
   The work-kinetic energy theorem requires that net work done on the
   ball up to a given instant is equal to the ball's kinetic energy
   change <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> up to that
   instant. Can you confirm that this is true at the peak of the
   ball's trajectory when you compare your value of <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> to the value of W shown in the Data
   box?
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(d)</b> At the peak of the trajectory, or as near to it as you
   can get, display the ball's displacement vector from the start to
   the peak and the force of gravity acting on the ball.  Draw both
   vectors in your Notebook, tail-to-tail.  Observe that the vectors
   form an angle greater than 90<sup>o</sup> between them, which means
   that the work <i>W</i> done on the ball by the gravitational force
   during this displacement is negative.  This, in turn, means that
   the ball slows down as it goes up.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(e)</b> Since the <i>x</i>-component of the force of gravity is
   equal to zero,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>W</i> = <i>F<sub>x</sub>d<sub>x</sub></i> +
   <i>F<sub>y</sub>d<sub>y</sub></i> = 0 +
   (-<i>mg</i>)<i>d<sub>y</sub></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
 </p>
 <p>
   where 
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>d<sub>y</sub></i> = <i>h</i> - 10 m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
 </p>
 <p>
   is the <i>y</i>-component of the ball's displacement and <i>y</i> =
   <i>h</i> the ball's elevation when the ball is at the peak of its
   trajectory.
 </p>
 <p>
   By the work-kinetic energy theorem, <i>W</i> should be equal to
   the change <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> in the ball's
   kinetic energy as the ball is going from <i>y</i> = 10 m to
   <i>y</i> = <i>h</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
   Thus,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>W</i> = -<i>mg</i>(<i>h</i> - 10 m) = <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
 </p>
 <p>
   Note that in the present case both sides of Eq.(3) are negative.
 </p>
 <p>
   Use Eq.(3) and the value of <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>
   found earlier to calculate <i>h</i>.  Then use the applet to
   determine <i>h</i> 'experimentally'. Compare the experimental value
   of <i>h</i> to the calculated value.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(f)</b> Repeat all of the above for a different mass, <i>m</i> =
   400 g.  Do you obtain a different value for <i>h</i>?
 </p>
 <p>
   Explain your result theoretically by replacing <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> in Eq.(3) by (<i>m</i>/2)<font
   face="symbol">D</font>(<i>v</i><sup>2</sup>).  Notice that the
   factor of <i>m</i> occurs on both sides of the equation and
   therefore can be canceled.  Projectile motion without air
   resistance does not depend on the mass of the object.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 2</b>. The purpose of Activity 2 is to use the
   work-kinetic energy theorem to predict the speed of a ball when the
   ball reaches the ground after having been thrown from a given point
   above the ground with a given speed at a given angle.  Air
   resistance is ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
   RESET the applet.  Set the parameters and the initial conditions at
   <i>t</i> = 0 for the ball to the same values as in Activity 1:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>
  </li>
  <li>
   mass of ball: <i>m</i> = 200 g
  </li>
  <li>
   (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)(0) = (10, 10) m
  </li>
  <li>
   speed: <i>v</i>(0) = 25 m/s
  </li>
  <li>
   launch angle: <font face="symbol">q</font>(0) = 30<sup>o</sup>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
   <u>Outline</u>
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(a)</b> Calculate <i>KE</i>(0).<br>
   <b>(b)</b> Play the motion until the ball reaches the ground at
   <i>y</i> = 0, observe both the displacement of the ball and the
   force acting on the ball, and determine the sign of the work
   <i>W</i>.<br>
   <b>(c)</b> Calculate <i>W</i>, and compare it to the value shown in
   the Data box.<br>
   <b>(d)</b> Equate <i>W</i> to <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>,
   and determine <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i>.<br>
   <b>(e)</b> From <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i>, determine
   <i>v<sub>ground</sub></i>.<br>
   <b>(f)</b> Repeat all of the above for a different mass.
 </p>
 <p>
   <u>Details</u>
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(a)</b> Use the value <i>KE</i>(0) of the ball's kinetic energy
   at <i>t</i> = 0 from Activity 1.  If you did not do Activity 1,
   calculate this value and compare your result with the value shown
   in the Data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(b)</b> PLAY the motion the motion, and PAUSE it when the ball
   reaches the ground level, which we will take to be at <i>y</i> = 0.
   Display both the ball's displacement and the force of gravity
   acting on the ball.  Observe that both vectors point in the same
   direction, downward, which means that the work done on the ball by
   the force of gravity while the ball is moving from <i>y</i> = 10 m
   to <i>y</i> = 0 is positive.
 </p>
 <p>
   Therefore, since the work done by gravity is the net work done on
   the ball, the work-kinetic energy theorem implies that the ball's
   kinetic energy must by greater at <i>y</i> = 0 than at <i>y</i> = 10
   m.  The same will be true for the ball's speed <i>v</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(c)</b> Calculate the net work <i>W</i> done on the ball during
   the ball's motion from <i>y</i> = 10 m to <i>y</i> = 0.  Eq.(1)
   above gives an expression for <i>W</i>.  However,
   <i>d<sub>y</sub></i> is not given by Eq.(2) in the present case.
   Compare your value for <i>W</i> to that shown in the Data box.
 </p>
  <p>
   <b>(d)</b> By the work-kinetic energy theorem, <i>W</i> should be
   equal to the change <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> in the
   ball's kinetic energy as the ball goes from <i>y</i> = 10 m to
   <i>y</i> = 0.
 </p>
 <p>
   Thus,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>W</i> = -<i>mg</i>(0 - 10 m) = <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> = <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i> -
   <i>KE</i>(0).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
 </p>
 <p>
   Note that in the present case the left-hand side of Eq.(4) is
   positive.  Therefore Eq.(4) implies that the kinetic energy of the
   ball is greater at ground level than at <i>y</i> = 10 m.
 </p>
 <p>
   Use Eq.(4) and the value of <i>KE</i>(0) found earlier to calculate
   <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i>.  Use the applet to determine
   <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i> 'experimentally'. Compare the experimental value of
   <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i> to the calculated value.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(e)</b> From <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i> calculate the value of
   the speed <i>v<sub>ground</sub></i> when the ball reaches <i>y</i>
   = 0.  Determine the value experimentally with the applet, and
   compare the calculated and experimental values.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(f)</b> Repeat all of the above for a different mass, <i>m</i> =
   400 g.  Do you obtain a different value for <i>h</i>?
 </p>
 <p>
   Explain your result theoretically by replacing
   <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i> and <i>KE</i>(0) in Eq.(4) by
   (<i>m</i>/2)<i>v</i><sup>2</sup><sub>ground</sub> and
   (<i>m</i>/2)<i>v</i><sup>2</sup>(0), respectively.
   Notice that the factor of <i>m</i> occurs on both sides of the
   equation and therefore can be canceled.  The free fall motion of
   objects does not depend on their mass.
