<div class="title">Activities on Work and Kinetic Energy in Free Fall</div>

 <p>
   The following Activities are for the 'Work and Energy in Projectile
   Motion' applet.  Make sure you know how the applet functions by
   consulting Help and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's Help
   menu.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 1</b>.  The purpose of Activity 1 is to use the
   work-kinetic energy theorem to predict the height a ball will reach
   that is thrown vertically upward with a given speed.  Air
   resistance is ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
   RESET the applet.  Set the following parameters and the following
   initial conditions at <i>t</i> = 0 for the ball:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>
  </li>
  <li>
   mass of ball: <i>m</i> = 200 g
  </li>
  <li>
   (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)(0) = (10, 10) m
  </li>
  <li>
   (<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>)(0) = (0, 25) m/s
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
   <b>(a)</b> Calculate <i>KE</i>(0).<br>
   <b>(b)</b> Determine <i>KE</i><sub>top</sub> and <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>.<br>
   <b>(c)</b> Compare the work <i>W</i> shown in the Data box to <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>.<br>
   <b>(d)</b> Calculate the force of gravity acting on the ball.<br>
   <b>(e)</b> From the work-kinetic-energy equation, <i>W</i> = <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>, calculate the height <i>h</i> of
   the ball's trajectory.<br>
   <b>(f)</b> Repeat all of the above for a different mass.
 </p>
 <p>
   <u>Details</u>
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(a)</b> Calculate the ball's kinetic energy <i>KE</i>(0) at
   <i>t</i> = 0.  Compare your result with the value shown in the Data
   box.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(b)</b> What is the ball's kinetic energy
   <i>KE</i><sub>top</sub> when the ball reaches maximum elevation, and
   what is the change <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> in kinetic
   energy of the ball from the initial instant at <i>t</i> = 0 until
   the ball reaches maximum elevation?
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(c)</b> PLAY the motion, and PAUSE it when the ball is at its
   maximum elevation, as nearly as you can.  You can STEP the ball up
   to this point and use a small step size when you get close. The
   Data box shows the ball's <i>y</i>-coordinate.  Watch it as you
   approach the top.  If you overshoot, REWIND the applet and
   PLAY/STEP to the top again.
 </p>
 <p>
	The Data box shows the value of the work <i>W</i> done on the ball
   by the force of gravity acting on the ball.  Since the force of
   gravity is the only force acting on the ball, <i>W</i> is equal to
   the net work done on the ball.  Is the work <i>W</i> done while the
   ball is moving to the top equal to the value of <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> you determined above, as required
   by the work-kinetic energy theorem?
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(d)</b> The force of gravity acting on the ball is constant
   throughout the ball's motion.  The applet will display it in green
   when you click the Force button.  Calculate the force of gravity
   acting on the ball, and compare your result with that shown in the
   Data box.  
 </p>
 <p>
	The Data box displays the components <i>F<sub>x</sub></i> and
   <i>F<sub>y</sub></i> of the force.  Note how the direction of the
   <i>y</i>-axis is defined in the applet and the corresponding sign
   of the <i>y</i>-component of the force of gravity.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(e)</b> When the ball moves from its initial elevation
   <i>y</i>(0) = 10 m to its maximum elevation <i>y<sub>max</sub></i>
   = <i>h</i>, its displacement <i>d<sub>y</sub></i> in the
   <i>y</i>-direction is equal to <i>h</i> - 10 m. You can display the
   ball's displacement vector (in blue) by clicking the Displacement
   button.  Note that the displacement is opposite to the force of
   gravity, which means that the work done by the force is negative.
 </p>
 <p>
   The net work <i>W</i> done on the ball during this displacement is
   equal to 
 </p>
 <p align="center">
  <i>W</i> = <i>F<sub>y</sub></i><i>d<sub>y</sub></i> =
   (-<i>mg</i>)<i>d<sub>y</sub></i> = -<i>mg</i>(<i>h</i> - 10
   m).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
 </p>
 <p>
   By the work-kinetic energy theorem, <i>W</i> should be equal to the
   change <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> in the ball's kinetic
   energy as the ball goes from <i>y</i> = 10 m to <i>y</i> =
   <i>h</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
   Thus,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>W</i> = -<i>mg</i>(<i>h</i> - 10 m) = <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
 </p>
 <p>
   Note that in the present case both sides of Eq.(2) are negative.
 </p>
 <p>
   Use Eq.(2) and the value of <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>
   found earlier to calculate <i>h</i>.  Then use the applet to
   determine <i>h</i> 'experimentally'. Compare the experimental value
   of <i>h</i> to the calculated value.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(f)</b> Repeat all of the above for a different mass, <i>m</i> =
   400 g.  Do you obtain a different value for <i>h</i>?
 </p>
 <p>
   Explain your result theoretically by replacing <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> in Eq.(2) by (<i>m</i>/2)<font
   face="symbol">D</font>(<i>v</i><sup>2</sup>), where <i>v</i> is the
   ball's speed.  Notice that the factor of
   <i>m</i> occurs on both sides of the equation and therefore can be
   canceled.  The free fall motion of objects does not depend on their
   mass.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 2</b>. The purpose of Activity 2 is to use the
   work-kinetic energy theorem to predict the speed of a ball when the
   ball reaches the ground after having been thrown vertically upward
   with a given speed from a given point above the ground.  Air
   resistance is ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
   RESET the applet.  Set the parameters and the initial conditions at
   <i>t</i> = 0 for the ball to the same values as in Activity 1:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>
  </li>
  <li>
   mass of ball: <i>m</i> = 200 g
  </li>
  <li>
   (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)(0) = (10, 10) m
  </li>
  <li>
   (<i>v<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>y</sub></i>)(0) = (0, 25) m/s
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
   <u>Outline</u>
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(a)</b> Calculate <i>KE</i>(0).<br>
	<b>(b)</b> Play the motion until the ball reaches the ground at
	<i>y</i> = 0, and observe both the displacement of the ball and the
	force acting on the ball.<br>
	<b>(c)</b> Calculate the net work <i>W</i> done on the ball and
	compare it to the value shown in the Data box.<br>
   <b>(d)</b> Equate <i>W</i> to <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i>,
   and determine <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i>.<br>
   <b>(e)</b> From <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i>, determine
   <i>v<sub>ground</sub></i>.<br>
   <b>(f)</b> Repeat all of the above for a different mass.
 </p>
 <p>
   <u>Details</u>
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(a)</b> Use the value <i>KE</i>(0) of the ball's kinetic energy
   at <i>t</i> = 0 from Activity 1.  If you did not do Activity 1,
   calculate this value and compare your result with the value shown
   in the Data box.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(b)</b> PLAY the motion the motion, and PAUSE it when the ball
   reaches the ground level, which we will take to be at <i>y</i> = 0.
   Display both the ball's displacement and the force of gravity
   acting on the ball.  Observe that both vectors point in the same
   direction, downward, which means that the work done on the ball by
   the force of gravity while the ball is moving from <i>y</i> = 10 m
   to <i>y</i> = 0 is positive.
 </p>
 <p>
   Therefore, since the work done by gravity is the net work done on
   the ball, the work-kinetic energy theorem implies that the ball's
   kinetic energy must by greater at <i>y</i> = 0 than at <i>y</i> = 10
   m.  The same will be true for the ball's speed <i>v</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(c)</b> Calculate the net work done on the ball during the
   ball's motion from <i>y</i> = 10 m to <i>y</i> = 0.  Compare your
   value to that shown in the Data box.
 </p>
  <p>
   <b>(d)</b> The net work <i>W</i> done on the ball during this
   displacement is equal to (-<i>mg</i>)<i>d<sub>y</sub></i> =
   -<i>mg</i>(0 - 10 m).  By the work-kinetic energy theorem,
   this should be equal to the change <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> in the ball's kinetic energy as the
   ball is going from <i>y</i> = 10 m to <i>y</i> = 0.
 </p>
 <p>
   Thus,
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>W</i> = -<i>mg</i>(0 - 10 m) = <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> = <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i> -
   <i>KE</i>(0).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
 </p>
 <p>
   Note that in the present case the left-hand side of Eq.(3) is
   positive. Therefore Eq.(3) implies that at ground level the kinetic
   energy is greater than at <i>y</i> = 10 m.
 </p>
 <p>
   Use Eq.(3) and the value of <i>KE</i>(0) found earlier to calculate
   <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i>.  Then use the applet to determine
   <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i> 'experimentally'. Compare the experimental value of
   <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i> to the calculated value.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(e)</b> From <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i> calculate the value of
   the speed <i>v<sub>ground</sub></i> when the ball reaches <i>y</i>
   = 0.  Determine the value experimentally with the applet, and
   compare the calculated and experimental values.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>(f)</b> Repeat all of the above for a different mass, <i>m</i> =
   400 g.  Do you obtain a different value for <i>h</i>?
 </p>
 <p>
   Explain your result theoretically by replacing
   <i>KE<sub>ground</sub></i> and <i>KE</i>(0) in Eq.(3) by
   (<i>m</i>/2)<i>v</i><sup>2</sup><sub>ground</sub> and
   (<i>m</i>/2)<i>v</i><sup>2</sup>(0), respectively.
   Notice that the factor of <i>m</i> occurs on both sides of the
   equation and therefore can be canceled.  The free fall motion of
   objects does not depend on their mass.
