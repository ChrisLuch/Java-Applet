<div class="title">Activities on Work and Kinetic Energy in a Binary Star System</div>

 <p>
   The following Activities are for the Binary Star System applet.
   Make sure you know how the applet functions by consulting Help,
   Assumptions, and ShowMe under Applet Help on the applet's Help
   menu.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 1</b>.  The purpose of Activity 1 is to observe the
   relationship between the stars' speeds and the kinetic energy
   <i>KE</i> of the binary star system.
 </p>
 <p>
   RESET the applet.  Display the stars' velocity vectors, but not any
   of the other vectors.
 </p>
 <p>
   Move the mouse pointer to the tip of the longer one of the two
   velocity arrows and, when the pointer changes to a cross-hair,
   click and drag the tip of the velocity vector until it points
   horizontally and has maximum length, as illustrated in Figure 1
   below.
 </p>
 <p>
   Measure this length by means of the ruler.  Place one end of the
   ruler at the center of the star where the vector's tail end is
   located and place the ruler's other end at the vector's tip, as
   illustrated in Figure 1.  Let's say the ruler gives the reading
   120 for the length of the vector.  Record the value of <i>KE</i>
   displayed in the bottom left corner of the applet window.
 </p>

   <b>Figure 1</b>
 <p>
	Also measure the length of the kinetic energy portion (red) of the
   energy column with the scale.  You can make it easier to read the
   scale by dragging the scale downward until its zero is lined up
   with the lower edge of the red portion of the energy column.  The
   <i>KE</i> value red with the scale should agree with the more exact
   numerical value displayed at the bottom to within the precision
   available on the scale.
 </p>
 <p>
   Now drag the end of the ruler that is located at the tip of the
   velocity vector back towards the center of the star until the ruler
   reads half of the original length, i.e., 60.  Then drag the tip of
   the velocity vector so that it coincides with the end of the ruler.
   The velocity vector's length is now 60 or close to it.
 </p>
 <p>
   Compare the value of the kinetic energy now to that recorded
   earlier.  It should be nearly one fourth of that recorded earlier
   because the kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the
   magnitude of the velocity and because this magnitude has been
   reduced to half its original value.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 2</b>.  The purpose of this Activity is to observe,
   qualitatively, how the work done on the stars by the gravitational
   forces acting on the stars is related to the change in the system's
   kinetic energy.
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <img src="BinaryStarActivity1.gif" alt="Force and Displacement">
 <br>
   <b>Figure 2</b>
 </p>
 <p>
   RESET the applet.  Display the stars' velocities and the
   gravitational forces acting on the stars, as in Figure 2 above.
   Adjust the velocities, by dragging the tip of one of the two
   velocity vectors, so that it forms an angle less than
   90<sup>o</sup> with the force vector for the same star, similar to
   what is shown in Figure 2.  Select the Trace button to have the
   stars' paths displayed when the motion starts.
 </p>
 <p>
   PLAY the motion. Observe the angle between the velocity vector of a
   star and the force vector for that star as the motion proceeds.  At
   the same time, observe how the kinetic energy of the system
   changes.  Try to express your observations in a few sentences.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Lesson</b>.  At first, while the stars are getting closer, the
   angle between the velocity and the force is less than
   90<sup>o</sup> and the motion is getting faster and the kinetic
   energy is increasing.  Later, when the stars are moving farther
   apart, the angle between the velocity and the force is greater than
   90<sup>o</sup> and the motion is slowing down and the kinetic
   energy decreasing.
 </p>
 <p>
   Remember that work is defined as the scalar product of force and
   displacement.  During an infinitesimal time interval <i>dt</i>, the
   displacement <i>d</i><img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r"
   align="bottom"> of a star is equal to <img src="v_orange.gif"
   alt="vector v" align="bottom"><i>dt</i> where <img
   src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v" align="bottom"> is the star's
   velocity.  Thus, the work <i>dW</i> done on one of the stars during
   an infinitesimal time interval <i>dt</i> by the gravitational force
   <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F" alt="bottom"> acting on the
   star is equal to
 </p>
 <p align="center"> 
   <i>dW</i> = <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
   alt="bottom"><img src="dot_orange.gif" alt="dot" alt="bottom"><img
   src="v_orange.gif" alt="vector v" alt="bottom"><i>dt</i> = <i>Fv
   cos</i> <font face="symbol">q</font> <i>dt</i>
 </p>
 <p>
   where <font face="symbol">q</font> is the angle between the force
   and the velocity.  If <font face="symbol">q</font> <
   90<sup>o</sup>, then <i>cos</i> <font face="symbol">q</font> > 0
   and therefore the work <i>dW</i> positive.  Note that the angle
   between the force and the velocity is either less or greater than
   90<sup>o</sup> for both stars at the same time, so that the work
   done on both stars is either positive or negative at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
   The applet shows that when positive work is being done on the
   system the total kinetic energy is increasing and when negative
   work is being done the total kinetic energy is decreasing.  This is
   the way it should be according to the work-kinetic energy theorem.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 3</b>.  The purpose of this activity is to investigate
   a motion in which no work is being done on the stars.
 </p>
 <p>
   RESET the applet.  Display the velocity and force vectors, and
   select the Trace button.
 </p>
 <p>
   The motion will be circular if the initial velocities are
   perpendicular to the line joining the two stars and if <i>KE</i> =
   0.5&times;|<i>PE</i>|.  The values of <i>KE</i> and <i>PE</i> are
   displayed near the bottom left corner of the applet window.  Adjust
   the initial velocities so that these conditions are met as nearly
   as you can.
 </p>
 <p>
   PLAY the motion, and observe the velocity and force vectors during
   the motion as well as the <i>KE</i> value.  In a few sentences,
   express what you observe and how it relates to the work-kinetic
   energy theorem.
 </p>
 <p>
   If the velocity and force vectors are perpendicular at all times,
   the scalar product of the two vectors is 0 at all times since
   <i>cos</i> 90<sup>o</sup> = 0.  In this case, no work is being done
   on the system and the work-kinetic energy theorem implies that the
   total kinetic energy of the system remains constant.
