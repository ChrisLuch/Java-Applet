<div class="title">Activities on Work and Kinetic Energy in Circular Motion</div>

 <p>
   The following Activities are for the 'Force and Energy in Circular
   Motion' applet.  Their purpose is to investigate the work-kinetic
   energy theorem in circular motion.  Make sure you know how the
   applet functions by consulting Help and ShowMe under Applet Help on
   the applet's Help menu.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Activity 1</b>.  The purpose of Activity 1 is to examine the
   case of uniform circular motion of a particle.
 </p>
    <p>
      RESET the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Display the velocity vector of the mass point and the net force
      acting on the mass point by selecting "velocity at particle" and
      "force" in the Vector Panel. Display the Data box.
    </p>
    <p>
      PLAY the motion, and observe that the force vector keeps
      pointing towards the center of the circle and is always at right
      angles to the velocity vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also observe that the red kinetic energy bar remains constant in
      height and, that the value of <i>KE</i>(<i>t</i>) in the Data
      box remains constant, and that the value of the work <i>W</i>
      done on the particle stays 0.
    </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Activity 2</b>.  Explain the observations from Exercise 1 in
      terms of the work-kinetic energy theorem.  In particular,
      explain why the work done on the particle is 0 when the net
      force acting on the particle is <b>not</b> zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Answer</b>.  The net work <i>W</i> done on the particle is 0
      because the net force <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
      align="bottom"> is at right angles to the velocity at any
      instant, and therefore at right angles to the particle's
      infinitesimal displacement <i>d</i><img src="r_orange.gif"
      alt="vector r" align="bottom"> during an infinitesimal time
      interval surrounding that instant.  Remember that the
      infinitesimal amount of net work <i>dW</i> during such an
      infinitesimal time interval is given by the scalar product
    </p>
    <p align="center">
       <i>dW</i> = <img src="F_orange.gif" alt="vector F"
      align="bottom"><img src= "dot_orange.gif" alt="dot"
      align="bottom"><i>d</i><img src="r_orange.gif" alt="vector r"
      align="bottom"> = <i>F</i>|<i>d</i><img src="r_orange.gif"
      alt="vector r" align="bottom">| cos</i> <font
      face="symbol">q</font>.<img src="small_orange.gif" alt="space"
      height="1" width="40">(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      If the angle <font face="symbol">q</font> between the net force
      and the displacement is 90<sup>o</sup> as in the present case,
      <i>dW</i> = 0 because <i>cos</i> 90<sup>o</sup> = 0.  If for
      each infinitesimal displacement the work <i>dW</i> is zero, the
      sum <i>W</i> of all the infinitesimal amounts of work for a finite
      displacement is zero as well.
    </p>
	 <p>
      According to the work-kinetic energy theorem, the net work
      <i>W</i> done on the particle is equal to the change in the
      particle's kinetic energy.  If <i>W</i> = 0, the change in
      kinetic energy of the particle is zero as well, which means that
      the particle's kinetic energy remains constant.
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 3</b>. The purpose of this Activity is to examine
      the case of non-uniform circular motion.
    </p>
	 <p><b>(a)</b> REWIND the applet. Set the
      <i>dv</i>/<i>dt</i>-slider to -0.05 m/s<sup>2</sup>.  Make sure
      the <i>v</i>(0)-slider is still at 0.20 m/s, that the Data box is
      displayed, as well as the velocity and force vectors.  Write
      down the value of the particle's kinetic energy at <i>t</i> = 0.
    </p>
	 <p> STEP the motion to time <i>t</i> = 0.90 s. Observe that the
      work done on the particle takes on increasingly negative values
      at each step and that the kinetic energy values are
      correspondingly decreasing.  The red kinetic energy bar is
      shrinking in height.
    </p>
	 <p>
      Write down the values of the net work <i>W</i> done on the
      particle and the particle's kinetic energy <i>KE</i> at <i>t</i>
      = 0.90 s.
    </p>
	 <p>
      Verify that these values together with the intial value of the
      kinetic energy at <i>t</i> = 0 satisfy the work-kinetic energy
      theorem,
    </p>
	 <p align="center">
      <i>W</i> = <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> .<img
      src="small_orange.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40">(2)
    </p>
	 <p>
      <b>(b)</b> PLAY the motion past time <i>t</i> = 0.90 s.  Wait
      until the kinetic energy is reduced to zero and the mass point's
      motion is momentarily halted.  Subsequently the mass point moves
      in the opposite direction with increasing kinetic energy.  The
      values of <i>W</i> are becoming less negative, reach 0 at the
      starting point of the motion, and become positive beyond that.
      Pause the motion at a moment when <i>W</i> is positive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, write down the values of <i>W</i> and <i>KE</i> for that
      moment as listed in the Data box, and verify that they satisfy
      Eq.(2) when combined with the value for the initial kinetic
      energy at <i>t</i> = 0.
    </p>
	 <p>
      Verify also that the work done from <i>t</i> = 0.90 s until the
      moment you stopped the motion is equal to the change in the
      particle's kinetic energy during that time interval.
	 </p>
	 <p>
      <b>(c)</b> Repeat the observations and calculations done in
      Parts (a) or (b) for a different set of initial conditions and
      parameter settings of the applet.
	 </p>
    <p>
      <b>Activity 4 (Challenge Activity)</b>.  RESET the applet.  In
      addition to the net force and velocity vectors, display the
      component vectors of the net force.  Set <i>dv</i>/<i>dt</i> to
      a non-zero value.  Write down all initial settings including the
      value of the initial kinetic energy.
     </p>
    <p>
      <b>(a)</b> PLAY the motion, and observe that the tangential
      component of the net force stays constant in magnitude. PAUSE
      the motion at some point, and check that its magnitude
      <i>F<sub>tan</sub></i>, which is displayed in the Data box, is
      equal to <i>m</i>|<i>dv</i>/<i>dt</i>|.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>(b)</b> Using only the values of the initial settings noted
      down earlier and the value of the time <i>t</i> at the moment
      you paused the motion, calculate the values of the net work
      <i>W</i> and of the kinetic energy <i>KE</i> of the particle at
      the moment you paused the motion.  Verify that the work-kinetic
      energy theorem is satisfied.
    </p>
