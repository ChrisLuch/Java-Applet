      Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem Applied to Projectile Motion
    </div>
	 <p>
     The applet on Page 2 lets you investigate the application of the
     work-kinetic energy theorem to projectile motion without air
     resistance.  For details on how to use the applet, please go to
     Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
	 </p>
    <p>
      When experimenting with the applet, open the item "Activities"
      under Related Items for suggestions on investigations to be
      carried out with the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may find it useful to have a copy of the Work-Kinetic Energy
      Theorem in front of you while working with the applet.  You may
      want to copy the statement below.  A statement of the theorem is
      also available under Related Items.

      <b>Work-kinetic energy theorem for a single particle</b>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The net work <i>W</i> done on a particle during a
      given time interval by the net force <img src="F.gif"
                  alt="vector F" align="bottom">
                  acting on the particle is equal to the change in
                  the particle's kinetic energy during that time
                  interval. In symbols,

      </p>
      <p>
        is the particle's kinetic energy, <i>m</i> the mass of the
        particle and <i>v</i> the speed of the particle.
