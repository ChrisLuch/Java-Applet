      Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem

      <b>The applet on Page 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the applet on Page 2 to investigate the work-kinetic
      energy theorem as it applies to a system consisting of two
      particles.  The general theorem for a system of <i>N</i>
      particles is stated below.  For more information on the
      work-kinetic energy theorem, see the information under Related
      Items.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system of two "particles" in the applet on Page 2 is a
      binary star system. Open "Activities" under Related Items for
      suggestions on what to investigate with the applet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Details on how to use the applet are available under Applet
      Help on the applet's Help menu.

      <b>The work-kinetic energy theorem for a system of particles</b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Let there be a system consisting of <i>N</i> particles, labeled 1
    to <i>N</i>. Let us consider some time interval during
    which the net force <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
    align="bottom"><sub>1</sub> acting on Particle 1 does work
    <i>W</i><sub>1</sub> on Particle 1 and the kinetic energy of
    Particle 1 changes by <font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i><sub>1</sub>.  Similarly for
    Particles 2 to <i>N</i>.
    </p>     
    <p>
      The general work-kinetic energy theorem states that
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>W</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>W</i><sub>2</sub> + ... +
      <i>W<sub>N</sub></i> = <font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i><sub>1</sub> + <font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i><sub>2</sub> + ... + <font
    face="symbol">D</font><i>KE<sub>N</sub></i>.<img src="small.gif"

      <u>Comment</u>. In general, the work listed on the left-hand
      side of Eq.(1) contains work done both by internal and external
      forces.  In the applet on Page 2, there are two internal forces
      doing work on the system.  There are no external forces acting
      on the system in the applet.  There are other systems in which
      there are only external forces doing work.  Finally, there are
      systems with both internal and external forces doing work.
