      Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem
    </div>
    <p>
      In contrast to the applets on Pages 2, 4, and 6, each of
      which involves a particle subject to a constant force, the
      applet on Page 8 involves a particle subject to a
      non-constant force. The force is either:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        varying in direction, but not in magnitude,
      </li>
      <li>
        varying both in direction and magnitude.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The force always varies in a manner such that the particle
      moves in a circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Details on how to use the applet on Page 8 are available under
      Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open "Activities Page 8" under Related Items for suggestions on
      what to investigate with the applet.
