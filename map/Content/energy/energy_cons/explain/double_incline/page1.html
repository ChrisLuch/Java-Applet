<div class="title">Energy Conservation on a Double Incline</div>


<p>Suppose we want to study the acceleration of the blocks in the
system shown on the left.  The system is frictionless.  Thus, the
system's energy is conserved.  You will learn how to use this
principle to determine the accelerations of the two blocks.</p>

<p>Click START to observe the motion.  You can stop the motion at any
point.  Determine the blocks' acceleration from the data that are
printed on the screen.  When done, go on to page 2 to check your
measurement.
