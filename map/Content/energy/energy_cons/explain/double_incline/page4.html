<p><b><center>What is the Acceleration?</center></b>

<p>Did you notice that for some settings the left block accelerates up
the incline, for others down the incline?  If not, you may want to
experiment with the system some more.  Also, can you find settings for
which the acceleration is zero?

<p>Since the acceleration can be in two directions, we need to define
axes for the inclines (see the z-axes in the diagram) and work with
the acceleration component a<sub>z</sub>.  The way the two z-axes are
chosen, a<sub>z</sub> will have the same sign for both blocks.
