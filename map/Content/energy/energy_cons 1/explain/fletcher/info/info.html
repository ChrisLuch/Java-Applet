<p>The simulated system has no friction: there is friction neither
between block 1 and the table surface nor in the pulley.  The
magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity used in the calculations
is <i>g</i> = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>  

<p>You can observe the following quantities, both during the motion of
the system and when the system is at rest:</p>

<p>

<ul>

<li><u>magnitude of acceleration of the blocks</u> - printed out as
<i>a</i></li>

<li><u>tensions in the strings on either side of the pulley</u> -
click the fbd button, <img src="fbdbutton.jpg">, to display the
free-body diagrams for both blocks and to have the two tensions
printed out as <i>T<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>T<sub>2</sub></i></li>

<li><u>free-body diagrams for the two blocks</u> - click the fbd
button, <img src="fbdbutton.jpg"></li>

<li><u>speed of the blocks</u> - printed out as <i>v</i> and shown by
a speedometer in the control panel labeled <i>v</i></li>

<li><u>time elapsed</u> - printed out as <i>t</i></li>

<li><u>elevation of block 2</u> - printed out as <i>h</i> on the
scale</li>

<li><u>kinetic energies of blocks 1 and 2 and of the pulley</u> -
printed out as <i>KE</i> with appropriate subscript</li>

<li><u>gravitational potential energy of block 2</u> - printed out as
<i>PE<sub>2</sub></i></li>

<li><u>total energy</u> - printed out as <i>E</i> (=
<i>KE<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>KE<sub>2</sub></i> +
<i>KE<sub>pulley</sub></i> + <i>PE<sub>2</sub></i>)

<br><b>note</b>: the individual energies are also represented
graphically by an energy bar; the different energies are identified
by color-coding.</li>

</ul>

<p>You have the following controls available:

<ul>

<li><u>reset and repeat</u> - clicking the RESET button restores the
applet to its default setting; clicking the REPEAT button restores the
applet to the initial setting chosen by the user; the user can change
settings only after either RESET or REPEAT</li>

<li><u>mass <i>m<sub>2</sub></i> of block 2</u> - use the first slider; the
mass of block 1 is fixed at 600 g</li>

<li><u>moment of inertia <font face="symbol"><i>I</i></font> of the
pulley</u> - use the second slider; the radius of the pulley is fixed
at 0.5 m</li>

<li><u>positions of the blocks</u> - drag block 1 (not block 2);<br>
<b>note</b>: while the blocks are being dragged, the values of the
speed, acceleration and tensions are indicated by question marks (or
stippled lines for the tensions in the fbd's) because these values
would depend on how block 1 is being dragged</li>

<li>elevation of the support platform for block 2</u> - drag the
platform up or down; 

<br><b>note</b>: upon start of the motion, the platform will
automatically move down 1 pixel and the motion will be frozen at the
level where the platform was set initially; this makes it clear that
the speed and tensions displayed when block 2 reaches the platform
belong to an instant while the block is still moving just before it
makes contact with the platform</li>

<li><u>running and pausing the animation</u> - click the PLAY/PAUSE
toggle button</li>

<li><u>stepping through the animation</u> - click the STEP button</li>

<li><u>reset and repeat</u> - clicking the RESET button restores the
applet to its default setting; clicking the REPEAT button restores the
applet to the initial setting chosen by the user; the user can change
settings only after either RESET or REPEAT.</li>

</ul>
