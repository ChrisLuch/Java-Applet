<p><b><center>What is the Acceleration?</center></b>

<p>If the block on the left accelerates down its incline, i.e., in the
negative z-direction, the acceleration component a<sub>z</sub> is
negative.  Otherwise, positive.

<p>Now, on a sheet of paper, write down an expression for the
mechanical energy E of the system at an instant when the two blocks
have speed v (their speeds are the same if the string does not
stretch) and have vertical elevations h<sub>1</sub> and h<sub>2</sub>,
measured from some reference level.

<p>When done, go to page 6 to compare.
