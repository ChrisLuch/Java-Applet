<p><b><center>What is the Acceleration?</center></b>  

<p><b>Strategy</b>

<p>Let the system consist of the blocks, pulley, string, incline, and
earth.

<p>The system has no friction, so its mechanical energy is
conserved.  The mechanical energy consists of the kinetic energies of
the two blocks and the gravitional potential energies of the block
1/earth and block 2/earth pairs.  (The pulley's mass and, therefore, its
kinetic energy are zero.)

<p>Energy conservation leads to an equation relating the change of
the square of the blocks' speed and the displacement.  This equation
is a standard one from kinematics containing the acceleration.
