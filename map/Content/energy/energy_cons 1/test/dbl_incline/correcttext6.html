<p><b><center>What is the Acceleration?</center></b>

<p>We have now derived the following expression for a<sub>z</sub>:

<p><center>a<sub>z</sub> = -[ (m<sub>1</sub>/M) sin <font
face="symbol"> a</font> - (m<sub>2</sub>/M) sin<font
face="symbol"> b</font> ] g.</center>

<p>Substituting the given values gives, since M = 0.6 + 0.4 = 1.0 kg,

<p><center>a<sub>z</sub> = -[0.6 sin 30<sup>o</sup> - 0.4 sin
60<sup>o</sup>] = 0.45 m s<sup>-2</sup>.</center>

<p>Since a<sub>z</sub> is positive, the left block accelerates up the
incline.

<p><b>Thinking about the answer</b>

<p>The dimensions of the expression for a<sub>z</sub> should be those
of acceleration.  That is obviouslious the case because of the factor
of g.  The ratios of the masses and the sine functions are
dimensionless.

<p>The signs make sense as well.  The term involving m<sub>1</sub>
should cause the acceleration to be negative.  It does that.
Similarly the term involving m<sub>2</sub> should cause the
acceleration to be positive, which it does.

<p>You can also check some limiting cases.  E.g., if m<sub>1</sub> =
0, <font face="symbol">a</font> = 0, and <font face="symbol">b</font>
= 90<sup>o</sup>, the acceleration should be equal to g.  The equation
for a<sub>z</sub> gives this answer.

<p>You can now experiment with the simulation for arbitrary angles of
the inclines and masses of the blocks, observe the acceleration, and
check the equation above against the observed values.
