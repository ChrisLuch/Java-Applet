    <div class="title">Energy Conservation in Fletcher's Trolley</div>
    <div class="title">Activities</div>

    <p><b>Preparation</b>: Energy/Energy Conserv'n/Explain It/Fletcher's
    Trolley.</p>

    <p><b>Exercise 1</b>. Set block 2 to some initial height and the
    platform below block 2 to some final height.  Set the masses of the
    two blocks.  Then allow block 2 to drop from rest from the initial
    height to the platform.</P> 

    <p>The system is frictionless.</p>

    <p>Predict how the total mechanical energy <i>E</i> of the system
    and the potential energy and the kinetic energies will vary during
    the motion of the blocks, and then observe what happens in the
    simulation.</p>

    <p>Repeat this with different masses for the blocks, and also with a
    massive pulley.</p>

    <p><b>Exercise 2</b>. Carry out the following calculations.</P>     
                                                                          
    <p>1. Using energy conservation, and the values of the masses of the
    blocks and the vertical displacement of block 2, predict the speed
    of block 2 just before the block hits the platform.  Compare your
    value with that shown by the applet.</p>
                                                                
    <p>2. From the final speed found in Part 1, and the masses of the
    blocks and the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity,
    determine the magnitude of the acceleration of the two
    blocks. Compare your value with that shown by the applet.</p>
                                                                                                      
    <p>Repeat Parts 1 and 2 with a massive pulley.  The moment of
    inertia of the pulley and the radius of the pulley are indicated on
    the pulley slider.</p>
