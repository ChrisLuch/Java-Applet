    <div class="title">Energy and Orbits</div>

    <p>The Applet on Page 2 shows satellite motion and projectile motion
    in the earth's gravitational field. The gravitational potential
    energy of the satellite-earth system or projectile-earth system along
    with the satellite's or projectile's kinetic energy and the total
    mechanical energy of the system are simulated.

    <p>The projectile's or satellite's initial position and velocity can
    be varied.  The viewpoint can be changed from a point close to the
    earth's surface, best for projectile motion, to a point far from the
    earth's surface, best for satellite motion.

    <p>Detailed information on how to use the applet is available from
    Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
