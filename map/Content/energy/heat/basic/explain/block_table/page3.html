    <p>
      In the block-table system simulated by the applet on Page 2, the
      only kind of external energy transfer to this system is the work
      <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> done by the applied force. In the special
      case in which the block is moving with constant velocity, when the
      applied force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to
      the friction force, there is no change in the system's mechanical
      energy.  The block's kinetic energy stays constant at a non-zero
      value and the table's kinetic energy remains constant at 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      If kinetic energy were the only energy of the block-table system,
      we would have an example of energy <b>non</b>-conservation: energy
      is transferred into the system without a corresponding increase in
      system energy.  However, according to the principle of energy
      conservation, it must be possible to define the total energy of the
      block-table system so that the change in this energy is equal to
      <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is accomplished by defining an <i>internal energy</i> of the
      block-table system.  Physically, this internal energy is related to
      how "warm" the system is.  The symbol for internal energy is
      <i>U</i>.  The total energy of the block-table system is the sum of
      the kinetic and internal energy, <i>KE</i> + <i>U</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is no change in the system's kinetic energy, one defines
      the internal energy simply by requiring its change <font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> to satisfy the energy conservation
      equation
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> = <font face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i>,<img

      src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="5"> <font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> = 0.<img src="small.gif"
      alt="space" height="1" width="40">(1)
    </p>
    <p>
      More generally, if the kinetic energy <i>KE</i> of the block-table
      system is changing, one defines <font
      face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> by
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> = <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> +
      <font face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i>.<img src="small.gif"
      alt="space" height="1" width="40">(2)
    </p>
    <p>
      Eqs.(1) and (2) assume that no other energy is being transferred to
      the system, e.g., heat.  An example of heat energy transfer is heat
      conduction from the block or table to the surrounding air.  Here we
      are assuming that such heat conduction is negligible.  Otherwise,
      it must be included in the equations above.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of the molecular model, the internal energy of a body can
      be explained as the mechanical energy of the molecules constituting
      the body, both their kinetic energies and the potential energies of
      interaction between the molecules.
