    <div class="title">Thermal Energy or Internal Energy</div>

    <p>
      The terms <i>thermal energy</i> and <i>internal energy</i> are
      taken to mean the same thing here.  "Internal energy" is the
      standard technical term while "thermal energy" is perhaps a bit
      more colloquial.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose a block is sliding on a horizontal table with friction.  An
      applied horizontal force <img src="F.gif" alt="vector F"
      align="bottom"><sub>appl</sub> is acting on the block.  The applied
      force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the
      friction force so that the net force acting on the block is zero
      and the block is moving with constant velocity.  Figure 1 below
      illustrates these conditions with an image taken with the applet on
      Page 2 at time
      <i>t</i> = 0.
    </p>
    <p align="center">

      <b>Figure 1</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The table surface is represented as an <i>x</i>-axis pointing to
      the right.  The "velocitometer" shows the <i>x</i>-component of the
      block's velocity to be 2.0 m/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we freeze the motion at <i>t</i> = 1.16 s.  Figure 2 below
      shows data from the applet's data box pertaining to this instant
      and energy bars corresponding to the instants <i>t</i> = 0 and
      <i>t</i> = 1.16 s.
    </p>
    <p align="center">

    <br>
      <b>Figure 2</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The work <i>W<sub>appl</sub></i> done on the block by the applied
      force during the 1.16-s time interval is equal to 22.74 J and
      represented by the purple bar in the box for <i>t</i> = 1.16 s.
      The kinetic energy has not changed during this time interval
      because the block's speed is constant.  Where did the energy go
      that has been supplied in the form of applied work?
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this energy was converted into <i>internal energy</i> of the
      block-table system.  Both the block and the table are getting a bit
      warmer in the process.  The internal energy of the block-table
      system is denoted by the symbol <i>U</i>.  The data box shows that
      the change <font face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> in this internal
      energy during the 1.16-s time interval is 22.74 J, exactly the same
      as the amount of applied work done.  The green bar representing
      <font face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> in the energy box for <i>t</i>
      = 1.16 s has exactly the same height as the purple bar representing
      the applied work done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go to Page 2 to repeat this experiment with the applet yourself.
      Take the block's mass to be 5.0 kg, set the kinetic coefficient of
      friction to 0.20, set the magnitude of the applied force to 9.8 N,
      and set the velocity to 2.0 m/s.  This reproduces the conditions on
      which Figures 1 and 2 are based.
