 <div class="title">Thermal Energy or Internal Energy</div>

 <p>
   The terms "thermal energy" and "internal energy" mean the same
   thing.  "Thermal energy" is more colloquial while "internal energy"
   is the technical term.
 </p>
 <p>
   In terms of the molecular model of matter, the <i>internal
	energy</i> of a body or system is the internal mechanical energy of
	the molecules constituting the body or system.  If a body is at
	rest, this "internal mechanical energy" of the molecules is the sum
	the kinetic energy of the molecules and the potential energy of
	interaction between the molecules.
 </p>
 <p>
	If a body has "macroscopic" motion, which could be translational
   motion or rotational motion or both, not all of the kinetic energy
   of its molecules contributes to the internal energy.  E.g., if the
   body is carrying out translational motion, the macroscopic kinetic
   energy associated with such motion, equal to <i>M</i>/2
   <i>V</i><sup>2</sup>, must be subtracted from the total kinetic
   energy of the molecules to get the internal kinetic energy.  Here
   <i>M</i> is the body's mass and <i>V</i> the speed of the body's
   center of mass.
 </p>
 <p>
   The molecular model cannot be used to measure the internal energy
   of a body because one never knows the positions and velocities of
   the molecules inside the body.  One needs a macroscopic definition
   of the internal energy to be able to measure internal energy.
 </p>
 <p>
   Macroscopically, the <i>internal energy</i> of a body or system is
   defined as follows. The definition assumes that the body or system
   is thermally isolated from its environment.  To imagine thermal
   isolation, think of a thick padding of styrofoam surrounding the
   body or system.  (In a careful theoretical development, one needs
   to define thermal isolation differently.)  Then only work-like
   interactions between the body or system and its environment are
   possible.
 </p>
 <p>
	Suppose an amount of work <i>W</i> is done on the body or system in
	a work-like interaction with the environment and that the body or
	system is at rest, both before and after this interaction has
	process, then the <b>change</b> <font
	face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> in the body's or system's internal
	energy resulting from the interaction is defined as
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <font face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i> = <i>W</i>,<img

   rest.<img src="small.gif" alt="space" height="1" width="40">(1)
 </p>
 <p>
   Examples of work-like interaction are rubbing the surface of an
   object, stirring a liquid (if the system consists of a container
   with a liquid inside it), and compressing a gas in a cylinder.
 </p>
 <p>
   <u>Comment 1</u>.  Underlying this definition of internal energy is
   the principle of energy conservation.  The principle implies that
   if energy is transferred to a system by means of work, then it must
   be possible to define an energy for the system such that the
   system's energy increases by an amount equal to the energy
   transferred.
 </p>
 <p>
   <u>Comment 2</u>. Eq.(1) defines the <b>change</b> in internal
   energy of the body or system in a process that takes the body or
   system from an initial state to a final state.  One is free to
   assign an arbitrary value to the internal energy for a suitable
   initial state.  Eq.(1) then determines the internal energy
   associated with any other state of the body or system.
 </p>
 <p>
   <u>Comment 3</u>.  One must check experimentally that the same
   amount of work, no matter in what form the work is done, always
   brings about the same final system state starting from a given
   initial system state.  Only if this is true, is it possible to use
   Eq.(1) to assign a unique internal energy value to a given state of
   a system. 
 </p>
 <p>
   The first quantitative experiments like this were done by
   J.P. Joule in the 19th century.  The SI-unit of energy, the joule,
   is named after him.  
 </p>
 <p>
	The fact that, given thermal isolation, the same amount of work is
   required to take a system from one state to another, no matter what
   the process is in which the work is delivered, is called the
   <i>first law of thermodynamics</i>.
 </p>
 <p>
   <u>Comment 4</u>.  If the body or system on which work is being
   done changes its macroscopic kinetic energy during the process of
   work-like interaction with the environment, Eq.(1) must be
   generalized to
 </p>
 <p align="center">
   <i>W</i> = <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> + <font
   face="symbol">D</font><i>U</i><img src="small.gif" alt="space"
   height="1" width="40">(2)
 </p>
 <p>
   where <font face="symbol">D</font><i>KE</i> is the change in the
   body's or system's kinetic energy.
