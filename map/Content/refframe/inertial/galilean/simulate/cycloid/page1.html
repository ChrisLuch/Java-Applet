        <div class="title">Rolling Motion</div>

        <p>The simulation on Page 2 shows the motion of a point fixed on a
        rolling spool.  The motion of the point is the superposition of the
        revolving and translating motions of the spool.  This kind of a motion
        is called <i>cycloidal motion</i>.  The spool point's motion can be
        understood in terms of the Galilean transformations of position and
        velocity.</p>

        <p>Detailed information on how the applet functions and a lesson with
        exercises to be carried out with the applet are available under Applet
        Help from the applet's Help menu.</p>
