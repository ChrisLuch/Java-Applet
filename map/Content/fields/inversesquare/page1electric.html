    <div class="title">Electric Field Outside and Inside a Uniform
    Sphere</div>

    <p>The Applet on Page 2 simulates the electric field outside and
    inside a sphere of uniform charge density.  In another mode, the applet
    simulates the gravitational field outside and inside a sphere of uniform
    mass density.

    <p>The applet will be loaded in its default mode, which is the
    Gravitational mode.  To set it to the Electric mode, click the radio
    button labeled "Electric".

    <p>Detailed information on how to use the applet is available from
    Applet Help on the applet's Help menu.
