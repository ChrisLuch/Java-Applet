  <div class="title">The CANU Content Management System</div>

  <p>
    The CANU (Content Arranging and Navigating Utility) system has
    three parts: an <i>Arranger</i> for arranging content material
    into packages called "courses", a <i>Navigator</i> for going
    through the content of the courses available in CANU, and an
    <i>Administrator</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are currently using the Navigator of the CANU content
    management system.  A User's Guide for the CANU Navigator is
    available from the Content menu <img src="ContentMenuIcon.gif"
    alt="Content Menu Icon" align="bottom"> in the top left corner of
    the CANU Navigator window.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a User's Guide for the CANU Arranger go to CANU/CANU Arranger.
  </p>

  <p>
    The CANU Administrator allows adding and changing the password for
    a course, adding instructors to the system who have permission to
    work with the Arranger, assigning edit privileges for a course,
    deleting courses, etc.  One can also use the CANU Administrator to
    "export" a course in xml format.  In this format, a course can be
    "imported" by the CANU Admistrator of a CANU system on another
    server.  This makes it very easy for courses in the CANU system to
    be exchanged between different institutions.
  </p>
 
  <p>
    CANU stores only the metadata for a course, not the actual content
    files. The metadata include the URL's of the content files.  The
    content files themselves could reside on any webserver anywhere on
    the web.
