<div class="title">Kirchhoff's Laws</div>

<p><b>Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (Loop Rule)</b> says that the sum of the
potential differences encountered in going around a closed loop in an
electric circuit is equal to zero.</p>

<p>Going clockwise around the the loop from A to B to C and through
the battery back to A, we encounter the following potential
changes.</p>

<p><u>A to B</u>:  <i>V<sub>B</sub></i> - <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> = -<i>R<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub></i></p>

<p><u>B to C</u>:  <i>V<sub>C</sub></i> - <i>V<sub>B</sub></i> = <i>R<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub></i></p>

<p><u>C to A</u>:  <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> - <i>V<sub>C</sub></i> = 12 V</p>

<p>The signs to be placed in front of the <i>RI</i>-products are
determined as follows.  <b>Pretend</b> the currents are
actually in the directions indicated by the arrows and therefore
<b>pretend</b> that the currents are positive.</p>

<p>Let's start with the first term.  Since the positive direction is
from A across resistor <i>R<sub>1</sub></i> to B, we assume the
current in <i>R<sub>1</sub></i> to be in this direction.  Since the
direction of a current is always from high to low potential, the
potential at A must be higher than that at B.  Therefore, the
<b>change</b> in potential as one goes from A to B must be negative.
This accounts for the minus sign in the term
-<i>R<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>. What if the current direction is actually in the
opposite direction, i.e., from B to A?  Would the sign in front of
<i>R<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub></i> have to be plus rather than
minus?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  No, we still need the minus sign!  If the current
were directed from B to A, it would be negative because the current
direction would be opposite to the chosen positive direction, and
-<i>R<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub></i> would have a <b>positive</b> value.
This would be correct because, if the current were from B to A, the
potential would be greater at B than at A.  Thus, the <b>change</b> in
potential in going from A to B would be positive, as would be the
value of -<i>R<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub></i>.</p>

<p>To understand the sign in front of the term
<i>R<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub></i>, we assume that <i>I<sub>2</sub></i>
is directed from C to B through resistor <i>R<sub>2</sub></i> and
therefore positive. The potential at C must then be greater than that
at B making the change in potential when going from B to C positive,
as is value of the product <i>R<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub></i>.</p>
