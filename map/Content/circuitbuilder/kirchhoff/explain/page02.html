<div class="title">Kirchhoff's Laws</div>

<p><b>Kirchhoff's Current Law</b> says that the sum of the currents
going into a junction is equal to the sum of the currents leaving the
junction.</p>  

<p>Using this law seems to require that one knows which currents are
entering a given junction and which ones are leaving it.  It turns out
one doesn't need to know this, and we will now see why.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>. In the circuit on the left, which currents are
entering junction B?  Note the polarity of the battery.</p>

<p>Although in the present case it is not hard to predict that the
current in branch 1 (the branch containing R<sub>1</sub>) is entering
junction B and the currents in branches 2 and 3 are leaving the
junction (as shown in the animation), in other circuits one will know the
current directions only <b>after</b> solving the circuit problem.</p> 

<p>In general then, how can one write down an expression for the sum of
the currents entering a junction, if one does not know which currents are
the ones entering the junction?</p>

<p>This difficulty can be circumvented by <b>inventing</b> positive
directions in each of the branches of the circuit.  These positive
directions are <b>not</b> the same as the directions of the currents
in the branches!  (By 'current' we always mean <b>conventional</b>
current.)</p>

<p><b>Question</b>. How does the choice of a positive direction in a
branch help in setting up the Kirchhoff Current Law equation?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  Once a direction in a branch has been chosen as the
positive one, we give the current in that branch a positive value if
the current is in the positive direction and a negative value if in the
opposite direction.  On Page 3 it will be explained how this helps in
setting up the Kirchhoff Current Law equation.</p>

<p><b>Choose</b> positive directions for each of the three branches in
the circuit on the left. The simulation will allow you to indicate
your choices.  Here is how.</p>

<p>Click on the Select Tool (the one with the arrow icon), then on a
wire segment, then on one of the two direction arrows in the display
table below the applet.  This will add arrows to all wire segments in
the branch indicating the positive direction.  You can reverse this
direction or have no direction displayed by clicking on the other
direction arrow or the dash while the wire segment is selected.</p>

<div>On Page 3, we will take the positive directions in the three
branches as follows:</div>

<ul>

<li>to the right through resistor R<sub>1</sub>,</li> 

<li>upward through resistor R<sub>2</sub>,</li>

<li>downward through resistor R<sub>3</sub>.</li>

</ul>

<div>Try to set these directions using the procedure described
above.</div>

<p><b>Question</b>. With these conventions, which of the currents in
the three branchces are positive, which ones negative?

<p>If you have chosen the branch directions as suggested above, the
currents in branches 1 and 3 will have positive values and the current
in branch 2 a negative value.  Ammeters inserted into the branches
will show these values.  (In the simulation, ammeters will always show
positive values when no direction has been assigned to a branch.)</p>

<p>The reason the current in branch 2 has a negative value is that the
current direction, which is downward, is opposite to the assigned
(upward) positive direction.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b>.  Choosing a direction in a branch is like choosing
an axis when describing the motion of a particle.  If the particle is
moving east and we choose an x-axis that points east, the particle's
velocity will be represented by a positive number.  If we choose the
x-axis to point west, the same velocity will be represented by a
negative number.</p>

<p>Before going on to Page 3, think about how the trick of assigning
positive directions to branches and, accordingly, positive or negative
values to currents may help in writing down the Kirchhoff's Current
Law equations.  An answer will be given on Page 3.</p>
