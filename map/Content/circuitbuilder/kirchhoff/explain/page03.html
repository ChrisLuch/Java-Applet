<div class="title">Kirchhoff's Laws</div>

<p><b>Write down</b> Kirchhoff's Junction Rule (current law) applied
at junction B, <b>pretending</b> the currents are in the positive
directions indicated in the simulation.  (The current in branch 2 is
in the negative direction!) This gives the equation</p>

<div class="equation"><i>I<sub>1</sub></i> + <i>I<sub>2</sub></i> =
<i>I<sub>3</sub></i>.</div>

<p>Here, <i>I<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>I<sub>3</sub></i> are the currents
in branches 1 to 3, respectively.  In accordance with the chosen
branch directions, we pretend currents <i>I<sub>1</sub></i> and
<i>I<sub>2</sub></i> are entering the junction and
<i>I<sub>3</sub></i> is leaving the junction.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  How can this equation be correct, knowing that
the current in branch 2 is really leaving the junction?  Should this
current not be on the right-hand side of the equation?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  We can rearrange the equation above to</p>

<p class="equation"><i>I<sub>1</sub></i> = (-<i>I<sub>2</sub></i>) +
<i>I<sub>3</sub></i>.</p>

<p><i>I<sub>2</sub></i> has a negative value because it is downward
and therefore in the negative direction.  Thus (-<i>I<sub>2</sub></i>)
is positive.  Therefore, all three terms in the preceding equation are
positive, and it is clear that this is a correct equation.  On the
left-hand side we have the only current entering junction B and on the
right-hand side we have the two currents leaving the junction, and all
three currents are represented by their (positive) magnitudes,
<i>I<sub>1</sub></i>, (-<i>I<sub>2</sub></i>), and
<i>I<sub>3</sub></i>.  Inventing arbitrary positive directions and
<b>pretending</b> the currents are in these directions has given a
correct equation!</p>


<p><b>Question</b>. What about the corresponding equation for junction
C?  Write it down.  You will find that it leads to the same
equation.</p>

<p>We now have one equation for three currents.  In order to be able
to calculate the three currents, we need two more equations, so that
we have a total of 3 equations for 3 unknowns.  The two other
equations are provided by Kirchhoff's Loop Rule (voltage law) applied
to two different loops in the circuit.</p>

<p>Try to <b>write down</b> the loop equation for the loop consisting
of branches 1 and 2.  When done, go on to Page 4 to compare.</p>
