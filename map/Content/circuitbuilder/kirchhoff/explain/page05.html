<div class="title">Kirchhoff's Laws</div>

<p>We have established that going clockwise around the the loop from A
to B to C and through the battery back to A, we encounter the
following potential changes.</p>

<p><u>A to B</u>:  <i>V<sub>B</sub></i> - <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> = -<i>R<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub></i></p>

<p><u>B to C</u>:  <i>V<sub>C</sub></i> - <i>V<sub>B</sub></i> = <i>R<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub></i></p>

<p><u>C to A</u>:  <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> - <i>V<sub>C</sub></i> = 12 V</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  Can you write down the equation implied by
Kirchhoff's Voltage Law for this loop, using these voltage
expressions?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  Kirchhoff's Voltage Law says that the sum of the
potential changes around a closed loop is equal to zero.  Thus, the
sum of the three terms above must be zero,</p>

<p class="equation">-<i>R<sub>1</sub>I<sub>1</sub></i> +
<i>R<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub></i> + 12 V = 0.</p>

<p>We need a second loop equation.  It can be obtained by applying the
Voltage Law to the loop from B to C and back to B, say, in a clockwise
sense.  (You could also get a valid equation by going in the opposite
sense.  This equation would differ by an overall minus sign from the
other equation.)  Try to <b>write down</b> this equation.  When done,
go to Page 6 to compare.</p>
