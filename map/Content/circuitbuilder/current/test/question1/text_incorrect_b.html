<div class="title">Incorrect</div>

<p>
You picked choice (b), saying that bulbs <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> will
burn equally bright.
</p>

<p>Hint: In the top circuit, bulb A is in a series with a single bulb,
identical to A.  In the bottom circuit, bulb B is in series with a
parallel combination of two bulbs identical to B (and A).
</p>

<p>What is the resistance of these two bulbs in parallel?  Is it
greater than, equal to, or less than that of a single bulb?
