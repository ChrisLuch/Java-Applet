<div class="title">Correct</div>

<p> Yes, bulb <b>B</b> burns brighter than bulb <b>A</b>.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Solution</div>

<p><b>Plan It</b>.  The bulb that has the larger potential difference
across it burns brighter.  Bulbs <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> have the same resistance.
Given the resistance, the bulb with the greater potential difference
<font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> across it has more current <font
face="symbol"><i>I</i></font>, and dissipates more power: <i>P</i> = (<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>) <font face="symbol"><i>I</i></font>.
</p>

<p>Bulb <b>A</b> in the top circuit is in series with another bulb,
and bulb <b>B</b> in the bottom circuit is in series with a
combination of two bulbs.  Thus, in each circuit we have a voltage
divider dividing the total voltage (potential difference) across the
entire combination of light bulbs in the circuit.</p>

<p>In the top circuit, the total voltage is divided into a part across
bulb <b>A</b> and a part across the other bulb in that circuit.  In the
bottom circuit, the total voltage is divided into a part across bulb
<b>B</i> and a part across the parallel combination of the other two
light bulbs in that circuit.</p>

<p>Both circuits have the same total total voltage across their
respective combinations of bulbs. This total voltage is equal to the
battery emf, <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>, assuming the battery has no
internal resistance.  The voltage <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> is divided in
proportion to the resistances of the in-series circuit elements.  (See
Electric Circuits/Resistance/Explain It.)
