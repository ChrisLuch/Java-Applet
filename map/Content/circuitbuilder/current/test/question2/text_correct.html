<div class="title">Correct</div>

<p> Yes, Bulb <b>A</b> will burn brighter than Bulb <b>B</b>.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Solution</div>
<br>

<p><b>Plan It</b>.  The power dissipated in a bulb, which determines
the bulb's brightness, is proportional to the square of the current in
the bulb.  Thus we need to determine which circuit has the greater
current.</p>

<p><b>Set It Up and Solve It</b>.  Given the potential difference
across a resistor, the current in the resistor is inversely
proportional to the resistance.</p>  

<p>Let the resistance of one of the light bulbs be <i>R</i>.  Then the
resistance of the in-series combination of bulbs in the bottom circuit
is 2<i>R</i>.  Therefore, the current in the bottom circuit is half as
great as the current in the top circuit so that the bulbs in the
bottom circuit don't burn as bright as the bulb in the top
circuit.</p>

<p><b>Think About It</b>. Households should be wired so that lamps are
not connected in series.  Otherwise, when two lamps are turned on they
don't burn as bright as a single lamp.  Also, when one lamp is turned
off, the other one would automatically go out as well.</p>
