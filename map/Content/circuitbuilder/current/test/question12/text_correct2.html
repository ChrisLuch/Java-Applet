<div class="title">Electric Current</div>

<p>Again, because of charge conservation, the battery cannot create or
destroy charge.  The role of the battery is to keep charge moving
through the bulb and supply the energy that gets dissipated in the
bulb in the form of heat and light.  How must the battery be connected
to be able to do this?
</p>

<p>After leaving the bulb at C, the charge enters the battery at C,
from there moves inside the battery to A and then through the wire
back to B.  Thus, electric charge moves in a closed loop, from A to B
to C and back to A.  Such a closed loop is called an <i>electric
circuit</i>.  

<p>Now go on to Page 3 to see what is inside the bulb and that the
circuit is really closed inside the bulb.
