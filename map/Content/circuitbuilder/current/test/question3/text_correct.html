<p> Yes, I<sub>A</sub> < I<sub>B</sub>.</p>

<div class="subtitle">Solution</div>

<p><b>Plan It</b>.  The resistor that has the larger potential difference
across it will have the larger current.
</p>

<p>Resistors <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are in series with another
resistor or a combination of resistors, respectively.  Thus, we
have a voltage divider in each circuit, dividing the total potential
difference across the respective arrangements of resistors. In both
cases, the total potential difference is equal to the battery emf,
<i>V<sub>0</sub></i>.  The voltage <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> is divided in
proportion to the resistances in series.  (See Electric
Circuits/Resistance/Explain It.)
</p>

<p><b>Set It Up and Solve It</b>.  Let the common resistance of all
resistors be <i>R</i>.  In the top circuit, resistor A has another
resistor of the same resistance <i>R</i> in series with it.  Thus
the potential difference across each resistor is <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>/2.
</p>

<p>The resistance of the combination of two in-parallel resistors in
the bottom circuit is <b>less</b> than <i>R</i>.  In fact, it is equal
to <i>R</i>/2.  (See Resistance under Get Information.  You will find
an equation that lets you calculate this resistance.  You can also
review the theory of in-parallel resistors in Electric
Circuits/Resistance/Explain It.)
</p>

<p>The potential differences across resistors in series are
proportional to the respective resistances.  Thus, in the bottom
circuit, the potential difference across resistor B is twice that
across the in-parallel combination of resistors, or
(2/3)<i>V<sub>0</sub></i> across resistor B
vs. (1/3)<i>V<sub>0</sub></i> across the in-parallel combination.
(2/3)<i>V<sub>0</sub></i> is more than the (1/2)<i>V<sub>0</sub></i>
across resistor A.  Thus, the current in resistor B is larger than
that in resistor A.
</p>

<p><b>Think About It</b>.  Each of the two in-parallel resistors in
the bottom circuit has a potential difference of
<i>V<sub>0</sub></i>/3 across it.  This is half the
2/3<i>V<sub>0</sub></i> potential difference across resistor B.  Thus,
the current in each of the in-parallel resistors is half that in
resistor B, and together the currents in the in-parallel resistors add
up to that in resistor B.  This is as it should be according to the
Kirchhoff junction rule.
