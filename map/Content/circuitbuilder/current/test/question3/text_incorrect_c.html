<div class="title">Incorrect</div>

<p align="left">
You picked choice (c), saying that I<sub>A</sub> > I<sub>B</sub>.
</p>

<p>Hint: In the top circuit, resistor A is in a series with a single
resistor, identical to A.  In the bottom circuit, resistor B is in
series with a parallel combination of two resistors, identical to B
(and A).
</p>

<p>What is the combined resistance of these two resistors in parallel?  Is
it greater than, equal to, or less than that of a single resistor?
</p>

<p>If it is less than that of a single resistor, the total resistance
of the bottom circuit will be less than that of the top circuit,
causing the current in the bottom circuit to be greater than in the
top circuit.</p>
