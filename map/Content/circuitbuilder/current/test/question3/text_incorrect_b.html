<div class="title">Incorrect</div>

<br>
<p>
You picked choice (b), saying that I<sub>A</sub> = I<sub>B</sub>.
</p>

<p>Hint: In the top circuit, resistor A is in a series with a single
resistor, identical to A.  In the bottom circuit, resistor B is in series
with a parallel combination of two resistors, identical to B (and A).
</p>

<p>What is the combined resistance of these two in-parallel resistors?  Is it
greater than, equal to, or less than that of a single resistor?
