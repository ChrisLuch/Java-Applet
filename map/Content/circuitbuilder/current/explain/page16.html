<div class="title">Electric Current</div>

<p><b>Explanation</b>.  The resistance of the bulbs is not given.
(One could calculate it from the current values read by the meters,
but this would not be in the spirit of the original question.)
Therefore a numerical calculation of the actual currents in the
various resistors is not possible.  All that is required, however, is
a <b>comparison</b> of currents.  The following verbal explanation is
somewhat lengthy, but provides more practice with the underlying ideas
than a calculation.</p>

<p><b>Bottom Circuit</b></p>

<p>Here, with the switch in branch 2 open, we have bulbs 3 and 1 in
series so that the currents in the bulbs must be equal.  (The meters
indicate that these currents are 0.3 A.)
</p>

<p>Since the bulbs are identical, the potential difference across
each bulb must be equal as well.  Since the potential differences
across the bulbs must add up to the 6-V potential difference between
the battery terminals, there must be a potential difference of 3 V
across each bulb.
</p>

<p><b>Top Circuit</b></p>

<p>Here, bulbs 2 and 3 are in parallel and their combination is in
series with bulb 1.  Thus, by Kirchhoff's junction rule, the sum of
the currents in bulbs 2 and 3 must be equal to the current in bulb 1.
Thus, each of bulbs 2 and 3 has only half as much current as bulb 1.
(Check the ammeter readings to verify this, but note, again, that from
the information given in the question, we cannot calculate the actual
currents displayed by the meters.)

<p><b>Question</b>. How can we know that there is more current in bulb
1 in the top circuit than in the bottom circuit?
</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  In the top circuit, the current in bulb 3 is only
half that in bulb 1.  Therefore the potential difference across bulb 3
must be half that in bulb 1.  (See Note on Page 9.)  Thus, in the top
circuit, the potential difference across bulb 3 must be 2 V and that
across bulb 1 must be 4 V, adding up to the total 6-V potential
difference between the battery terminals.</p>  

<p>Since currents are proportional to potential differences, bulb 1 in
the top circuit must have more current and be a bit brighter than bulb
1 in the bottom circuit (4 V vs. 3 V potential difference) and bulb 3
in the top circuit must be a bit dimmer (2 V vs. 3 V).
