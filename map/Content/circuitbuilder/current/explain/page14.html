<div class="title">Electric Current</div>

<p>On the left are shown three identical circuits.  All bulbs are
identical.  There are three switches in each circuit, and the only
thing distinguishing the circuits is whether the switches are open or
closed.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  Can you explain the brightness of the three bulbs
and the currents in each of the three circuits?
</p>

<p><b>Top circuit</b> - all three switches are closed.  The two bulbs
in the right branch are dimmer than the single bulb in the left
branch.  Reason: The potential difference across the single bulb in
the left branch is 6 V.  The total potential difference across the two
bulbs in the right branch is also 6 V.  However, in the right branch,
the 6-V potential difference is split up into 3 V across the first
bulb and 3 V across the second bulb.  (See Page 9.)  With only 3 V
potential difference across each bulb, the bulbs in the right branch
will have less current (0.3 A) than the bulb in the left branch (0.6
A) and burn dimmer.
</p>

<p><b>Middle circuit</b> - the switch in the right branch is open.
There is no current in the right branch, because of the open switch,
so the bulbs in this branch don't burn.  The bulb in the left branch
is as bright as in the top circuit because it has the same potential
difference of 6 V across it and therefore the same current (0.6 A) as
in the top circuit.  
</p>

<p><b>Bottom circuit</b> - the switch in the left branch is open.  Now
there is no current in the left branch and the bulb in that branch
does not burn.  The bulbs in the right branch burn as in the top
circuit because they have the same total 6-V potential difference
across them as in the top circuit, split into 3-V potential
differences per bulb.  Since the potential differences across each
bulb are the same as in the top circuit, the currents in each bulb
(0.3 A) are the same as well in both circuits.
