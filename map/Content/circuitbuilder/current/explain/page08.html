<div class="title">Electric Current</div>

<p>The bulb in the top circuit burns brighter than either of the bulbs
in the bottom circuit, and the current is twice as large in the top
circuit.
</p>

<p>The triangular diagrams illustrate the situation in terms of the
fluid flow analogy.  
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>: In terms of this analogy, can you explain why the
bulb in the top circuit burns brighter?  
</p>

<p>Hint: Given two identical bulbs with different currents, the bulb
with the larger current burns brighter."
