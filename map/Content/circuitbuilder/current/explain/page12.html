<div class="title">Electric Current</div>

<p><b>Explanation of why all bulbs are equally bright</b>.  The 6-V
batteries in the two circuits raise the charge (fluid) through equal
potential differences (elevation changes).  Thus, points F,
F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>3</sub> are at the same high potential
(elevation) and points E, E<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>3</sub> are at the
same low potential (elevation).
</p>

<p>In the top circuit, a sloping pipe of length <i>a</i> (bulb)
connects points E and F while in the bottom circuit we have two
parallel pipes of the same length and slope as in the top circuit
connecting the corresponding points.  Since all pipes have the same
slope, the current in each will be the same.
</p>

<p>How do you explain that the current in meter 1 is the sum of the
currents in meters 2 and 3?
