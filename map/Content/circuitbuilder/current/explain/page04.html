<div class="title">Electric Current</div>

<br>Arrangements (a) and (b) will <b>not</b> make the bulb burn.

<p>The reason is that, in neither arrangement, the filament is part of a
closed loop.  In both arrangements, one end of the filament is
connected to one of the battery terminals, while the other end is not
connected to anything.
</p>

<p>Note that there is a closed loop in arrangement (b) and that the
path through the battery forms one segment of this loop, but that the
filament is <b>not</b> in the loop.  The closed loop in this case is
from one battery terminal through the wire to the other battery
terminal and then back inside the battery to the first terminal.  This
is, in fact, a <i>short circuit</i>, which will contain a very large
current which in all likelihood will melt the wire, but not light the
bulb.
