<div class="title">Electric Current</div>

<p><b>Explanation</b>.  Since fluid mass (electric charge) is
conserved, the fluid mass (charge) going through meters 2 and 3 into
the junction at E<sub>2</sub> every second is equal to the total mass
(charge) flowing out of the junction at E<sub>2</sub> towards meter 1.
Thus, the mass (charge) per second moving through meter 1 is equal to
the sum of the masses (charges) moving through meters 2 and 3 per
second.
</p>

<p>Generalizing this we get Kirchhoff's junction (node) rule, which is
one of the two basic rules governing DC Circuits:
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Kirchhoff's Junction (Node) Rule</div>

<p>The sum of the currents going into a junction (node) is equal to
the sum of the currents leaving the junction.
</p>

<p>The rule is a consequence of charge conservation.
