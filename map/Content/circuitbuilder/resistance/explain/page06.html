<div class="title">Resistors In Series</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The resistance of the two pipes or two light bulbs
in series is 2<i>R</i>.
</p>

<p>The reason is as follows.  First let us consider the fluid flow
situation.  When the two pipes are in series, the elevation change
along each pipe of length <i>a</i> is only half of the total elevation
change.  As we saw on Page 2, this causes the current to be only half
of what it is when a single pipe bridges the entire elevation change.
Therefore, the ratio "(potential change)/current" is twice as great
when there are two pipes in series.  (When the denominator is halved,
the ratio is doubled.)
</p>

<p>The electrical case is analogous.  The electric potential
difference is 6 V across the single bulb at the top and the two bulbs
in series at the bottom.  In the bottom circuit, by Kirchhoff's loop
rule (voltage law), the electric potential differences across the two
bulbs add.  Since they must add to 6 V and since the two bulbs are
identical and have the same current, the potential difference across
one bulb must be 3 V.  The current in a bulb is proportional to the
potential difference across it.  Thus, the current in each of the
bulbs in the bottom circuit must be half that of the current in the
bulb in the top circuit.  The two ammeter readings confirm this.
Again, the ratio "(potential change)/current" is twice as great for
the series combination of the two bulbs as for a single bulb.

<p>You may want to try to prove the following more general theorem.

<p class="definition"><b>Theorem</b>.  The combined resistance
<i>R</i> of two resistances <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> and
<i>R</i><sub>2</sub> in series is equal to 
</p>

<div class="equation"><i>R</i> = <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> +
<i>R</i><sub>2</sub>.</div>

<p>A series combination of a 12-<font face="symbol">W</font> and a
18-<font face="symbol">W</font> resistor has a resistance of 30 <font
