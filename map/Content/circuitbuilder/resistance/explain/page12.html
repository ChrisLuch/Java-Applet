<div class="title">In Series and In Parallel</div>

<p>Often more complicated circuits containing several resistors can be
simplified by grouping the resistors into in-series and in-parallel
combinations.  E.g., the circuit shown on the left can be simplified
this way.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  Given the resistances of the three resistors, can
you calculate the potential differences across the 3.6-<font
face="symbol">W</font> and 6-<font face="symbol">W</font> resistors?
</p>

<p>Hint.  Which resistors are in parallel and which ones in series?
</p>

<p>Caution: The 3.6-<font face="symbol">W</font> and 6-<font
face="symbol">W</font> resistors are <b>not</b> in series because
there is a junction between the resistors, at point F<sub>2</sub>,
causing the current in the 3.6-<font face="symbol">W</font> resistor
to be divided into two parts, one part going into the 4-<font
face="symbol">W</font> resistor and the other into the 6-<font
face="symbol">W</font> resistor.
