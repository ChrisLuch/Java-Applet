<div class="title">Resistors In Parallel</div>

<p>The two sloping pipes and the two light bulbs in the two circuits
at the bottom are said to be connected <i>in parallel</i>.  
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  If both pipes and both bulbs are identical and
each pipe or bulb has a resistance <i>R</i>, what is the resistance of
the parallel combination of pipes or bulbs?
</p>

<p>Hint.  The water obviously moves through the same change in
elevation in both pipes.  Similarly, there is the same potential
difference of 6 V across each bulb when they are connected in
parallel.  The reason is that the potentials at the top ends of the
two bulbs are equal because the wires connecting the tops have
negligible resistance so that the potential difference along these
wires is negligible as well.  (Potential difference = resistance times
current.)  For the same reason, the bottom ends of the bulbs are at
the same potential.
