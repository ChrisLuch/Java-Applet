<div class="title">Resistors In Parallel</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The resistance of the parallel combination of pipes
or bulbs is <i>R</i>/2 if the resistance of each pipe or bulb alone is
<i>R</i>.
</p>

<p>The reason is this.  Let us look at the fluid flow situation
first.  Since both pipes are identical and have the same elevation
change, there will be the same current in both pipes.  Thus, the total
current in both pipes together will be 2I if the current in one pipe
is I.  Thus, the ratio (gravitational potential difference)/(total
current) calculated for the parallel combination of pipes is half that
for an individual pipe because the denominator is equal to 2I rather
than just I.
</p>

<p>The electrical case is analogous.  By Kirchhoff's junction rule
(current law), the total current in the circuit is equal to the sum of
the currents in the two bulbs.  Thus, if the current in one bulb is
0.6 A, the total current for two bulbs is 1.2 A.  (Compare the
ammeters in the top and bottom circuits.)  Twice the current in the
denominator implies half the resistance, given a constant potential
difference (equal to 6 V in the present case).
