<div class="title">Voltage Dividers</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The individual potential differences across two
resistors in series must be in the same proportion as the resistances
of the two resistors.  This is so because both resistors have the same
current so that the equation <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> =
<i>R<font face="symbol">I</font></i><spacer type="horizontal"
size="5">, applied to each resistor in turn, implies that <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> is proportional to <i>R</i>.  Thus, if
<i>V</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>2</sub> denote the potential
differences across the top and bottom resistors, we must have
</p>

<div class="equation"><i>V</i><sub>1</sub>/<i>V</i><sub>2</sub> = 4/8 = 1/2
.</div>

We also have

<div class="equation"><i>V</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>V</i><sub>2</sub> = 12 .</div>

<p>These are two equations for the two unknowns <i>V</i><sub>1</sub> and
<i>V</i><sub>2</sub>.  They have the solutions
</p>

<div class="equation"><i>V</i><sub>1</sub> = 4 V and <i>V</i><sub>2</sub> = 8 V ,</div>

<p>which you can verify by substituting these values into the two
equations above.
</p>

<p>A colloquial expression for electric potential difference is
<i>voltage</i>, and a series combination of resistances is called a
<i>voltage divider</i> because it divides the total voltage (12 V in
the present case) into two parts, in proportion to the resistances
combined in series.  By choosing appropriate resistances, one can
produce any voltage (potential difference) that is a fraction of the
given total voltage.
