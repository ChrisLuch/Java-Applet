<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p>The ammeter shows that the current in the meter is equal to 1.2
A.&nbsp; This is also the current in the resistor. Multiplying the
current by the resistor's resistance of 10 <font
face="symbol">W</font> gives
</p>

<div class="equation">R I&nbsp; =&nbsp; 10 x 1.2&nbsp; =&nbsp; 12 V.</div>

<p>In general, the product RI is equal to the magnitude |<font
face="Symbol">D</font>V| of the potential change across the resistor,
</p>

<div class="equation">|<font face="Symbol">D</font>V|= R I,</div>

<p>where R is the resistance of the resistor and I is the current in
the resistor. This equation is an immediate consequence of the
definition of resistance. See Resistance under Get Information.
