<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>: The switch is now closed, there is a current in the
circuit, and the light bulb is glowing. The potential difference
across the closed switch is zero because the resistance of a closed
switch is zero.
</p>

<p>Now change the emf of the battery to 100 V (select the battery with
the Select Tool, reset the emf in the display area, and click the
calculator icon to recalculate the circuit). If you have done this
correctly, the bulb will burn out.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>: If the light bulb is burnt out and the circuit is
otherwise the same as before, what is the potential difference across
the <b>bulb</b>?
</p>

<p>First try to think of an answer, then check your answer with a
voltmeter. The next page will have an explanation.
