<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p><b>Question</b>: Now, add a light bulb in the left part of the
circuit and try to predict what the potential difference will be
across the open switch. Then check your prediction by reading the
voltmeter.
</p>

<p><b>Explanation</b>: When the switch is open, the potential
difference across the switch is 12 V as earlier. Adding a light bulb
to the circuit in addition to the resistor does not change the current
in the circuit. It remains 0 as before, and the potential difference
across the open switch remains equal to 12 V, for the same reasons as
before.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>: Now close the switch and predict what will happen
to the potential difference across the switch. The result will be
discussed on the next page.
