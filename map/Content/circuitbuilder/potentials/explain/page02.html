<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The gravitational potential energy of a fluid
particle of mass <i>m</i> at an elevation <i>y</i> is equal to
<i>mgy</i>.  Therefore, the gravitational potential at elevation
<i>y</i> is equal to
</p>

<div class="equation"><i>mgy</i>/<i>m</i> = <i>gy</i> .</div>

<p>Thus, except for the constant factor of <i>g</i>, the gravitational
potential at a point is equal to the elevation <i>y</i> of that point.
</p>

<p>At the given elevations, the gravitational potential has the values
listed in the following table (where <i>g</i> = 10
m/s<sup>2</sup>):</p>

<p><center>

<table BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="10">

<tr>

<td><i>y</i> [m]</td><td>grav. pot. [J/kg]</td>

</tr>

<tr><td  align="center">10</td><td align="center">100</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">30</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">20</td></tr>

</table>

<p>The gravitational potential has a definite value at any given point
along the pipes.</p>  

<p><b>Distinguish</b> between the <i>potential at a
point</i> and the <i>potential difference between two points</i>.
E.g., the potential <b>difference</b> between the points at the bottom
and top of the narrow pipe, in the direction of the fluid flow, is</p> 

<div class="equation"><font face="symbol">D</font><i>PE</i> = 30 -
100 = - 70 J/kg.</div>


<p>Note that the fluid current in the pipes is from high to low
gravitational potential.  
</p>

<div class="definition"><p class="subtitle">Definition of electric potential</p>

<p><i>Electric potential</i> is defined in analogy to gravitational
potential as the electric potential energy of a charged particle of
charge q divided by the charge q.  The SI-unit of the electric
potential is the volt (V).
</p>
</div>

<p>Since electric current consists of moving charges, the role of
electric potential in electric circuits is therefore analogous to that
of gravitational potential (essentially elevation) in fluid circuits.
</p>

<p>On the following pages, the properties of the electric potential in
an electric circuit will be explored.
