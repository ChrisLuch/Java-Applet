<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>: As you can see, the magnitude of the potential
difference across the open switch is 12 V.&nbsp; It is <b>not</b> 0 as
one might be tempted to think, because the current in the switch is
zero.
</p>

<p>Similarly, if you have an open switch at home in your 110-V
household wiring, there will be 110 V across that switch.&nbsp; It is
not a good idea to work on that switch while the wires are exposed
because you can easily get an electric shock if you simultaneously
touch the wires leading to different poles.
</p>


<p>The magnitude of the potential difference across the switch in the
present situation must be equal to the battery emf, which is 12 V.  
</p>

<p>Reason: By Kirchhoff's Loop Rule, the sum of all potential changes
around the circuit is zero.  In going clockwise around the circuit,
there is a 12 V potential difference across the battery.  Since there
is no current in the circuit when the switch is open, the potential
difference across the resistor, which is equal to the product RI, must
be zero and likewise the potential difference along the wires.  Thus
there must be a -12 V potential change across the switch to make the
sum of all potential changes equal to zero.
</p>

<p>Note that the potential change across the switch can have a
magnitude of 12 V even though the current is zero because the
resistance of an open switch is infinite.  For an open switch the
product RI, infinity times zero, is undetermined, which is consistent
with a value of 12 V.
