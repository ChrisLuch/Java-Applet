<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p>The voltmeter connected across the bulb reads 22.4 V, and the
voltmeter across the open switch 77.6 V.  The sum of the two potential
differences must be equal to the terminal potential difference of the
battery, i.e., 100 V.
</p>

<p>In the situation here, the voltmeter readings are determined by the
internal resistances of the two meters.  The circuit we are dealing
with is quite unusual because only the path <b>through</b> the two
meters completes the circuit.  If one or both meters were removed,
there would not be a closed circuit because both the burnt out bulb
and the open switch break the circuit.
</p>

<p>Since the two meters are in series, they therefore split the total
100 V into two parts according to the ratio of the meters' internal
resistances.  You can check what these internal resistances are by
clicking on the meters with the Select Tool.  You can also change
these resistances and observe how the voltmeter readings change.
(Don't forget to click on the calculator icon after changing a
resistance value.  This recalculates the circuit.)
</p>

<p>Voltmeters have very large internal resistances.  This way, if
connected in parallel with something like a light bulb that has a much
smaller resistance, the meter will draw only an insignificant amount
of current and not change the potential difference across the bulb.
However, if the bulb is burnt out, the very large resistance of the
voltmeter is still smaller than the now almost infinite resistance of
the bulb.  In this case, the potential difference across the meter
depends very much on the resistance of the meter.
