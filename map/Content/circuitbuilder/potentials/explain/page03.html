<div class="title">Electric Potentials and Potential Differences</div>

<p>In the following it is assumed that you have worked through
Electric Circuits/Basic Facts/Simulate It/Demo and are familiar with
the DC Circuit simulation.
</p>

<p>Select the Select Tool (<img SRC="../../images/arrowButton.jpg"
height=26 width=37 align=ABSCENTER>) and then click at a grid point in
the circuit.&nbsp; The electric potential at that point will be
displayed.
</p>

<p>Verify that the potential is 12 V anywhere between the positive
pole of the battery and the resistor and that it is 0 V anywhere
between the negative pole of the battery and the resistor.
</p>

<p>You may wonder how the potential can be 0 at the negative pole of
the battery, why it isn't negative there. When referring to a battery
pole as 'negative', all one means is that this pole is <b>more</b>
negative (than the other pole).
</p>

<p>One can always add a constant to the potential at a given point, as
long as one adds the same constant at all other points.  E.g., if one
adds -17 V at all points, the potential would be -17 V at the
'negative' pole of the battery, and it would be -5 V at the 'positive'
pole.  This would not change the <b>difference</b> between the
potentials at any given two points.
