<div class="title">Correct</div>

<p>Yes, the potential difference across the 6-<font
face="symbol">W</font> resistor is equal to 4 V.</p>


<p><b>Plan It</b>. The problem involves two unknown potential
differences across the two resistors.  We need two equations to find
these two unknowns (or even only one of them).</p>

<p>Potential differences along a given path add, and, according to
Kirchhoff's loop rule (voltage law), the sum of potential differences
around a closed loop is zero.  This provides one equation for the
potential differences across the two resistors.</p>

<p>Another equation for the two potential differences can be obtained
from the fact that the current in two resistors in series is the same,
by charge conservation.  This current can be related to the potential
differences across the two resistors, using the definition of
resistance.  This yields a second relation between the two potential
differences.</p>

<p><b>Set It Up</b>.  From Kirchhoff's loop rule, moving around the
circuit in clockwise fashion, we get</p>

<div class="equation">12 V - <i>V<sub>12</sub></i> -
<i>V<sub>6</sub></i> = 0</div>

or

<div class="equation"><i>V<sub>12</sub></i> + <i>V<sub>6</sub></i> =
12 V <spacer type="horizontal" size="30">(1)</div>
  
<p>where <i>V<sub>12</sub></i> and <i>V<sub>6</sub></i> are the
<b>magnitudes</b> of the potential differences across the 12-<font
face="symbol">W</font> and 6-<font face="symbol">W</font> resistors,
respectively.</p>

<p>By the definition of resistance, the common current <i><font
face="symbol">I</font></i> <spacer type="horizontal" size="5"> in the
two resistors can be expressed in terms of the potential differences
across and the resistances of these resistors as follows:</p>

<div class="equation"><i><font face="symbol">I</font></i> <spacer
type="horizontal" size="5"> =
<i>V<sub>12</sub></i>/<i>R<sub>12</sub></i> =
<i>V<sub>6</sub></i>/<i>R<sub>6</sub></i>. <spacer type="horizontal"
size="30">(2)</div>

<p>Thus, the two potential differences are in proportion to the two
resistances.</p>

<p><b>Solve It</b>. Substituting numbers into Equation (2) gives</p>

<div class="equation"><i>V<sub>12</sub></i>/<i>V<sub>6</sub></i> =
12/6 = 2. <spacer type="horizontal" size="30">(3)</div>

<p>It is now easy to solve for the two unknowns, <i>V<sub>12</sub></i> and
<i>V<sub>6</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Equation (3) gives <i>V<sub>12</sub></i> =
2<i>V<sub>6</sub></i>.  When this is substituted into Equation (1),
<i>V<sub>12</sub></i> is eliminated and we get the following equation
for <i>V<sub>6</sub></i>:</p>

<div class="equation">2<i>V<sub>6</sub></i> + <i>V<sub>6</sub></i> =
3<i>V<sub>6</sub></i> = 12 V </div>

whence

<div class="equation"><i>V<sub>6</sub></i> = 4 V. <spacer
type="horizontal" size="30">(4)</div>

<p><b>Think About It</b>.  We can check this result as follows.  With
result (4), Equation (1) gives <i>V<sub>12</sub></i> = 8 V. This is
consistent with Equation (3) because the ratio of the two potential
differences, 8/4, is indeed equal to 2.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b>. An arrangement of two or more resistors in series
is called a <i>potential divider</i> because the total potential
difference across the entire arrangement is divided into parts that
add up to the total.  The parts are in proportion to the individual
resistances.  See Equations (1) and (3).</p>
