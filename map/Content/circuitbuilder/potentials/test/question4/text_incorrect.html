<div class="title">Incorrect</div>

<p>You have picked an incorrect choice.
</p>

<p><u>Hints</u></p>  

<p>The single resistor on the left is <b>in series</b> with the
in-parallel combination of the two resistors on the right.  The 12-V
potential difference across the entire arrangement of three resistors
is the sum of the potential differences across the single resistor and
the in-parallel combination.  How is the 12-V potential difference
split up among these two in-series resistance elements?</p>

<p>Remember that the three resistors have the resistance, which you
may want to call <i>R</i>. You will need to work out the combined
resistance of the two in-parallel resistors in terms of <i>R</i>. (For
the equation necessary to work out the answer, see Resistance under
Get Information.)</p>
