<div class="title">Incorrect</div>

<p>One <b>can</b> work out the potential difference across the single
resistor on the left, even if one does not know the value of the
resistance <i>R</i> of each of the three identical resistors.</p>

<p><u>Hint</u>. The single resistor on the left is in series with the
in-parallel combination of two resistors on the right.  How is the
total 12-V potential difference divided among these two in-series
resistance elements?</p>

<p>To answer the preceding question, you need to work out the combined
resistance of the in-parallel combination of resistors in terms of
<i>R</i>.  (For the necessary equation see Resistance under Get
Information.)</p>
