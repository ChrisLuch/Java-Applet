<div class="title">Correct</div>

<p> Yes, the potential difference across the single resistor
on the left is 8 V.
</p>

<div class="title">Solution</div>

<br>

<p><b>Plan It</b></p>

<p>The single resistor on the left is in series with a combination of
two resistors in parallel on the right.  The potential difference
across the in-series arrangement is divided up among the in-series
elements in proportion to their resistances.</p>

<p><b>Set It Up and Solve It</b></p>

<p>Let each of the three resistors have the resistance <i>R</i>.  The
combined resistance <i>R<sub>||</sub></i> of the two in-parallel
resistors can be determined from the equation</p>

<div class="equation">1/<i>R<sub>||</sub></i> = 1/<i>R</i> +
1/<i>R</i> = 2/<i>R</i> </div>

<br>whence

<div class="equation"> <i>R<sub>||</sub></i> = <i>R</i>/2 .</div>

<p>Thus, the single resistor on the left with a resistance equal to
<i>R</i> is in series with a resistance equal to <i>R</i>/2.  This
implies that the potential difference across the single resistor is
twice as large as the potential difference across the in-parallel
combination. These two potential differences must add up to 12 V.
Thus, it is easy to guess the answer that the potential difference is
8 V across the single resistor and 4 V across the in-parallel
combination.</p>

<p>One can also work out this result algebraically.  Let us denote the
potential differences across the single resistor and the in-parallel
combination by <i>V<sub>single</sub></i> and <i>V<sub>||</sub></i>,
respectively.  Then the following two equations for these two unknowns
are true:</p>

<p><div class="equation"><i>V<sub>single</sub></i> + <i>V<sub>||</sub></i>
= 12</div>

<br>

<div class="equation"> <i>V<sub>single</sub></i>/<i>V<sub>||</sub></i>
= <i>R<sub>single</sub></i>/<i>R<sub>||</sub></i> = 2. </div>

<p>It is easy to solve these equations for <i>V<sub>single</sub></i>.  The
second equation gives</p>

<div class="equation"><i>V<sub>||</sub></i> = 0.5<i>V<sub>single</sub></i>.  </div>

<p>Substituting this into the first equation gives</p>

<div class="equation"><i>V<sub>single</sub></i> + 0.5 <i>V<sub>single</sub></i>
= 1.5 <i>V<sub>single</sub></i> = 2 </div>

<br>

whence

<div class="equation"><i>V<sub>single</sub></i> = 12/1.5 = 8 V. </div>

<p>

<p><b>Think About It</b></p>

<p>The current in the single resistor must be equal to the total
current in the in-parallel combination, by charge conservation (or
Kirchhoff's current law).  Each resistor in the in-parallel
combination has a voltage of 4 V across it.  Therefore, by the
definition of resistance, the current in each of these resistors is
only half that of the current in the single resistor.  This is
consistent with the fact that the sum of the currents in the
in-parallel resistors must add up to the current in the single
resistor.</p>
