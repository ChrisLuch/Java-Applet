<div class="title">Electric Potential</div>

<div class="definition"><p class="subtitle">Definition</p>

<p>Every static electric field has an electric potential associated
with it.  Like the electric field, the <i>electric potential</i> is a
'field variable'.  This means that the electric potential has a
certain value at every point in space and that this value may be
different from one point to the next.  The electric potential may be
constant throughout some region in space.</p>  

<p>There is an electric field inside the wires of an electric circuit
and inside the other circuit elements.  Thus, at every point inside
the wires and the other elements of an electric circuit the electric
potential has a well-defined value, different values in general at
different points in the circuit.</p>
</div>

<p><u>Definition</u>. The <i>electric potential V</i> at a point in
space in general, and at a point in an electric circuit in particular,
is defined as the ratio
</p>

<div class="equation"><i>V</i> = <i>PE</i>/<i>q</i></div>

<p>where <i>PE</i> is the electric potential energy of a test charge
<i>q</i> at the given point.  The value of the electric potential at a
given point does not depend on the value of the test charge at that
point because the potential energy is proportional to the test charge
so that the value of the test charge cancels.</p>  

<p>From the definition above, it is clear that the electric potential
at a point is a scalar quantity, because potential energy is a scalar
quantity.  This is one reason why it is often easier to work with the
electric potential than with the electric field.  The latter is a
vector quantity, which is harder to work with than a scalar
quantity.</p>

<p>By dividing the potential energy of a test charge by the test
charge, one obtains a quantity that is independent of the test charge
and that characterizes the electric conditions that are present at
that point in space.  (This corresponds to the way the electric field
is defined at a point: as the ratio of the electric force acting on a
test charge at that point divided by the test change.)
</p>

<p>The SI-unit of electric potential is the <i>volt</i>, symbol: V.
A volt is equal to (1 J)/(1 C).
</p>

<p><u>Example</u>.  The electric potential at a point where a test
charge of 2.0x10<sup>-6</sup> C has a potential energy of
8.0x10<sup>-4</sup> J is equal to
</p>

<div class="equation"><i>V</i> = (8.0x10<sup>-4</sup>)/(2.0x10<sup>-6</sup>) = 400
V .</div>

<br>
<div class="subtitle">Potential Difference</div>

<p>The <i>potential difference</i> between two points A and B is
simply the difference of the values of the potential at these two
points.  Thus if the potential at A is 60 V and the potential at B is
40 V, then the potential difference going from A to B is
</p>

<div class="equation"><i>V<sub>B</sub></i> - <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> = 40
- 60 = - 20 V. </div>

<p>The potential difference is +20 V if instead of <i>V<sub>B</sub></i>
- <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> one is interested in <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> -
<i>V<sub>B</sub></i>.
</p>

<p>Often one wants to know the potential difference between two points
in a circuit that are at the opposite ends of a resistor.  One then
speaks of the 'potential difference across the resistor'.
</p>

<p>A colloquial term for potential difference is <i>voltage</i>.  Make
sure you distinguish between voltage, which is the <b>difference</b>
between the potentials at two points, and the potential at a point.
There is no such thing as a 'voltage at a point'.
</p>

<p>When referring to the 'voltage' between two points one is usually
only interested in the <b>magnitude</b> of the potential difference
between the two points.</p>

<div class="subtitle">Addition of Potential Differences</div>

<p>Suppose you go from a point A to a point B and then on to a third
point C.  These may be three points in space or three points in an
electric circuit.  At each point, the electric potential has a
definite value.  Let the values at the three points be denoted
<i>V<sub>A</sub></i>, <i>V<sub>B</sub></i>, and <i>V<sub>C</sub></i>,
respectively.  Then it is obvious algebraically that</p>

<div class="equation">(<i>V<sub>B</sub></i> - <i>V<sub>A</sub></i>) +
(<i>V<sub>C</sub></i> - <i>V<sub>B</sub></i>) = <i>V<sub>C</sub></i>
- <i>V<sub>A</sub></i> .</div>

<p>In words, the potential difference between A and B plus the
potential difference between B and C is equal to the total potential
difference between A and C.  <b>Potential differences taken over the
segments of a path from A to C add</b>.  Thus, if two resistors in a
circuit are connected in series, then the total potential difference
across both resistors is the sum of the potential differences across
the two resistors separately.</p>

<div class="subtitle">Kirchhoff's Loop Rule (Voltage Law)</div>

<p>The sum of the potential differences between a string of points
that form a closed loop is equal to zero.  (Necessarily, some
potential differences will be positive, some will be negative.)
</p>

<p>This is a consequence of the fact that the electric potential
energy of a test charge has a definite value at a given point in
space.  Therefore, if one moves a test charge around a closed loop,
its potential energy will in general vary along the loop, but return
to the value at the starting point when the charge is returned to that
point.  Thus, there is no overall change in potential energy of the
charge as the charge is moved around the loop.  The same must then be
true for the electric potential, because it differs from the electric
potential energy only by a constant factor.
</p>

<p>A corollary of Kirchhoff's loop rule is the statement that the sums
of potential differences taken along two different paths from a point
A to a point B are equal.
</p>
 
<p>Kirchhoff's voltage law is a consequence of energy conservation.
If the potential energy of a charge did not return to the original
value when the charge returns to the starting point, one could
gain energy by moving a charge around a circuit.
