<div class=title>DC Circuit Laboratory Simulation</div>

<br><b>Preparation</b>: DC Circuits/Basic Facts/Simulate It/Demo.

<p>The Demo listed above describes all the features of the DC Circuit
Lab simulation on Page 2 where you will be able to experiment freely
with the simulation.
</p>

You can

<ul>

<li>build your own circuit consisting of batteries, resistors,
light bulbs, and switches, and you can connect ammeters and
voltmeters,</li>

<li>set parameters like battery emf's, internal resistances of
batteries and meters, resistances of resistors, voltage and power
ratings of light bulbs, etc.,</li>

<li>make the program display the current and potential at any point
in the circuit and display the potential difference across any circuit
element.</li>

</ul>

<p>Thus, you can develop and check your understanding of DC Circuits
by building a circuit, predicting what the currents and potentials at
different points of the circuit will be, and then comparing your
predictions with the answers provided by the program.
</p>

Have fun.
