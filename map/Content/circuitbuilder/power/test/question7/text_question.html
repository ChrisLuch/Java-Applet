<div class="title">Question 7</div>

<p>A 100V battery is connected to an unspecified number of resistors
as shown. (Right now, three resistors are shown, but you should
imagine that more resistors can be connected in similar fashion. Each
resistor dissipates a power of 400W when the potential difference
across the resistor is 100 V. The circuit also contains a thin wire
segment (fuse) between points A and B that melts when the current in
the segment reaches 15 A. The other wires in the circuit can tolerate
much larger currents.
</p>

<p>What is the maximum number of resistors that can
be inserted into the circuit in the fashion shown without melting the
wire segment between points <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>?
