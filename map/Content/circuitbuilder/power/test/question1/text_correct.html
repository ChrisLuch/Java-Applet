<p>Yes, the resistor dissipates 24 W of power.</p>

<p><b>Plan It</b>.  We know the potential difference <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> across the resistor and the resistance
<i>R</i> of the resistor.  There is a standard equation that expresses
the power <i>P</i> dissipated in a resistor in terms of these two
quantities.</p>

<p><b>Set It Up and Solve It</b>.  The equation for the power
dissipated in a resistor gives</p>

<div class="equation"><i>P</i> = (<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>)<sup>2</sup>/<i>R</i> =
12<sup>2</sup>/6 = 24 W.</div>

<p><b>Think About It</b>.  This means that every second 24 J of
electric energy are converted into thermal energy in the resistor.
This energy is supplied by the battery where chemical energy is
continually being converted to electrical energy while there is a
current in the battery.</p>
