<div class="title">Power in Electric Circuits</div>

<p><b>Answer</b>.  Twice as much power is dissipated in the bottom
circuit as in the top circuit.</p>

<p>The key to the answer is that, when resistors are connected to a
battery in-parallel, the potential difference across each resistor is
equal to the battery voltage, 12 V in the present case.  The battery
voltage is not 'split' in some way between the two resistors.  This is
a consequence of Kirchhoff's Loop Rule (Voltage Law).</p>

<p>Let <i>V<sub>0</sub></i> denote the battery voltage.  Then the
power dissipated in each resistor in the bottom circuit is</p>

<p align="center"><i>P</i> =
<i>V<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>/<i>R</i>,

<p>which is also the power dissipated in the one resistor in the top
circuit.</p>

<p>Since there are two resistors in the bottom circuit, each
dissipating as much power as the resistor in the top circuit, there is
twice as much power dissipated in the bottom circuit.</p>

<p>This example illustrates why household wiring is arranged so that
electrical appliances in a household are always in-parallel.  This
way, they all have the same 110-V potential difference across them and
dissipate the power they are designed to dissipate.  If they were
connected in series, the power dissipated by an appliance would depend
on what other appliances are connected in-series with it and would be
less than what it is designed to dissipate unless it were the only
appliance in use in the household.
