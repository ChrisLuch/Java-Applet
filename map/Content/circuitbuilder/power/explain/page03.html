<div class="title">Power in Electric Circuits</div>

<p>The following question illustrates that intuition can be misleading
when dealing with power.

<p><b>Question</b>.  All resistors in the two circuits shown are
identical.  The batteries in the two circuits are identical as well.
Which circuit dissipates more power, the top circuit or the bottom
circuit?</p>

<p>It is tempting to say that there is twice as much power dissipated
in the bottom circuit because it has two resistors rather than one.
However, rather than jumping to this conclusion, let us work out what
the power is in the two circuits by using equations.

<p>Try to work out the ratio of the powers dissipated in the two
circuits.  Then go on to Page 4 to compare.</p>
