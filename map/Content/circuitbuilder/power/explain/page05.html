<div class="title">Power in Electric Circuits</div>

<p>There is another way of seeing that the top circuit dissipates
twice as much power.</p>

<p>The in-series resistors in the bottom circuit are a voltage
divider, dividing the total potential difference <i>V<sub>0</sub></i>,
which is equal to 12 V here, into two equal halves.  Thus, in the
present case, the potential difference across each one of the
resistors in the bottom circuit is 12/2 = 6 V, or
<i>V<sub>0</sub></i>/2 in general.</p>

<p>Thus, the power dissipated in each of the resistors in the bottom
circuit is</p>

<p align="center"><i>P</i> =
(<i>V<sub>0</sub></i>/2)<i><sup>2</sup></i>/<i>R</i> = (1/4)
<i>V<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></i>/<i>R</i> = (1/4)
<i>P<sub>top</sub></i>.

<p>The total power dissipated in the bottom circuit is twice this
amount because there are two resistors, but even that is only half the
power dissipated in the top circuit.</p>
