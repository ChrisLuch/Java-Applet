<p><b>Question</b>.  All resistors in both circuits are identical and
so are the batteries.  The internal resistances of the batteries are
negligible.  Where is more power dissipated, in the top or in the
bottom circuit?</p>

<p>Work out the ratio of the powers dissipated in the two circuits.</p>

<p>Hint: Work out the total resistance of the bottom circuit as a
multiple of R.</p>

<p>When done, go on to Page 9 to compare.</p>
