<p>Let us now replace the in-series combination of resistors by an
in-parallel combination, as shown on the left.

<p><b>Question</b>.  All resistors in the two circuits shown are
identical.  The batteries in the two circuits are identical as well.
Which circuit dissipates more power, and by what factor?</p>

<p>Try to work out the answer.  Then go on to Page 7 to compare.</p>
