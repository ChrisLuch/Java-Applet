<p><b>Answer</b>.  The power <i>P</i> dissipated in a resistor that
has a potential <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> across the
resistor and a current <i><font face="symbol">I</font></i> in the
resistor is given by</p>

<p align="center"><i>P</i> = (<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>)<i><font face="symbol">I</font></i>.

<p>For <font face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i> = 12 V and <i><font
face="symbol">I</font></i> = 2 A, this gives</p>

<p align="center"><i>P</i> =  12x2 = 24 W .

<p>For a derivation of the equation used above, click <a
href="page02_VI_derivation.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>We could have used another equation, namely,</p>

<p align="center"><i>P</i> = (<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>)<sup>2</sup>/<i>R<sub>1</sub></i> .

<p>The value of <i>R<sub>1</sub></i> is easily found from the
definition of resistance to be</p>

<p align="center"><i>R<sub>1</sub></i> = <font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>/<i><font face="symbol">I</font></i> =
12/2 = 1.2 <font face="symbol">W</font>.</p>

<p>Thus, the power dissipated in resistor <i>R<sub>1</sub></i> is

<p align="center"><i>P</i> = (<font
face="symbol">D</font><i>V</i>)<sup>2</sup>/<i>R<sub>1</sub></i> =
12<sup>2</sup>/1.2 = 24 W.

<p><b>Question</b>.  At what rate is chemical energy converted into
electrical energy in the battery and then dissipated in the entire
circuit?

<p><b>Answer</b>.  The power of energy conversion in the battery is
equal to the battery emf, 100 V in this case, times the current in the
battery, 2 A.  This amounts to 100x2 = 200 W.  By energy conservation,
this must equal the power dissipated in the entire circuit.</p>

<p>Where in the circuit is this power dissipated?  Wherever there is
non-zero resistance in the circuit.  Neglecting the resistance in the
wires, there is resistance in the two resistors <b>and</b> inside the
battery.  If the battery is freshly charged, its internal resistance
is usually negligible.  In that case, the 200 W are dissipated
entirely in the two resistors.

<p>One can obtain this result also as follows.  If the internal
battery resistance is zero, the potential difference across the
battery terminals is equal to the battery emf of 100 V.  The potential
difference between the battery terminals is the potential difference
across the two resistors considered as one unit.  There is a
current of 2 A in this unit.  Thus the power dissipated in both
resistors together is 100x2 = 200 W.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  What power is dissipated in resistor
<i>R<sub>2</sub></i>?

<p>Since 24 W are dissipated in resistor <i>R<sub>1</sub></i>, 200 -
24 = 176 W must be dissipated in resistor <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>,
because power like energy is an additive quantity.  (The power
dissipated in resistor <i>R<sub>1</sub></i> added to the power
dissipated in resistor <i>R<sub>2</sub></i> is equal to the power
dissipated in both resistors together.)

<p>You can verify this result by multiplying the potential difference
across resistor <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>, which is 100 - 12 = 88 V, by the
current in the resistor, 2 A.</p>
