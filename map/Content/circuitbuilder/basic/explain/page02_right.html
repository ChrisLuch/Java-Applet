<div class="title">Electric Circuits</div>

<p><b>Circuits</b>.  A basic circuit, whether an electric, fluid or
other circuit, is a loop in which some substance can circulate.  In
the fluid circuit on the left, fluid circulates up through the pump,
down the inclined narrow pipe, and back to the pump through the wide
horizontal pipe.


<p>In the analogous electric circuit shown below, the circulating
'fluid' consists of electrically charged particles.  The pump is a
battery, and the pipes are <i>conducting</i> metal wires, the narrow
pipe being the high-resistance wire of a heating coil (as in a toaster).


<p>Conductors are materials containing movable charged
particles. E.g., in metals, the most common type of conductor,
negatively charged electrons are released by the fixed atoms and are
free to <b>move</b> throughout the metal.  A metal atom becomes a
positively charged ion after giving up an electron.  Overall, the
metal is neutral.
