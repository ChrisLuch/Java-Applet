<p>Arrangements (a) and (b) will <b>not</b> make the bulb burn.
</p>

<p>The reason is that in neither arrangement is the filament a segment
in a closed loop.  In both arrangements, one end of the filament is
connected to one of the battery terminals, while the other end is not
connected to anything.
</p>

<p>Note that there is a closed loop in arrangement (b).  The path
through the battery forms one segment of this loop, but the filament
is <b>not</b> a segment in the loop.  The closed loop in this case is
from the left battery terminal through the wire to the right terminal
and then back inside the battery.  This is, in fact, a <i>short
circuit</i>, which will contain a very large current that in all
likelihood will melt the wire and get the battery hot, but not light
the bulb.
