<div class="title">Electric Circuits</div>

<p><b>Conventional Current</b>.  Electric currents are not always made
of moving <b>negative</b> charges, as in metals.  For example, inside
a battery, the current consists of positively and negatively charged
ions moving in a liquid in opposite directions.  By the way, this is
one instance where the fluid analogy of electric current <b>fails</b>
because the mass of fluid particles can only be positive while
electric charge can be both positive and negative.
</p>

<p>If positive and negative charges are moving in an electric circuit,
they will always move in opposite directions.  Does this mean the
electric current has two different directions at once?
</p>

<p><b>No!</b> Positive charges moving left have in all respects the
same physical effects as negative charges moving right.  Using
financial transactions as an analogy, giving somebody 100 dollars
(positive money) is equivalent to removing a $100 debt (negative
money) from that person.  The person will have gained equally in both
cases.
</p>

<p>Therefore one can <b>define</b> a single direction of electric
current, the <i>conventional current direction</i>. This is the
direction in which equivalent positive charges would move.  If a
current consists entirely of moving negative charges, the
<b>conventional</b> current direction is <b>opposite</b> to the motion
of the charges, because positive charges constituting an equivalent
current would move oppositely to the negative charges.
</p>

<p>It is easiest in most cases to simply forget about whether the
charges constituting the current are positive or negative or are a
mixture of the two, and to pretend they are all positive.
