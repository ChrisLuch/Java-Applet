<div class="title">Electric Circuits</div>

<p><b>Currents</b>.  The <i>current</i> at some point A in the fluid
flow circuit is defined as the rate at which fluid mass passes this
point, i.e., as the ratio
</p>

<p><center>(fluid mass past A in time interval
<font face="symbol">D</font>t)/<font face="symbol">D</font>t.</center>

<p>The electric current at some point A in the electric circuit is
defined analogously, with 'electric charge' replacing 'fluid mass'.
The SI-unit of electric current is the <i>ampere</i>, or <i>amp</i>
for short.  Symbol: A.  With the coulomb (C) as the SI-unit of
electric charge,</p>

<div class="equation">1 ampere = (1 coulomb)/(1 second).</div>


<p><b>Mass and charge conservation</b>. The current has the same value
everywhere in these circuits.  E.g., in the fluid circuit, the current
is the same at the bottom of the incline as at the top.  The reason is
that mass is conserved. For example, if 0.5 kg of fluid is entering at
the top of the sloping pipe every second, then 0.5 kg must be leaving
the pipe at the bottom every second, and 0.5 kg must be passing point
A every second. Similarly, in the electric circuit, the electric
current is the same everywhere because of electric charge
conservation.
