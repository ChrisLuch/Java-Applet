<p><b>DC vs. AC Circuits</b></p>

<p>

<p>One distinguishes between DC (Directed Current) circuits and AC
(Alternating Current) circuits.  The principles of DC circuits also
apply to AC circuits as long as there are no inductive and capacitive
elements in the circuit.  When dealing with an AC circuit, one can
pretend one has a DC circuit with currents, potential differences, and
powers equal to the rms currents, potential differences, and powers of
the AC circuit.  For more details, see below under AC Circuits.</p>

<p><b>DC Circuits and Fluid Flow Analogy</b></p>

<p>Many aspects of DC circuits can be explained by making an analogy
with fluid flow.  Compare the following two diagrams, the one on
the left showing a fluid flow circuit and the one on the right an
electric DC circuit.</p>

<p>The two circuits have the following features in common.

<p>

<ul>

<li>They are both <i>circuits</i>, i.e., closed paths.  This makes it
possible for the 'stuff' that is moving inside these circuits to
continually be moving around the circuit.</li>

<p>

<li>The stuff that is moving in the fluid circuit is a fluid, e.g.,
water, while in the DC circuit it is electrically charged particles.

<p>The amount of stuff in the two circuits is <b>conserved</b>.  This
means that the amount of water moving in the pipes or the amount of
electric charge moving in the wires of the circuit is constant.  No
water or electric charge is either lost from or added to the
circuit.</li>

<p>

<li>Both the fluid and the charged particles are moving in one
direction.  This direction is determined by the direction in which the
pump is moving the fluid or the battery is moving the charged
particles.</li>

<p>

<li>Both the pump and the battery do work in moving the stuff, thus
increasing the potential energy of the stuff as it moves through
either the pump or the battery.  In the fluid circuit, we are dealing
with gravitational potential energy and in the electric circuit with
electric potential energy.  Changes in kinetic energy will be
insignificant in the electric circuit case and will not be
considered.</li>

<p>

<li> The narrow pipe of length <i>a</i> offers <i>resistance</i> to
the flow of the fluid causing the gravitational potential energy of
the fluid to be dissipated and an equal amount of thermal energy to be
generated by the fluid moving downhill through the pipe.  Similarly,
the wire of the heating coil offers resistance to the motion of the
charged particles, causing the electric potential energy of the
charged particles to be dissipated and an equal amount of thermal energy
to be generated in the heating coil.  

<p>The connecting wires in the DC circuit have very little resistance
and are analogous to the wide very nearly horizontal pipes in the
fluid circuit.  The potential energy lost and corresponding amount of
thermal energy generated in either are negligible.</li>

<p>

<li>The potential energy that is continually being dissipated in the
narrow pipe or heating coil, respectively, is continually being
resupplied by the pump or battery.  Work must be done on the pump from
the outside at a rate equal to the rate at which the potential energy
of the fluid is being raised and then dissipated.  Similarly, chemical
energy stored in the battery is continually being converted at a rate
equal to the rate at which the potential energy of the charged
particles is being raised and then dissipated.  This is one aspect of
<b>energy conservation</b>.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>AC (Alternating Current) Circuits</b></p>

<p>The fluid flow analogy is not too useful in describing AC circuits.
Currents in AC circuits are changing direction and magnitude in a
periodic (sinusoidal) fashion.  Although one can imagine a pump
constantly alternating the direction in which it pumps fluid through a
circuit of pipes, it is difficult to represent a gain in gravitational
potential energy of the fluid in both directions.  However, this is
what happens in an AC circuit.</p>

<p>In an AC circuit, the battery is replaced by a power supply that
can alternate its polarity and move electric charges in alternating
directions through the circuit.  No matter whether the charges are
moved one way or the other, the power supply does work on the charges
and increases their potential energy.  As in the DC circuit case, this
potential energy is then dissipated and converted into thermal energy
when the charges move through an electric resistance.  It does not
matter in which direction they move through the resistance.  Potential
energy dissipation will occur both ways.</p>

<p>In an AC circuit, currents and potential differences change
direction and magnitude periodically (sinusoidally).  In North
American households, one uses AC circuits in which the currents and
potential differences change direction 100 times every second.  (The
frequency of the sinusoidal variation is 50 Hz.)</p>

<p>In calculations of the power dissipated in such a circuit, one can
replace the constantly changing instantaneous current and potential
difference values by average values, the so-called <i>rms</i> values.
'rms' stands for 'root-mean-square'.  These words summarize the way in
which this average is defined.  One does not need to know the details
in order to be able to use the rms values correctly.</p>

<p>For example, the voltage (potential difference) supplied in North
American households by the power company is 120 V.  This is the rms
value of the voltage.  The instantaneous value of the voltage at the
power outlets oscillates between -120x1.41 = - 169 V and + 169 V.  If
one multiplies this rms voltage by the rms current in a light bulb,
say 0.625 A, one obtains the rms power dissipated in the bulb,
120x0.625 = 75 W.</p>

<p>If one uses rms values for the currents, potential differences, and
powers in AC circuits, one can treat AC circuits formally as if they
were DC circuits, as long as all circuit elements in the given AC
circuit act like resistors.
