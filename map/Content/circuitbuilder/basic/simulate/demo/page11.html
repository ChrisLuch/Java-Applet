<p>There is now an open switch in the circuit.&nbsp; Select the switch
by clicking first on the Select Tool and then on the switch.&nbsp; The
system will then display information about the switch.&nbsp; Deselect
the Open Switch Button.&nbsp; This will close the switch.
</p>

<p>When the switch is closed, there will be a current in the circuit,
the ammeter will display its value as 1.2 A, and the voltmeter will
display the voltage across the resistor as 12.0 V.
</p>

<div class="title">Light Bulbs</div>

<p>Now insert a light bulb into the circuit between the battery and
the resistor.&nbsp; To do so, select the Light Bulb Tool (circuit
symbol:&nbsp;
   <img SRC="../../../images/lightButton.jpg" height=26 width=37 align=ABSCENTER>)
and then click on the wire segment where you want to insert the
bulb.&nbsp; When done, there will be a bulb in the circuit glowing
yellow.&nbsp; (This is assuming the switch is closed.&nbsp; If the
switch is open, the bulb should not light up.)
