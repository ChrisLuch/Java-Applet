<div class="title">Potentials</div>

<p>The electric potential has different
values at different points in the circuit.&nbsp; You can display its
value at a given grid point by selecting the Select Tool and then
clicking on the grid point.
</p>

<p>The program is set so that the potential
at the top left corner of the circuit is zero.&nbsp; This choice is arbitrary.&nbsp;
You can change the potential at any point, by clicking on that point and
entering a new value in the data field.&nbsp; This will automatically change
the potentials at all grid points so that for any two given points the
difference between their potentials does not change.
</p>

<p>The potential at a given point can be chosen arbitrarily, but the
difference between the potentials at two points cannot.  The latter is
an experimentally measurable quantity determined by the physical
conditions in the circuit.
</p>

<p>For example, the potential difference
across the resistor should be -12 V in the present case, going from
right to left.&nbsp; Thus, if you set the potential just to the right
of the resistor equal to 4 V, then it should become -8 V just to the
left of the resistor.&nbsp; This is assuming that the positive pole of
the battery is on the right.  Try it.
