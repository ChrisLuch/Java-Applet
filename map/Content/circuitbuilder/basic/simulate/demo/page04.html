<div class="title">Data Entry</div>

<p>The resistance of the resistor is currently set to 10 <font
face="Symbol">W</font>.&nbsp; You can change this value, or insert
other resistors into the circuit, as follows.
</p>

<p>The data entry field below the circuit diagram shows the resistance
value in scientific notation, with three significant digits.&nbsp
Click anywhere in this field.&nbsp; Once you have the cursor in the
entry field, use either the left or right arrows on the keyboard to
move the cursor to where you want it.&nbsp; Place the cursor just to
the left of the digit you want to change.&nbsp; Change the digit by
typing a new value on the keyboard or by using the up and down scroll
arrows next to the entry field.
</p>

<p>Then, if you click on some segment in the circuit, e.g., the
10-<font face="Symbol">W</font> resistor, a resistor will be inserted
there with the resistance value from the data entry field.
