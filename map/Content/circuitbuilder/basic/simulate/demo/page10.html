<p>The correct way to connect a voltmeter for measuring the voltage
across the resistor is shown on the left.
</p>

<p>If you click on the Select Tool and then on the voltmeter,
information related to the meter will be displayed.&nbsp; Change the
internal resistance of the meter and click the Calculator icon to
implement the change.&nbsp; Observe how the internal resistance of the
voltmeter affects the other readings.&nbsp; You will need to choose a fairly
low internal resistance to see a significant effect.

<p>Now insert a switch into the circuit that will interrupt the
current in the circuit.&nbsp; To do so, select the Switch Tool&nbsp;
<img SRC="../../../images/switchButton.jpg" BORDER=0 height=26 width=37
align=ABSCENTER> and then, in the Information Area below the circuit
diagram, select the Open Switch option by clicking the radio
button.&nbsp; Then click on the wire segment into which you want to
insert the switch.&nbsp; This will replace that segment by an open
switch.&nbsp; When you have done this correctly, the ammeter should
display 0 A and the voltmeter 0 V.
</p>

<p>To replace the switch with a closed one, deselect the Open Switch
option by clicking on it a second time and then click on the switch
again.  (When the Switch Tool is selected, clicking on any circuit
element will insert a switch in its place; in this case the open
switch will be replaced by a closed one.)
</p>

<p>On the next page, the circuit will be shown with an open switch
inserted.
