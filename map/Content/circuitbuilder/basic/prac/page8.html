<p><b>Resistance</b>.  What determines the magnitude of the current in
the fluid flow circuit shown on the left?  Let's assume the pump moves
just enough fluid to the higher elevation to supply what is drained
away from that point by the sloping narrow pipe.  In other words, the
pump is not putting pressure on the fluid at the entrance to the
sloping pipe.  This situation corresponds to the electric case.
</p>

<p>Under these conditions, the narrow pipe needs to be sloped so that
gravity will move the fluid through the pipe, and it is the rate at
which fluid moves through this pipe that determines the magnitude of
the current in the entire circuit.  One says the pipe has
<i>resistance</i>.  (Let us assume that the horizontal pipe is quite
wide and resistance-less and therefore does not need to be sloped.)
</p>

<p>The resistance of the narrow pipe is defined to be inversely
proportional to the current in the pipe.  The resistance is greater
the narrower and longer the pipe.  The resistance is due to friction
and causes the potential energy of the fluid to be dissipated in the
pipe in the form of heat as the fluid moves through the pipe.
</p>

<p>Similarly, in the electric circuit illustrated here, the wires and
battery have negligible resistance, but the heating coil is made of
different material and has quite a bit of resistance.  Therefore, the
coil determines the magnitude of the current in the circuit (given the
battery emf), and all of the electric potential energy gained by
charge when moving through the battery is given up by the charge and
converted into heat as the charge moves through the coil.
