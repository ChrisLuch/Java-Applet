<div class="title">DC Circuits</div>

<p><b>Current</b>.  The <i>current</i> at some point A in the fluid
flow circuit is defined as the rate at which fluid mass passes this
point, i.e., as the ratio
</p>

<p><center>(fluid mass past A in time interval
<font face="symbol">D</font>t)/<font face="symbol">D</font>t.</center>

<p>The electric current at some point A in the electric circuit is
defined analogously, with 'electric charge' replacing 'fluid mass'.
</p>

<p>Note that the current has the same magnitude at all points in these
circuits.  It is not larger near the top of the pump, nor larger near
the bottom of the sloping incline (similarly in the electric circuit).
The reason is that both mass and charge are conserved and do not
accumulate anywhere.  For example, if 0.5 kg are entering at the top
of the pipe every second, then 0.5 kg must be leaving the pipe at the
bottom every second, and 0.5 kg must be passing point A every second.
