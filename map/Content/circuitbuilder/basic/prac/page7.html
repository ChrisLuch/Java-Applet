<p><b>Emf</b>.  The <i>emf</i> of a battery is defined as the work
done on a charge q when the charge moves through the battery, divided
by q.
</p>

<p>If there is no 'friction' (internal resistance) inside the battery,
causing some of the work done by the battery to be dissipated as heat
inside the battery, the battery emf is equal to the potential
difference between the battery terminals.  If the battery does have
internal resistance, the terminal potential difference is less than
the emf because the increase in electrical potential energy of the
charge when moving through the battery is less than the total work
done on the charge by the battery.
</p>

<p>The symbol for emf is <font face="symbol">e</font>.  This is the
Greek letter 'epsilon'.  The SI-unit for emf is the same as for
electric potential, namely, the volt (V).
</p>

<p>The diagram illustrates a situation that can easily arise when a
12-V car battery is used to start up the engine.  The battery terminal
potential difference is somewhat less than the battery emf.  The
emptier the battery gets, the smaller the terminal potential
difference will be.  This is so because the internal resistance of the
battery increases as the battery gets emptier.  The emf remains at 12
V.
