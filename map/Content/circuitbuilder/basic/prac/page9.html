<div class="title">DC Circuits</div>

<p>The remaining pages in this session are based on the preceding
material and will deal with some practical considerations involving
electric circuits.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>.  Suppose you have a battery, a light bulb, and a
metal wire.  How can you connect the three together so that the bulb
will light?
</p>

<p>Three suggestions are shown on the left.  Which one(s) will work?
</p>

<p>Hint: For a bulb to burn, there must be a current in the bulb,
i.e., electric charges must be moving into the bulb at one end and out
the other.
