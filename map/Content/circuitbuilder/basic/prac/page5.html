<p><b>Energy Considerations</b>.  In raising the fluid from the bottom
to the top, the pump gives it gravitational potential energy.  This
energy is dissipated in the form of heat when the fluid encounters
friction while moving through the sloping narrow pipe.  Note that no
potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the fluid moves
down the pipe because the constancy of the current along the pipe
implies constant fluid speed, assuming the pipe's diameter is
constant.
</p>

<p>Actually, we will assume that the fluid speeds are small enough
that the kinetic energy of the fluid is negligible altogether.  A
narrow pipe can bring this about.  For electric circuits this is an
excellent assumption.
</p>

<p>What do you think is the speed with which electric charge moves in
a typical electric circuit?  This may surprise you, but the speed is
incredibly small.  Its order of magnitude is 1 meter per <b>hour</b>!
The speed is <b>not</b> something approaching the speed of light.
What <b>is</b> fast is the speed with which <b>changes</b> in one part
of a circuit are transmitted to another part.  E.g., if a switch is
closed in a circuit, the electric charges in a light bulb in the
circuit start moving and the bulb starts burning almost immediately,
not hours after the switch was closed.
