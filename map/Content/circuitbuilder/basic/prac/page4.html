<p><b>Conventional Current</b>.  Electric currents are not always made
of moving <b>negative</b> charges, as in metals.  For example, inside
a battery, the current consists of positively and negatively charged
ions moving in a liquid.  By the way, this is one instance where the
fluid analogy of electric current <b>fails</b> because the mass of
fluid particles can only be positive.
</p>

<p>If positive and negative charges are moving in an electric circuit,
they will always move in opposite directions.  Does this mean the
electric current has two different directions at once?
</p>

<p><b>No!</b> Positive charges moving left have in all respects the
same physical effects as negative charges moving right.  Using
financial transactions as an analogy, giving somebody 100 dollars
(positive money) is equivalent to removing a $100 debt (negative
money) from that person.  The person will have gained equally in both
cases.
</p>

<p>Therefore one can <b>define</b> a single direction of electric
current. This is the direction in which equivalent positive charges
would move.  If a current consists entirely of moving negative
charges, this <b>conventional</b> current direction is opposite to the
motion of the charges, because positive charges constituting an
equivalent current would move in the opposite direction.
</p>

<p>It is easiest in most cases to simply forget about whether the
charges constituting the current are positive or negative or a mixture
of the two, and to imagine them all to be positive.
