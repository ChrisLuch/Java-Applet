<center><b>Electric Current</b></center>

<p>The remaining pages will take you through several exercises
involving currents in circuits.  Light bulbs will be inserted into the
circuits to provide resistance and to indicate the currents.

<p>The circuit shown here contains a 6-V battery and a light bulb.
The circuit is not closed because of an open switch.  <b>Close the
switch</b> and observe the current direction.

<p>When the switch is closed, there is a current in the circuit whose
direction (outside of the battery) is clockwise, from the positive
pole (longer bar at the top of the battery) to the negative pole
(shorter bar).  This is the <i>conventional current direction</i>.

<p>One defines the <i>conventional current direction</i> as the
direction in which positive charge would move (even if only negative
movable charge is present).

<p>In a metal wire, the movable electric charge resides on particles
called electrons, which are negatively charged.  They move in the
direction opposite to the conventional current direction.  Inside a
battery, there are movable charged particles called ions.  Some of
these carry positive charge, others negative charge.  In the situation
on the left, the positive ions inside the battery move upward, in the
same direction as the conventional current, and the negative ions
downward.

<p><b>Task</b>: Insert an ammeter into the circuit to measure the
current in the bulb and record the current, both when the switch is
open and closed.
