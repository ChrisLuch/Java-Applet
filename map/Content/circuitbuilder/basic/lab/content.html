<p>Here is an experiment on short circuits that you can do at home.
From it you can learn something about resistance and current and
circuits in general.</p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="shortcircuit.gif"></p>

<ol>

<li>From a pad of steel wool, select the thinnest strand you can find.
Stretch the strand out on the table.  In the diagram above this is the
iron wire.</li>

<li>Connect two thick copper wires to the terminals of a 1.5-V
battery, one at each terminal.  These are the heavier wires in the
diagram.</li>

<li>Make the steel wire touch the copper wires in such a way that the
points of contact are about 2 cm apart.  The steel wire will get warm.</li>

<li>Decrease the separation between the points of contact.  When the
separation is around a millimeter, the steel wire will glow white hot
like a light bulb and then melt.  See if you can cause the wire to
melt and thus break the short circuit.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>Explanation</b>.  Iron (or steel) has a greater resistivity than
copper.  This means that if you have two wires that are identical in
length and in diameter, but one of them made of iron and the other one
of copper, then the copper wire will have quite a bit less resistance
than the iron wire.  In this experiment we have an iron wire that is
much thinner than the copper wires and therefore has an even greater
resistance than the copper wires.  Thus, if there is several
centimeter of iron wire between the contact points, there is still
some resistance in the circuit and we don't have a short circuit quite
yet.</p>

<p>However, the shorter you make the piece of iron wire between the
contacts, the smaller the resistance in the circuit will become and
you will have more and more of a "short circuit".  As the resistance
in the circuit gets smaller, the current gets larger.  As the current
in a resistor increases, more power is dissipated in the resistor and
the resistor gets hotter.  The power dissipated in a resistor depends
on two things: the current in the resistor and the resistance of the
resistor.  The reason the copper wires do not get as hot as the steel
wire even though they carry the same current is that the copper wires
do not have as much resistance per unit length as the steel wire.</p>
