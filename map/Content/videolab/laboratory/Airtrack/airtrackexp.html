<h1 align="left"> <font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this 
  experiment you will be able to look at the motion of a car without actually 
  examining the cause of this motion. You will analyze the distance, velocity 
  and acceleration of the car. Specifically by constructing and distance-time 
  graph and using this graph to find the velocity of the car. Also a velocity-time 
  graph will be constructed and from this you will be able to determine the acceleration. 
  It is important to note the difference between average and instantaneous quantities.</font></h1>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The equipment consists 
  of a car that moves along an air-track due to a spring and a suspended mass. 
  The car is released from one end and moves toward the other, the spring eventually 
  stops the car from moving. You will need the x versus t data, paste the data 
  into a spreadsheet and construct an instantaneous velocity verus time graph, 
  and an instantaneous acceleration versus time graph. Do this for both the light 
  and heavy masses. Play the video to see the motion, click on the links below 
  to go to the lab. </b></font></p>
