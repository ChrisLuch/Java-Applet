	<p><b>Angular velocity as a vector quantity</b>.  The definition of
	angular velocity on Page 1 defines angular velocity as a scalar.  It is
	possible to define angular velocity as a vector <img
	src="omega.gif" align="bottom">.  This definition involves a
	right-hand rule that is illustrated in Figure 3 below.  The scalar
	angular velocity defined above is the scalar component of the
	vector <img src="omega.gif" align="bottom"> in the direction of
	<img src="omega.gif" align="bottom">.

   <p align="center"><b>Figure 3</b></p>
	
	<p>The angular velocity vector of a particle is perpendicular to
	the plane spanned by the particle's position vector <img
	src="r.gif" align="bottom"> relative to some reference point O and
	the particle's velocity vector <img src="v.gif"
	align="bottom">. There are two directions in which this
	perpendicular can point.  The following right-hand rule determines
	which one it is.

	<p>Point the outstretched fingers of the right hand from the
	reference point O to the moving particle, i.e., in the direction of
	the position vector <img src="r.gif" align="bottom">, so that the
	palm faces in the direction of the particle's velocity <img
	src="v.gif" align="bottom"> and so that the fingers can be curled
	towards that velocity.  Then the thumb will point in the direction
	of the angular velocity <img src="omega.gif" align="bottom">.

	<p>In the case of the car's motion illustrated in Figure 1 on Page
	1, the car's velocity is to the left, generally speaking, and its
	angular velocity vector is out of the screen towards the viewer.

	<p>The magnitude of the angular velocity vector is equal to the
	angular speed as defined on Page 2.
