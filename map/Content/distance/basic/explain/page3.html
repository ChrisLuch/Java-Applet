<p><b>Some Properties of Distance Traveled and Distance</b>

<p><ul>

<li>Both the distance between two points (magnitude of the
displacement from one point to the other) and the distance traveled
along a path are <b>scalar</b> quantities.</li>

<p><li>Distance traveled is an <i>additive</i> quantity.  To see what
that means, go to the applet on Page 2, drag the ball along some
curve, note the distance traveled, and then drag the ball again.  The
new distance traveled must be added to the old one to give the overall
distance traveled.  Distance traveled is what is shown by a car's
odometer.

<p>In contrast, the magnitude of the displacement is <b>not</b>
additive.  Drag the ball through two successive displacements.  The
sum of the magnitudes of the two displacements is in general
<b>not</b> equal to the magnitude of the total displacement.</li>

<p><li>Drag the ball along a curve and compare the distance traveled
and the magnitude of the displacement.  The former will be greater
than the latter.  Why?</li>

</ul>
