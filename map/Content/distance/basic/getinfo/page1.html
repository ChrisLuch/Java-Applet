  <div class="title">Distance Traveled and Distance</div>

  <p align="center"><img src="Displacementcurved.jpg"></p>

  <p>The diagram shows a ball that has been moved from the initial
  position <img src="r.gif" align="bottom"><sub>i</sub> =
  (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>i</sub> = (10.0,-15.0) m to the final
  position <img src="r.gif" align="bottom"><sub>f</sub> =
  (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)<sub>f</sub> = (-20.0,-10.1) m along the curved
  path shown in blue. The green arrow represents the ball's
  displacement <img src="d.gif" align="bottom">.

  <p>The <i>distance traveled</i> by the ball is measured along the
  path taken by the ball and is equal to the length of the blue curve
  in the diagram.  Distance traveled is often denoted by the symbol
  <i>s</i>. This is the notation used in MAP.

  <p>In the example shown in the diagram, <i>s</i> is equal to

  <p align="center"><i>s</i> = 33.6 m .</p>

  <p>The distance traveled must be distinguished from the
  straight-line distance between the initial and final positions of
  the ball.  When one talks of the <i>distance</i> between two points,
  one usually means the straight-line distance unless it is clear from
  the context that one means the distance along some curved path
  connecting the points.

  <p>The straight-line distance between the initial and final
  positions of the ball is equal to the magnitude <i>d</i> of the
  ball's displacement and is denoted by the symbol <i>d</i> as well.

  <p>In the case illustrated above, <i>d</i> has the value

  <p align="center"><i>d</i> = 30.4 m .</p>

  <p><i>d</i> is less than <i>s</i> whenever the path traveled is
  curved.  A straight line is the shortest connection between two
  points.
